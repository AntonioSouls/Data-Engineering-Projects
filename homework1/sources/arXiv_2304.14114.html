<p id="id2.2" class="ltx_p">Weakly supervised object detection (WSOD) aims at learning precise object detectors with only image-level tags. In spite of intensive research on deep learning (DL) approaches over the past few years, there is still a significant performance gap between WSOD and fully supervised object detection. In fact, most existing WSOD methods only consider the visual appearance of each region proposal but ignore employing the useful context information in the image. To this end, this paper proposes an interactive end-to-end WSDO framework called JLWSOD with two innovations: i) two types of WSOD-specific context information (i.e., <span id="id2.2.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">instance-wise correlation</span> and <span id="id2.2.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">semantic-wise correlation</span>) are proposed and introduced into WSOD framework; ii) an <span id="id2.2.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">interactive graph contrastive learning</span> (iGCL) mechanism is designed to jointly optimize the visual appearance and context information for better WSOD performance. Specifically, the iGCL mechanism takes full advantage of the complementary interpretations of the WSOD, namely instance-wise detection and semantic-wise prediction tasks, forming a more comprehensive solution. Extensive experiments on the widely used PASCAL VOC and MS COCO benchmarks verify the superiority of JLWSOD over alternative state-of-the-art approaches and baseline models (improvement of 3.6%<math id="id1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\sim" display="inline"><semantics id="id1.1.m1.1a"><mo id="id1.1.m1.1.1" xref="id1.1.m1.1.1.cmml">∼</mo><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="id1.1.m1.1b"><csymbol cd="latexml" id="id1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="id1.1.m1.1.1">similar-to</csymbol></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="id1.1.m1.1c">\sim</annotation></semantics></math>23.3% on mAP and 3.4%<math id="id2.2.m2.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\sim" display="inline"><semantics id="id2.2.m2.1a"><mo id="id2.2.m2.1.1" xref="id2.2.m2.1.1.cmml">∼</mo><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="id2.2.m2.1b"><csymbol cd="latexml" id="id2.2.m2.1.1.cmml" xref="id2.2.m2.1.1">similar-to</csymbol></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="id2.2.m2.1c">\sim</annotation></semantics></math>19.7% on CorLoc, respectively).</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Recently, with the advancement of computer vision object detection, has made great progress <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>. Unfortunately, the training for a fully supervised object detection model demands a large number of images with bounding-box annotations (i.e., the labeled ground-truth for the actual objects) which limits the further development of object detection. To alleviate the heavy burden of time-consuming manual labeling procedure to collect bounding-box annotations, weakly supervised object detection (WSOD) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite> was recently proposed that <span id="S1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">only</span> requires image-level annotations to train object detector. However, the absence of bounding-box level annotations in WSOD causes severe problems, such as region proposal ambiguity and poor-quality bounding box proposals (i.e., the detected object). Consequently, learning object detectors under weak supervision is much more challenging compared to fully supervised scenarios <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Although existing weakly supervised object detectors can effectively facilitate the WSOD procedure, they do not consider an important information source: <span id="S1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">context information</span>, when inferring the scores of <span id="S1.p2.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">bounding box regions</span> (hereafter called <span id="S1.p2.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">instances</span> or <span id="S1.p2.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">proposals</span>). In fact, under a weakly supervised learning scenarios, the critical challenge is the lack of accurate instance-level annotations. By employing context information, strong predictive capacity can make up for the lack of concrete annotations in weakly supervised learning and therefore increases the robustness in the learning procedure (see Figure <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ I Introduction ‣ Towards Precise Weakly Supervised Object Detection via Interactive Contrastive Learning of Context Information" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a> right part).</p>

<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Context information is designed to subject to applications. Currently, context information (i.e., joint feature of both local feature and surrounding context) has been successfully applied to different areas such as video analysis <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>, image captioning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>, and semantic segmentation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite> under fully supervised learning. However, such context information for fully supervised learning cannot be easily applied to WSOD task. Therefore, WSOD-specific context information must be designed.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">In WSOD tasks, object localization and semantic ambiguity are two key challenges. In object localization, if precise detection results are necessary to obtain, i.e., localizing the whole object instead of only parts of an object, “local view to global view” correlation and “foreground to background” correlation must be <span id="S1.p4.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">jointly</span> taken into consideration. Such <span id="S1.p4.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">jointly</span> learned correlation among instances is called <span id="S1.p4.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">instance-wise correlation</span>. In semantic ambiguity, if the weakly supervised object detector cannot consider the semantic correlation between each instance, the detector will simply formulate the detection task as a common classification task. So that the detector will assign the wrong category label to the instance within the image. Such semantic correlation between each instance is <span id="S1.p4.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">semantic-wise correlation</span>. By introducing the instance-wise correlation and the semantic-wise correlation, the cognitive process and prediction process of visual appearance can be included in the WSOD framework to achieve better detection performance.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">For these reasons, this work proposes to introduce these two types of WSOD-specific context information, i.e., <span id="S1.p5.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">instance-wise correlation</span> and <span id="S1.p5.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">semantic-wise correlation</span>. Specifically, the correlation of the spatially adjacent instances for instance-wise detection (see Figure <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ I Introduction ‣ Towards Precise Weakly Supervised Object Detection via Interactive Contrastive Learning of Context Information" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>) is modeled in order to infer the detection score of each instance. In fact, two significant information can be provided by instance-wise correlation for the detection of the target object locations: 1) The correlation between the local view (i.e., instances) and the global view (i.e., images); 2) The correlation between the foreground (target object) and the background. By exploring the first correlation, the model can identify the features of some discriminative object parts, that are aggregated into the instances covering the whole object. Meanwhile, with the second correlation, the model can make use of the background to identify the object locations, e.g., a boat should be on the lake.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">To overcome semantic ambiguity, we introduce semantic-wise correlation. It models the intrinsic correlation of co-occurring objects in different categories and facilitates semantic-wise prediction (see Figure <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ I Introduction ‣ Towards Precise Weakly Supervised Object Detection via Interactive Contrastive Learning of Context Information" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>). Semantic-wise correlation helps separate item categories that may occur in an image, particularly under WSOD where the information/features utilized to recognize objects can textitonly be collected through (multi-label) image classification operation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>. Consequently, enhancing multi-label image classification by analyzing semantic-wise association may facilitate the acquisition of semantic features for better WSOD performance.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p7" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p7.1" class="ltx_p">Since these correlations are under weakly supervising scenarios where only image-level labels are available, a self-supervised learning method is necessary. Following the immense success of <span id="S1.p7.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">contrastive learning</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>, <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>, <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite> on self-supervised learning, the graph contrastive learning is employed to learn the two correlations in our WSOD task. However, one technical difficulty arises, contrastive learning can only <span id="S1.p7.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">independently</span> learn one type of correlation (i.e., instance-wise correlation or each semantic-wise correlation) while practically these two correlations must be jointly learned. This issue remains unresolved and nontrivial to jointly optimize both correlations.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p8" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p8.1" class="ltx_p">To fill in this blank, a novel interactive end-to-end WSOD framework (Figure <a href="#S1.F2" title="Figure 2 ‣ I Introduction ‣ Towards Precise Weakly Supervised Object Detection via Interactive Contrastive Learning of Context Information" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>) is designed based on interactive contrastive learning of context information. In detail, our WSOD framework is proposed that consists of an <span id="S1.p8.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">instance-wise detection branch</span>, a <span id="S1.p8.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">semantic-wise prediction branch</span>, and a newly designed <span id="S1.p8.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">interactive graph contrastive learning</span> module (iGCL). Since our framework <span id="S1.p8.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">jointly</span> leverages instance-wise and semantic-wise information for WSOD, it is called JLWSOD whose workflow is illustrated in Figure <a href="#S1.F2" title="Figure 2 ‣ I Introduction ‣ Towards Precise Weakly Supervised Object Detection via Interactive Contrastive Learning of Context Information" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>. Compared to the existing WSOD frameworks, our JLWSOD can successfully capture different types of context information through the instance-wise detection branch and the semantic-wise prediction branch, which are then jointly optimized through the proposed iGCL interactively. Furthermore, JLWSOD has the ability to conduct inferences at both the instance-level and the semantic-level, which is unexplored in other studies. In summary, the contributions of this paper are as below:</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p9" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p9.1" class="ltx_p">i) Two new WSOD-specific <span id="S1.p9.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">context information</span> (i.e., <span id="S1.p9.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">instance-wise</span> and <span id="S1.p9.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">semantic-wise correlation</span>) are proposed to address the two key challenges in WSOD, namely, object localization and semantic ambiguity, respectively. In this way, our proposed method has inference capacity at the instance-level and semantic-level, which is beyond the exploration of the existing works.</p>

<div id="S1.p10" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p10.1" class="ltx_p">ii) An interactive end-to-end WSOD framework is designed in which the two WSOD-specific context information are separately captured by contrastive learning. Through our newly designed iGCL module, the captured instance-wise and the semantic-wise correlations can be jointly optimized, i.e., complemented by the interactive contrastive learning mechanism so that the object detection performance can be improved, especially on large data sets. This is a non-trivial challenging task because only image-level labels are always available in the training dataset.</p>

<div id="S2.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Weakly-supervised object detection (WSOD) attracts great interest due to they mainly rely on image-level annotation, which can alleviate the demand for expensive instance-level annotations.
For this reason, the WSOD learning framework faces a double challenge. The first challenge is the typical issues (e.g., the intra-class variations in appearance, transformation, scale and aspect ratio) which also encountered in the conventional fully supervised object detection task. The second challenge is the learning efficiency under uncertain challenges caused by the inconsistency between human annotations and real supervisory signals <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Most existing WSOD methods <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite> adopt multiple instance learning (MIL) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite> framework to transform object detection (or <span id="S2.SS1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">instance</span> classification) task into image classification (or <span id="S2.SS1.p2.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">bag</span> classification) task. In MIL, the labeled images are considered as bags and unlabeled image patches (divided from labeled images) as instances. Then, instance classifiers (or object detectors) are trained under MIL constraints, which ensures a positive bag contains at least one positive instance and negative bag contains only negative instances. Currently, MIL framework has become the mainstream for WSOD for its promising results to a certain extent. To further improve WSOD performance, many recent WSOD networks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite> and their variants <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite> employ multi-phase network architecture to implement deep MIL detector. In addition, MIL and deep networks are combined by using end-to-end training <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>, <a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite> to achieve better results for WSOD.
Due to the absence of instance-level annotations, the performance difference between WSOD and fully supervised object identification remains substantial. For this reason, follow-up works further improve performance through self-training <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite>, knowledge transfer <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>, <a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>, <a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite>, etc. But they <span id="S2.SS1.p2.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">only</span> employ one type of input in the training process. In terms of WSOD, the accuracy of object detection and learning procedure are closely related. In the learning procedure, it is crucial to propagate image-level supervisory signals to instance-level (i.e., bounding box-level) training data. Therefore, a framework that can comprehensively consider all useful information in the learning procedure and realize <span id="S2.SS1.p2.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">joint</span> learning is necessary. This is the research objective of our proposed JLWSOD.</p>

<p id="S2.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Contrastive learning is a class of self-supervised approaches that train an encoder to be contrastive between the representations that depict statistical dependencies of interest and those that do not. The majority of these approaches use instance discrimination <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib40" title="" class="ltx_ref">40</a>]</cite> as a pretext task to pre-train a network and then fine-tune it for downstream tasks (e.g., classification, object detection, and segmentation). Contrastive learning aims at minimizing the distance between the instances with similar semantics (i.e., positive pairs) and meanwhile stretching away those with divergent semantics (i.e., negative pairs). In particular, Xie et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite> introduce global view (original image) and local view (instance/proposals) contrastive learning for pretraining and then transfers the trained model to the object detection task. Wang et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">39</a>]</cite> propose a Pseudo Group Contrast (PGC) mechanism to reduce the reliance on pseudo-labels and increase the tolerance for erroneous pseudo-labels in self-training. For better regional features and corresponding semantic descriptions, Yan et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>]</cite> propose a semantics-guided contrastive network that is beneficial to a variety of downstream tasks. However, all these methods only work on one type of input, such as semantic-wise information or instance-wise information, and cannot do contrastive learning across multiple different information. To alleviate the problem of error amplification caused by inaccurate false labels, and to mine, more unlabeled instances in object detection, an interactive graph contrastive learning module (iGCL) is designed in our JLWSOD. Note that iGCL is applied to incorporate the context information without an extra momentum encoder. Therefore, learning efficiency is kept fast even under an interactive learning mechanism.</p>

<p id="S4.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Our method is based on ResNet50 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>]</cite>, which is pre-trained on the training set of each dataset. To reduce the number of inaccurate instances, we filter out the instances whose width or height is smaller than 16 pixels. During training, the mini-batch size for SGD is respectively set to be 4, and 32 for VOC 2007, and MS-COCO. An initial learning rate is set to 1e-3 for the first 40, 15, and 85K iterations for the VOC 2007 and MS-COCO datasets, respectively. Then the learning rate is decreased to 1e-4 in the following 10, and 20K iterations for the VOC 2007 and MS-COCO datasets, respectively. The momentum and weight decay are set to be 0.9 and 0.0005 respectively. All our experiments are run on NVIDIA GTX 1080Ti GPU with 16 RAM memory.</p>

This is because most of the images belonging to the PASCAL VOC 2007 dataset only contain one object category or one big object, while the images belonging to COCO datasets always contain multiple object categories. For this reason, the correlations between instance-wise or semantic-wise in COCO datasets are more abundant. Therefore, JLWSOD achieves significant improvement on the COCO dataset than on PASCAL VOC 2007 dataset. Here, we give some visualized results obtained by our proposed method in Figure <a href="#S4.F4" title="Figure 4 ‣ IV-C Results and Comparisons ‣ IV Experiments ‣ Towards Precise Weakly Supervised Object Detection via Interactive Contrastive Learning of Context Information" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a>.</p>

However, the effect of M2 is far less than that of M1 because the semantic-wise prediction module (M2) has a higher demand for accurate labels than the object detection module (M1). To our best knowledge, the single-category nature of the majority of PASCAL VOC object images, resulting in weak correlations across different semantics, is the primary source of this issue. It significantly reduces the expected effectiveness of semantic-wise prediction branch (M2). Additionally, the majority of images in PASCAL VOC are foreground object images, i.e., a single item spans the majority of pixels, which causes the previous methods to locate only the incomplete object regions. Therefore, there are helpful instance-wise correlations between instances covering different parts of the target object, so the instance detection branch (M1) can obtain more excellent improvement in the overall performance. Of course, it is also possible that under weakly supervised environment, M2 alone cannot obtain enough information for training. Therefore, how to obtain accurate semantic labels under weak supervision is still a big challenge.</p>

<p id="S5.p1.2" class="ltx_p">In this paper, an interactive end-to-end WSOD framework called JLWSOD is presented which involves three novel modules: i) instance-wise detection branch, ii) semantic-wise prediction branch, iii) interactive graph contrastive (iGCL). The first two modules can learn the two types of WSOD-specific context information, i.e., the instance-wise correlation and the semantic-wise correlation via contrastive learning. Meanwhile, iGCL interactively incorporates two types of context information for <span id="S5.p1.2.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">joint</span> optimization. Hence, JLWSOD can be endowed with instance-level and semantic-level reasoning capabilities, which are beyond the exploration of many previous works. Extensive experiments verify the superiority of JLWSOD which improves 3.6%<math id="S5.p1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\sim" display="inline"><semantics id="S5.p1.1.m1.1a"><mo id="S5.p1.1.m1.1.1" xref="S5.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml">∼</mo><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S5.p1.1.m1.1b"><csymbol cd="latexml" id="S5.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S5.p1.1.m1.1.1">similar-to</csymbol></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S5.p1.1.m1.1c">\sim</annotation></semantics></math>23.3% on mAP and 3.4%<math id="S5.p1.2.m2.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\sim" display="inline"><semantics id="S5.p1.2.m2.1a"><mo id="S5.p1.2.m2.1.1" xref="S5.p1.2.m2.1.1.cmml">∼</mo><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S5.p1.2.m2.1b"><csymbol cd="latexml" id="S5.p1.2.m2.1.1.cmml" xref="S5.p1.2.m2.1.1">similar-to</csymbol></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S5.p1.2.m2.1c">\sim</annotation></semantics></math>19.7% on CorLoc compared with other state-of-the-art methods. However, a drawback of our approach is that the precision of pseudo labels obtained by semantic-wise prediction branch is limited, which cannot sufficiently guide the subsequent WSOD task. Further explorations of semantic mechanisms under weakly supervised scenarios may further improve the performance of WSOD and are left as future work.</p>
