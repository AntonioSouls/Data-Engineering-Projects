<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">Recent years have witnessed huge successes in 3D object detection to recognize common objects for autonomous driving (e.g., <span id="id1.id1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">vehicles</span> and <span id="id1.id1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">pedestrians</span>). However, most methods rely heavily on a large amount of well-labeled training data. This limits their capability of detecting rare fine-grained objects (e.g., <span id="id1.id1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">police cars</span> and <span id="id1.id1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">ambulances</span>), which is important for special cases, such as emergency rescue, and so on. To achieve simultaneous detection for both common and rare objects, we propose a novel task, called generalized few-shot 3D object detection, where we have a large amount of training data for common (base) objects, but only a few data for rare (novel) classes. Specifically, we analyze in-depth differences between images and point clouds, and then present a practical principle for the few-shot setting in the 3D LiDAR dataset. To solve this task, we propose a simple and effective detection framework, including (1) an incremental fine-tuning method to extend existing 3D detection models to recognize both common and rare objects, and (2) a sample adaptive balance loss to alleviate the issue of long-tailed data distribution in autonomous driving scenarios.
On the nuScenes dataset, we conduct sufficient experiments to demonstrate that our approach can successfully detect the rare (novel) classes that contain only a few training data, while also maintaining the detection accuracy of common objects.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Object detection of the point cloud is a task of great interest, especially according to the flourishing of the application of 3D LiDAR in autonomous driving scenarios.
Many object detection works <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite> carry out the effort on a large amount of annotated LiDAR point cloud benchmarks, such as nuScenes <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>, KITTI <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>, Waymo <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>, ONCE <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>, and so on.
Most of them have a few categories of objects, such as Waymo and KITTI, where mainly three categories of objects, <span id="S1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">i.e.</span> <span id="S1.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">vehicles</span>, <span id="S1.p1.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">pedestrians</span>, and <span id="S1.p1.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">bicycles</span>, are considered for object detection.
Many 3D works <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite> have explored the detection of these three categories, and rely on extensive labeled data for learning.
It is worth noting that there are much more types of objects than these three in an autonomous driving scenario.
For example, nuScenes provides more detailed annotations of 23 types of objects.
However, most of the existing works cannot detect these uncommon objects, because of the shortage of samples.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Detecting objects on the road with a wide range of categories is important and basic for environmental perception and autonomous driving.
For example, vehicles should avoid police cars or ambulances on the street, as they may carry out emergency pursuit or rescue work.
In addition, vehicles need to keep away from those objects of poor avoidance ability, such as strollers and wheelchairs, in order to ensure their safety.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Although these objects rarely appear on the street, once autonomous driving vehicles fail to detect them, they will not be able to make timely avoidance and cause traffic accidents.
So object detection for these uncommon categories is also of great interest.
We have done a detailed statistical analysis of the nuScenes dataset, as shown in
Fig. <a href="#S0.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ Generalized Few-Shot 3D Object Detection of LiDAR Point Cloud for Autonomous Driving" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>, there are 23 categories of annotated objects which represent a long-tail distribution in real-world scenarios.
Among the categories of objects on the street, a large number of objects are concentrated in a few categories, like <span id="S1.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">car</span> and <span id="S1.p3.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">adult</span>.
Many categories, such as <span id="S1.p3.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">stroller</span> and <span id="S1.p3.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">police</span>, do not appear very often.
However, previous methods have chosen to intentionally ignore these uncommon categories, because it is difficult to achieve better training results with less data.
In nuScenes dataset, only 10 large categories are detected and evaluated for actual detection.
However, there are still good reasons to add more classes of objects to the original detection, even with a few training samples.
Inspired by 2D few-shot object detection, we would like to detect objects in these categories with a smaller number of samples.
</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">In the 2D field, there exist many approaches to detect novel objects with only a few data available (few-shot detection) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite> and alleviate the long-tail problem <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>. However, it is still a blank to detect rare objects with a few samples in terms of the 3D LiDAR point cloud.
Directly bringing 2D few-shot solutions to 3D is infeasible.
Firstly, 3D LiDAR point clouds are very sparse compared to the images.
For example, most of the background areas in the whole scene are devoid of points, and an individual object may contain only a few points. The points will be concentrated on the surface of the object, where nearer points are denser and further ones are sparser. However, in image data, pixels are usually dense and uniform.
Moreover, the point cloud lacks the texture information in the image, which leads to difficulty in semantic analysis. For example, it is hard to distinguish between adults, police officers and construction workers using spatial structure information alone.
Thirdly, the number of objects contained in a point cloud scene is much larger than that in an image.
We meet more disturbances since there are many objects of the common classes and a very small number of the additional classes.
Therefore, to detect the additional classes of objects in the point cloud, it is not feasible to simply use the few-shot detection method in images for point clouds.

<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we propose a practical principle for the few-shot setting in the 3D LiDAR dataset to detect additional classes of objects, by in-depth analyzing the differences between images and point clouds.
We propose a few-shot 3D object detection method. For uncommon category objects in the point cloud data, we merely require a few annotated objects in learning. Our method is trained at a low cost through training an existing 3D object detector.
We should also note that although we want to focus on the uncommon category of objects, if the detection of common objects decreases significantly to detect objects that rarely appear, it is not worth the loss. So we aim to increase the detection of uncommon objects while the detection of common objects remains largely unchanged.
We utilize incremental learning for the additional categories, which ensures the model better generalizes to additional classes and better adapts to the long-tail distribution of the data in real life.
In addition, to solve the category imbalance and hard sample disturbance during training, we design a sample adaptive balance (SAB) loss which focuses more on the distinction between objects of the additional and the common categories.
Our method also reduces the mutual inhibitory effect between the common and the additional classes, thus retaining the detection rate of the common class and responding to objects of additional categories at the same time.</p>

An intuitive idea is to transform the 3D point cloud into a 2D form from the bird-eye view (BEV) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>, <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite> so that a 2D convolutional network could efficiently process on it.
A better way to produce regular data organization from point clouds is to utilize a regular grid, such as VoxelNet <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>.

<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib43" title="" class="ltx_ref">43</a>]</cite> starts to explore the few-shot problem on point cloud semantic segmentation tasks. But few-shot 3D object detection on the LiDAR point cloud has not yet been explored.

Since it is important to perceive the few-shot novel classes and keep a reliable detection rate in autonomous driving, we inherit the core idea of incremental learning to deal with few-shot 3D object detection and proposed individual branches for each novel class to decrease the affection between the novel and the base classes.</p>

<div id="S3.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Current mainstream methods of 3D detection in autonomous driving scenarios only focus on detecting common objects, which are usually seen on the road or street in the real world. However, detecting rare objects, such as police cars or strollers, are very critical but less explored topic for the autonomous driving system. Most existing models relying on large amounts of training data are not suitable to detect rare objects, since it is costly and more difficult to collect enough data for rare objects than common ones. For example, The nuScenes dataset collects 15 hours of driving data, but only obtains 26 rare ‘police’, while the number of common ‘car’ reaches 27701. If we want to provide enough amount of ‘police’ similar to ‘car’, we may need to collect 15,000 hours of driving data and pay more human-cost for annotation. Therefore, current methods are not practical and economical approaches to detecting rare objects. In this paper, we aim to explore the solution of detecting both common and rare objects, which can make full use of 3D driving data with long-tail distribution, <span id="S3.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">i.e.</span>,
the large number of common objects and a few rare objects. To do this, we propose a new task, called the generalized few-shot 3D object detection, and provide a reasonable set of benchmarks according to the characteristic and long-tail distribution of 3D driving data. Besides, we compare our 3D task with few-shot 2D object detection to explain the differences between these two tasks.</p>

Considering current mainstream datasets of 3D object detection, only the nuScenes dataset has the most categories and is more suitable for the few-shot 3D object detection task. Specifically, the nuScenes dataset provides 23 categories with annotated bounding boxes.

We use the original train and validation sets in nuScenes as the corresponding sets of our base classes, respectively.
For the novel classes, we try to use the ignored nine categories, however, we find that some categories are not suitable for our task, because of the too small amount of instances, and large intra-class variations in terms of morphology and size.</p>

To evaluate the model’s ability in few-shot learning, the number of testing samples is usually larger than the training sample in each novel class. According to this principle, we remove the <span id="S3.SS1.p4.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">wheelchair</span> and <span id="S3.SS1.p4.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">ambulance</span> classes, since the number of instances in each class is less than 20, and we can not obtain enough testing samples.</p>

In addition, the volume of some objects is very small, so the number of points contained in the sample is often very small. For example, the category <span id="S3.SS1.p5.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">pensonal_mobility</span> is defined as small electric or self-propelled vehicle, e.g. skateboard, segway, or scooter, on which the person typically travels in an upright position. Driver and (if applicable) rider should be included in the bounding box along with the vehicle. Obviously, these objects contain a small percentage of points compared to the points of the people in the same box. Most of the points in the box are provided by pedestrians, and it is hard to distinguish the difference between people and <span id="S3.SS1.p5.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">pensonal_mobility</span> by such few points provided by the small vehicle. So we remove the <span id="S3.SS1.p5.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">pensonal_mobility</span> class.</p>

Furthermore, they are not even a collection of objects with the same shape and characteristics. After visualizing the data of these categories, we found that the category of <span id="S3.SS1.p6.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">animals</span> includes cats, rats, dogs, birds, etc., and <span id="S3.SS1.p6.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">debris</span> includes trash bags, temporary road signs and tree branches, etc. The objects in these categories have large morphological and size variations and do not even share some common properties in terms of structure. This obviously can not be handled by only using point cloud data without color and texture information. Thus, we also remove the <span id="S3.SS1.p6.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">animal</span> and <span id="S3.SS1.p6.1.5" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">debris</span> classes.</p>

Notice that the <span id="S3.SS1.p7.1.5" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">pushable_pullable</span> category has different objects, such as wheelbarrows, garbage bins with wheels, or shopping carts, however, they have similar shape properties.

<span id="S3.SS1.p8.1.1" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">
First of all, due to the small number of samples in the validation set, the evaluation results for rare classes on the official validation set are not convincing. Therefore, it is necessary to supplement some samples from the training set to enrich the number of samples of rare objects. Specifically, we ensure that there are 10 instances of training data for each class of objects in the training set, and we randomly select some of the remaining objects to add to the validation set. It is worth mentioning that objects in the rare category are heavily occluded. For example, we can find from Table II that more than 50% of the visible areas of the stroller in the official validation set are less than 40%. Therefore, in the process of randomly selecting objects from the training set to the validation set, we try to select some objects with high visibility rather than the full complement. The occlusion degree of each category in the supplemented validation set can be seen in Table II. To some extent, we alleviate the excessive occlusion of some categories of objects.</span></p>

In few-shot 2D detection, an image is regarded as one shot, since it has contained a complete object. However, in 3D point cloud data, an instance usually has multiple frames captured by the LiDAR detection vehicle at different times and distances. If we only use a frame as one shot, we cannot utilize all information of an object. Thus, we treat all moments of samples of an instance as one shot of the object.

Differently, in 3D object detection, dozens to hundreds of objects exist in a scene.
If we continue to follow the setting of 2D few-shot object detection by only giving the label of one novel object in a sample, and ignoring the labels of other objects, the model will suppress the objects of other classes in the same frame as the background. This means that the objects of the same class may be suppressed as the background at one time and motivated as the detection target at another time, which is obviously unreasonable.
Furthermore, unlike 2D image data, the 3D LiDAR point cloud data in the autonomous driving scenario faces serious category imbalance. We believe that the ideal number of uniform control samples for each category is difficult to simulate the long-tailed distribution of categories in the actual situation. The setting of 2D few-shot object detection, <span id="S3.SS1.p10.4.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">i.e.</span>, the objects of both common and uncommon categories appear with the same frequency, is only an ideal situation and lacks some practical meaning for the 3D task. For this reason, instead of controlling that we enter one novel category object at a time, we choose to control that the total number of novel objects is N-way-k-shot. Specifically, for each input frame, we provide labels for all objects to be detected in it. We also allow several novel objects of different classes to appear in the same frame, and we control the total number of each novel object to be only k-shot.
This setting is proposed by considering the long-tail distribution of 3D data, <span id="S3.SS1.p10.4.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">i.e.</span>, large amount of base (common) objects and a handful of novel (uncommon) objects. Thus, we remove the restriction of base classes to make full use of a large number of base labels.</p>

<p id="S3.SS1.p11.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S3.SS1.p11.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Goal of Our Task.</span>
According to the application of autonomous driving that LiDAR data are collected on the road, and the most common categories, <em id="S3.SS1.p11.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">i.e.</em> <span id="S3.SS1.p11.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">vehicles</span> and <span id="S3.SS1.p11.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">pedestrians</span>, should be primarily concerned in the few-shot 3D object detection task for traffic safety.
Therefore, a reliable detection rate without apparent performance degradation for the common base classes is the prerequisite for pursuing the detection of rare novel categories.
Our goal for few-shot 3D object detection is to lightly train the network based on a few-shot setting per novel class to successfully detect novel objects, and maintain the performance of the base class detection.</p>

Thus, in a shot, there will be a similar number of base objects as the novel objects.
However, in the 3D LiDAR point cloud scenario, on the one hand, a frame of a point cloud may contain hundreds of objects, while only one rare object may be included. This means that the number of objects in the base class and novel class in a frame is often more than 100:1, which is a serious class imbalance.

In conclusion, for novel objects, the number is much less than that of base objects, and the space occupied by such novel objects is much smaller than that of common CAR objects. It is also likely to be submerged in a large number of other positive samples when processed by the model.
Some previous solutions <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib49" title="" class="ltx_ref">49</a>]</cite> deal with the imbalance problem by oversampling or data augmentation. Since it is short of samples for novel classes, a large number of replications will bring about over-fitting.
Thus these methods may not be suitable for few-shot 3D detection.
To overcome this problem, we design to introduce incremental learning to train the novel classes while keeping the discriminative ability for base classes.
Also, to improve our discriminability for the novel class, we design a dynamic loss function to improve the attention of the model for the novel class. The specific branch structure and design of the loss function will be described in detail in the next section.

In an image, the matrix of pixels constructs regular and dense input for 2D few-shot detection.
It is perceived as a good instance that is unobstructed and of appropriate size. When an instance has some occlusions, it brings difficulty in detection.
However, it is worth noting that the unobscured areas of the instance are still represented with dense pixels that contain some semantics for inference.
In the 3D scene, objects are formatted in a different way.
The point cloud data is irregular and very sparse.
Besides, there are also a large number of occlusions of different degrees.
The unoccluded regions of an object may merely contain a few points or even no points at all.
If there is a substantial distance between the object and the LiDAR vehicle, then the object would only contain a small number of points.
Moreover, the objects of the novel categories are not common on the road but are relatively far from the current vehicle with LiDAR equipment.
This situation also brings more difficulty in detection, regardless of the object is being obscured or not.
It is in line with common sense that, in an image, small objects are more difficult to detect compared with large objects, due to the deficiency of semantics provided by fewer pixels.
These phenomenons reveal that the few-shot 3D object detection is more challenging than the 2D task.

<div id="S4.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Inspired by the 2D few-shot detection method, TFA <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>,
we also adopt a two-stage fine-tuning approach for the detection network.
In the first stage, namely base training, we continue to use the original base class training to obtain robust detection performance on base classes, by making full use of a large number of base class labels. In contrast to TFA, our goal of the second few-shot fine-tuning stage is to detect the novel class while maintaining the effectiveness of the base class. Thus, we choose to add one branch (head) for each novel class in the multi-head module to avoid disturbing the detection heads of base classes.
Then we freeze the parameters of the baseline model and only finetune the incremental branches by using a few training data of novel classes.</p>
</div>
<div id="S4.SS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Specifically, our network utilizes CenterPoint <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite> as the baseline and VoxelNet <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite> as our backbone.
For few-shot learning, we retain the original 10 categories in the nuScenes dataset as the base classes.
We modify the head part of the network by adding new independent branches for each novel class, as shown in Fig. <a href="#S3.F2" title="Figure 2 ‣ III-B Comparison of 2D and 3D Few-Shot Object Detection ‣ III Generalized Few-Shot 3D Object Detection ‣ Generalized Few-Shot 3D Object Detection of LiDAR Point Cloud for Autonomous Driving" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>.
Each of the new branches has the same head as the base prediction branch of CenterPoint, which predicts the center position, size, orientation and velocity for the objects. Each incremental branch consists of a simple two-layer convolution, one layer of BN and one layer of ReLU. The details of the network structure can be seen in Fig. <a href="#S4.F3" title="Figure 3 ‣ IV-B Sample Adaptive Balance Loss ‣ IV Method ‣ Generalized Few-Shot 3D Object Detection of LiDAR Point Cloud for Autonomous Driving" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a>.
After the first base-training stage, the backbone has obtained a good feature extraction ability in the first stage and the base head branches are discriminative for the base classes. Thus, in the second fine-tuning phase, we keep these parts of the network unchanged. We only train the incremental branches with our few-shot training set, to ensure the prediction for the base class does not decrease during the fine-tuning phase.</p>

<div id="S4.SS1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Our fine-tuning strategy is different from TFA, which fine-tunes all head branches for both base and novel classes.

The goal is to investigate the effects of novel class detection in the case of class imbalance as much as possible.</p>
</div>
<div id="S4.SS1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Actually, we have tried to adopt the fine-tuning strategy of TFA, by simply fine-tuning all parameters in the last prediction part of the network, <span id="S4.SS1.p4.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">i.e</span>, the multi-head module. However, in our experiments, we found that simply placing the base class and novel class in the same head would lead to catastrophic forgetting in base class detection. Because the base class and novel class objects may have similar shapes, causing the network to easily confuse the two classes of objects..
Besides, we also have tried different incremental branching methods and different training strategies in the second fine-tuning stage to explore a better incremental learning method for our few-shot 3D detection task. More details could be found in Sec. V.B.</p>

<div id="S4.SS2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">During the actual fine-tuning process with a few samples, we find several challenges in the 3D scenario. 1) The scale and the number of objects in a novel class are too small compared with the large background area. This leads to a severe imbalance between the positive and the negative samples during fine-tuning. 2) During the first base-training stage, the network is apt to regard the objects of novel classes as the background if there are novel classes in the same scene. Thus, the novel classes are more inclined to be suppressed by the base-trained model. We need to correct these errors during fine-tuning.
3) Since the network is trained by many samples in base classes in the first stage, it usually generates high responses to the base classes. Thus, it is difficult to predict the novel classes by only using a few samples for fine-tuning, especially when the object of the base category is similar to the novel category.
</p>

<div id="S4.SS2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">To overcome the aforementioned challenges, we propose a novel sample adaptive balance loss, which is inspired by the focal loss <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib50" title="" class="ltx_ref">50</a>]</cite>.
However, if we simply follow the original solution for 2D detection, there will be a relatively high weight of the foreground compared to the background.
There may be a few novel class objects in the point cloud scenes while there are many objects of other classes around, and some negative samples with high response will occur during the detection process.
The small number of high-scored negative samples will be obliterated by a large number of low-scored negative samples.
Therefore, it is necessary to emphasize these difficult samples with a reasonable higher weight in 3D LiDAR point cloud scenes.
We design a new loss function to solve the conspicuous imbalance between positive and negative samples.</p>

The first stage of training is conducted on 10 base classes according to the setting of the original 3D object detection task.
We use a one-cycle learning rate variation with a maximum learning rate of 1e-3 and a minimum learning rate of 1e-4, for a total of 20 epochs. The batch size is set to 4, and the weight decay in the Adam optimizer is set to 0.01.
When getting a reliable detector, the backbone of the detector is responsible for extracting underlying feature embeddings, and the last few layers are related to the high-level discriminative semantics for classification.
As a result, for the novel classes, we directly exploit the feature extraction part of the network and keep the parameters of <math id="S5.SS1.p1.4.m4.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\theta_{E}" display="inline"><semantics id="S5.SS1.p1.4.m4.1a"><msub id="S5.SS1.p1.4.m4.1.1" xref="S5.SS1.p1.4.m4.1.1.cmml"><mi id="S5.SS1.p1.4.m4.1.1.2" xref="S5.SS1.p1.4.m4.1.1.2.cmml">θ</mi><mi id="S5.SS1.p1.4.m4.1.1.3" xref="S5.SS1.p1.4.m4.1.1.3.cmml">E</mi></msub><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S5.SS1.p1.4.m4.1b"><apply id="S5.SS1.p1.4.m4.1.1.cmml" xref="S5.SS1.p1.4.m4.1.1"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S5.SS1.p1.4.m4.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S5.SS1.p1.4.m4.1.1">subscript</csymbol><ci id="S5.SS1.p1.4.m4.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S5.SS1.p1.4.m4.1.1.2">𝜃</ci><ci id="S5.SS1.p1.4.m4.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S5.SS1.p1.4.m4.1.1.3">𝐸</ci></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S5.SS1.p1.4.m4.1c">\theta_{E}</annotation></semantics></math>.
We conduct experiments by adopting different training strategies on the baseline obtained in the first training stage.
In the second stage of training, the novel classes are trained on our constructed few-shot 3D point cloud training set.
For each novel category, we add a head branch to predict objects in that category.
In the second stage of training, the learning rate is set to one-tenth of the first stage, with training 80 epochs.
We augment the novel class with GT-AUG <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite> strategy. That is, if there are less than two objects of a novel class in each input, we will copy some sample data and add them to the input.
The objects of all categories are filtered according to the number of points, whose minimum number is set to 5 per object.

We keep the original settings of predicting at most 500 boxes for a whole point cloud scene.
Setting 1 denotes the baseline without fine-tuning.
We evaluate the original network on our validation set to acquire the detection results of the base class when new classes are not introduced.
In this way, we can further compare the degree of forgetting of the base class by this network after the introduction of novel class detection.
The current detection metrics only consider 10 significant classes in the detection task.
We adapt the evaluation metric of base classes and novel classes independently and set the detection range for each novel class.
While keeping the detection distance for the base class the same, we established different detection ranges for different classes of objects: 50m for police vehicles, 40m for strollers, and 30m for the other two novel classes.
Our evaluation criteria are divided into three parts. One is the mean average precision(mAP) of all base class objects, denoted as bmAP, to measure how well we detect common classes. One is the mAP of all novel objects, denoted as nmAP, to show how well we are detecting the novel objects. The last one is the mAP of all categories, which is used to represent the average detection effect, denoted as cmAP.</p>

<p id="S5.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Compared with the high-quality data of common objects, we first evaluate the data quality of novel objects. And we explore the detection ability of CenterPoint model for novel objects under the existing data conditions without considering the detection effect of Base objects.
Setting 2 represents the parameters of the whole network that are released to update in the second stage.
This setting is to explore the current performance of the network for detecting novel class objects, which are more difficult to detect, without considering the catastrophic forgetting of the base class. It is equivalent to finding the upper limit of our detection performance for the novel class without accounting for the loss of detection effectiveness of the base class.
In setting 3, we freeze the base-class branches and update the other components of the network.
Training that only considers the detection of novel class objects leads to the extraction of features in the feature extraction section that are more biased towards novel class objects and suppress base class objects.</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.SS2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">As we pursue a fast generalization to a few training samples, the base class will have a serious performance degradation due to the additional new classes of objects, which is unwanted in the autonomous driving scenario.
It can be noticed that settings 2 and 3 bring a significant decrease in predicting the base class, as the bmAP metrics drop from 73.3% to 51.4% and 13.4%, respectively (blue characters). Even if they obtain higher nmAP scores, they cannot be adopted in real-life scenarios.
At the same time, we can also see that the best result achieved by the existing model for the novel class without considering the base is only 12.8%, which can be approximated as the upper limit of detection we can achieve in the case of poor quality of the novel class data.
Besides, it reveals that the feature extractor/RPN structure is not suitable to fine-tune in learning few-shot novel classes, since they are apt to provide satisfying features to guarantee the prediction accuracy for novel classes while forgetting the base classes.</p>

In order to further preserve the detection effect of the base class, we do not change any step of the whole model for base class detection, but only add the novel branch to it and train the head part of the base class and novel class, and control the gradient back-propagation of the novel class branch will not affect the features processed by the base class.
Setting 7 merely updates the novel branches.
The purpose of this is to preserve the detection effect of the base class to the extreme so that the second stage of training is only for the novel branch.</p>

This shows that keeping the feature extraction part of the model unchanged can effectively retain the very good feature extraction capability of the original model.
From setting 6 and 7 we found that keeping the shared convolution part of all branches before going to the head of each class preserves the feature extraction capability of the original network more effectively. Since the feature extraction part of the model is not changed, the effect of our base class is further preserved.
Furthermore, we discover that merely updating the novel-class branches <math id="S5.SS3.p2.2.m2.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\theta_{N}" display="inline"><semantics id="S5.SS3.p2.2.m2.1a"><msub id="S5.SS3.p2.2.m2.1.1" xref="S5.SS3.p2.2.m2.1.1.cmml"><mi id="S5.SS3.p2.2.m2.1.1.2" xref="S5.SS3.p2.2.m2.1.1.2.cmml">θ</mi><mi id="S5.SS3.p2.2.m2.1.1.3" xref="S5.SS3.p2.2.m2.1.1.3.cmml">N</mi></msub><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S5.SS3.p2.2.m2.1b"><apply id="S5.SS3.p2.2.m2.1.1.cmml" xref="S5.SS3.p2.2.m2.1.1"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S5.SS3.p2.2.m2.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S5.SS3.p2.2.m2.1.1">subscript</csymbol><ci id="S5.SS3.p2.2.m2.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S5.SS3.p2.2.m2.1.1.2">𝜃</ci><ci id="S5.SS3.p2.2.m2.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S5.SS3.p2.2.m2.1.1.3">𝑁</ci></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S5.SS3.p2.2.m2.1c">\theta_{N}</annotation></semantics></math> achieves the best performance on both the base and the novel classes (bmAP reaches 70.8% and nmAP is 5.9%).
It is worth studying that in setting 7, we neither modified the head of the base class nor controlled the feature extraction part as before. Theoretically, the detection effect of the base class should be similar to the original model, but from the results, we found that 0.708 still has a 3% decrease compared to 0.733.
In order to investigate the reason for this part, we analyzed the experimental results and found that in the original case, the model would classify some of the background and base class objects that contain fewer points as base class objects, but now some novel class objects also appear in the classification options that contain fewer points, and the interference of these cases leads to a slight decrease in the detection effect of the base class.</p>

<p id="S5.SS5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The head part of the network categorized all classes into separate detection branches as individual detection tasks in real-world detection procedures. For the novel classes, we also investigated the impact of different categorization methods on the detection results.
In conventional 3D object detection on the point cloud, the principles lie in the size, shape and number of the object.
The original 10 base classes in nuScenes are divided into different tasks.
Accordingly, we first analyze the novel classes and add them to the original tasks based on the size, shape, and sample size of each category (Tab. <a href="#S5.T4" title="TABLE IV ‣ V-D Alleviating sample imbalance ‣ V Experiments ‣ Generalized Few-Shot 3D Object Detection of LiDAR Point Cloud for Autonomous Driving" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">IV</span></a> #1).
Moreover, we do not limit adding to or changing the commonly used splits, but also try to train all novel classes in a new task, by utilizing a unified branch (Tab. <a href="#S5.T4" title="TABLE IV ‣ V-D Alleviating sample imbalance ‣ V Experiments ‣ Generalized Few-Shot 3D Object Detection of LiDAR Point Cloud for Autonomous Driving" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">IV</span></a> #2).
In order to pursue a more straightforward extension to new categories of objects, we refer to some settings of incremental learning and treat each category as a separate task branch to predict (Tab. <a href="#S5.T4" title="TABLE IV ‣ V-D Alleviating sample imbalance ‣ V Experiments ‣ Generalized Few-Shot 3D Object Detection of LiDAR Point Cloud for Autonomous Driving" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">IV</span></a> #3).
The experimental results are shown in Tab. <a href="#S5.T4" title="TABLE IV ‣ V-D Alleviating sample imbalance ‣ V Experiments ‣ Generalized Few-Shot 3D Object Detection of LiDAR Point Cloud for Autonomous Driving" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">IV</span></a>.
As we can see, the incremental branch is best suitable for the task set.</p>

<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Our work is the first attempt to explore few-shot 3D object detection of LiDAR point cloud data for autonomous driving scenarios to detect additional classes. To address the issue that real-world datasets are often long-tail distributed, we achieve object detection for new data categories by simply training on incremental branches with only a small number of samples. We also propose a new loss, namely the SAB loss, to improve the detection performance of novel classes. Although our work achieved significant improvements in detecting 3D point clouds with little training data, there is still a long way to go for few-shot 3D object detection of the point cloud. Many challenging problems are still unsolved which we will further discuss in our future work.</p>
