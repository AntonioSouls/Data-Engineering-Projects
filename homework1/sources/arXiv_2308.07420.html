<p id="id2.id1" class="ltx_p">Path planning in obstacle-dense environments is a key challenge in robotics, and depends on inferring scene attributes and associated uncertainties. We present a multiple-hypothesis path planner designed to navigate complex environments using obstacle detections. Path hypotheses are generated by reasoning about uncertainty and range, as initial detections are typically at far ranges with high uncertainty, before subsequent detections reduce this uncertainty. Given estimated obstacles, we build a graph of pairwise connections between objects based on the probability that the robot can safely pass between the pair. The graph is updated in real time and pruned of unsafe paths, providing probabilistic safety guarantees. The planner generates path hypotheses over this graph, then trades between safety and path length to intelligently optimize the best route. We evaluate our planner on randomly generated simulated forests, and find that in the most challenging environments, it increases the navigation success rate over an A* baseline from 20% to 75%. Results indicate that the use of evolving, range-based uncertainty and multiple hypotheses are critical for navigating dense environments.</p>

<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Autonomous navigation in unknown, unstructured, and obstacle-dense environments requires a robot to recognize obstacles and plan a safe path around them, typically by using a 3D sensor such as a stereo camera or lidar. This problem becomes much more challenging as the desired navigation speed and complexity of the environment increase. The further ahead the robot can robustly perceive and react to upcoming obstacles, the more safely it will be able to navigate through increasingly challenging and obstacle-dense environments.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">However, 3D sensors used in robotics are often affected by measurement errors that increase with distance from the sensor. Stereo camera depth errors grow quadratically with range, due to disparity estimation errors <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>. Lidar sensors, while more precise, return very sparse points at longer ranges.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Current pipelines for autonomous navigation in unknown environments plan iteratively, by constructing a map of the robot’s immediate surroundings (often as a 3D occupancy grid), optimizing a path to a global goal in this map, then recursively updating the local map and planned trajectory as the robot moves towards the goal and obtains new sensor measurements <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>. These methods have demonstrated significant successes in autonomous path planning. However, due to increasing 3D sensor noise with range, existing methods typically plan only in a short range near the robot, where sensor noise is minimal and reliable map construction is possible. The robot discards noisier sensor measurements beyond this range entirely, ultimately limiting the robot’s ability to quickly and effectively traverse complex environments.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Ryll <span id="S1.p4.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite> point out this constrained perception horizon as a key limitation on the speed of safe autonomous navigation in agile unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) flight. With no knowledge of the environment past the short, minimal-noise sensor range, the robot must plan conservatively, always ready to come to a stop at the boundary of this sensor range in case new obstacles appear. Ideally, the robot should be able to reason about potential obstacles at far ranges, enabling preemptive avoidance of obstacle-dense areas.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Long-range sensor measurements, while noisy, still contain usable information for recognizing obstacles. Works such as <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>, and <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite> presented planning methods that use camera image semantics to augment short range 3D sensor measurements. Recent works in 3D object detection <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite> have demonstrated accurate object detection at longer ranges than reliable occupancy grid mapping is typically possible. These methods use machine learning to recognize patterns in 3D point clouds and detect objects even within noisy sensor data.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">These object detectors provide a promising way to extend the amount of actionable information available to a robot, by enabling longer-range obstacle recognition. However, object detections still contain errors in measuring obstacle positions and sizes, as shown previously in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>. The robot must therefore reason about this sensing uncertainty in the path planning algorithm, in order to effectively use these object detections.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p7" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p7.1" class="ltx_p">As illustrated in Figure <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ I Introduction ‣ Multiple-Hypothesis Path Planning with Uncertain Object Detections" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>, failing to consider this uncertainty can result in unsafe planned paths, while using uncertainty naively can result in inefficient planning. In this paper, we present a multiple-hypothesis planner which uses uncertain object detections to help the robot navigate to its goal, while considering the length and safety of multiple candidate paths to determine the overall best path to the goal.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p8" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p8.1" class="ltx_p">Our work is motivated by navigation through a forest while avoiding tree trunks, previously studied in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>, and <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>. To model this problem, we consider a robot navigating through an environment densely populated with obstacles of a single class, but with different sizes and locations, that can be detected with noise that varies with range. We first estimate the positions and sizes of obstacles using these noisy object detections. We then construct a graph representation of the scene based on pairwise connections between obstacles, which stores the probability that the robot can safely navigate between each pair of nearby obstacles in the world. This graph can be updated in real-time based on new measurements, and pruned if edges do not provide safe paths, thus providing probabilistic guarantees. Using this probabilistic graph, we plan multiple path hypotheses between pairs of obstacles to the navigation goal. The planner then intelligently optimizes the best route to the goal by trading off between safety and expected path length.</p>

<div id="S2.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Traditionally, path planning methods take as input a known map of the robot’s surroundings, then use this map to plan a collision-free path to a given goal state. Robot path planning methods include sampling-based approaches such as rapidly-exploring random trees (RRTs) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>, as well as minimum cost search methods, often based on the A* algorithm <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>. Hybrid A* <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>, <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite> extends this algorithm by associating each discrete step of the A* search with a continuous vehicle state, ensuring that the final path is valid with respect to the robot kinematics.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In practice, a robot generally lacks a detailed map of the environment in advance and must construct one in real time using its onboard sensors. Therefore, typical path planning pipelines work iteratively, re-planning as the robot traverses the environment and updates its map with new sensor measurements. A commonly used map structure is a binary 3D occupancy grid, where cells are classified as either occupied or unoccupied. These occupancy grids can be constructed using 3D sensors such as stereo cameras <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite> or lidar <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>. These works have significantly advanced the state of the art in 3D autonomous path planning, implementing the iterative re-planning approach on 3D grids.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">A key limiting factor on autonomous navigation is the maximum perception horizon of the robot’s sensors <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>. At long ranges, sensor noise grows significantly, with stereo cameras suffering from a quadratic increase in depth estimation error with range <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>, and lidar point measurements becoming sparse. Longer range planning carries computational costs as well; for example, the cost to maintain a 3D occupancy grid grows cubically with the size of the grid, forcing size- and weight-constrained robots to use a smaller grid that does not make use of all available sensor information <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Planning only at short range limits the speed of safe robotic navigation, as the robot must move slowly enough to be able to come to a stop at the boundary of the perceived space, in case new obstacles are detected. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite> address this issue by planning in the unknown space, allowing faster flight while maintaining a safe backup trajectory that exists entirely in the nearer-range known space. However, the planner in this work assumes the unknown space to always be free. Ideally, a robot should be able to reason about uncertainty in noisier, longer-range sensor measurements, and plan efficient paths that also account for the imperfect knowledge of distant regions.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Additionally, complex and cluttered environments make efficient and agile planning especially difficult.

However, the map model used in that work is based on a 3D occupancy grid, whose typical resolutions (15-30 cm, to enable real-time processing) might preclude the existence of safe paths in dense environments. The present work fills this gap.</p>

<p id="S2.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Robotics researchers have begun using machine learning-based perception to enable robots to more meaningfully understand their surroundings. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite>, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite>, and <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite> use 2D bounding box object detections as measurements for landmark-based simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). In contrast to previous SLAM methods, which heuristically pick out landmarks from 2D image pixels or 3D point cloud scans, the object detector enables the robot to reason at a higher level, recognizing objects of interest, estimating their positions and sizes, and localizing with respect to them.</p>

<p id="S2.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Researchers have also used learned perception to augment robotic path planning and navigation. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite> use a Bayesian neural network to identify potentially unsafe regions in stereo images (for example, distinguishing muddy terrain from a paved sidewalk), then use this information to plan safe paths that also decrease the robot’s uncertainty about its surroundings, using a next-best view planning approach. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite> train a neural network to predict drivable versus unsafe terrain from sparse lidar scans. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite> extend A* search with semantic weights applied to the graph edges.

<p id="S2.SS2.p4.1" class="ltx_p">One challenge with stereo camera 3D object detection is the fact that due to significant noise, long-range stereo point clouds cannot be annotated with 3D bounding boxes in a reliable and unbiased way.

Since at a high level, a path through the forest can be thought of as a series of obstacle pairs between which the robot should pass, we can therefore equivalently define a path by a series of Delaunay triangulation cells. In the following sections of this paper, we define a graph structure over the Delaunay cells, over which we can search in order to determine possible paths to the goal.</p>

At short range, we do not place graph vertices on unsafe Delaunay cell faces, as demonstrated in Figure <a href="#S4.F5" title="Figure 5 ‣ IV-B Navigation graph construction ‣ IV Multiple-hypothesis planning under uncertainty ‣ Multiple-Hypothesis Path Planning with Uncertain Object Detections" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5</span></a>.e). When planning around close-by obstacles, the robot may not have enough time to collect more measurements and update its estimates of these obstacles. Therefore, the robot should not risk a crash by passing between unsafe obstacle pairs in the short range.</p>

<div id="S4.SS2.SSS4.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS2.SSS4.p3.1" class="ltx_p">In contrast, path planning between uncertain long-range obstacles should take into account the fact that the robot will have time to safely collect additional sensor information, and update its estimate of these obstacles before closely approaching them. Preventing the robot from planning between uncertain, far-off obstacles will likely lead to excessively conservative planning behavior in obstacle-dense environments. During the graph construction, we therefore place navigation graph vertices on Delaunay cell faces between unsafe long-range obstacles, recognizing that as the robot receives more detections, some of these uncertain vertices will resolve to safe and viable navigation paths. The multiple-hypothesis planner we introduce in the next section of this paper intelligently considers multiple of these candidate paths, making use of uncertain information from the obstacle estimates.</p>

<p id="S4.SS2.SSS4.p4.1" class="ltx_p">We place multiple vertices on long Delaunay cell faces which are determined to be very safe. These cell faces correspond to very wide gaps between obstacles, where the overall path distance may change significantly depending on whether the robot decides to pass nearby one of the obstacles or the other. Placing multiple vertices on these cell faces therefore allows the graph search to better approximate the geometric length of paths.</p>

<p id="S5.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We evaluate our planner in a large-scale experimental trial, using randomly generated simulated forest environments. We vary the complexity of the simulated forests, in terms of the overall density of trees and their distribution, in order to test our hypothesis that our probabilistic planner should enable safer navigation in more complex and obstacle-dense environments.</p>

<p id="S5.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">We generate our forests by specifying a desired tree density per area, then sampling the total number of trees in the environment according to the Poisson distribution as in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite>. Tree sizes are uniformly distributed in a defined range, and we sample trees such that they do not overlap with each other. We first conduct simulations in forest environments of varying densities, where tree positions are uniformly sampled across the forest bounds. Noting that through areas of uniformly distributed trees, the best path through the forest mostly involves driving in a straight line to the goal with only small deviations, we then conduct an additional experiment in the more challenging case of forests containing three Gaussian-distributed clusters of trees (along with additional uniformly distributed obstacles), which lie directly between the robot and its goal. The robot generally cannot safely pass through these regions, so identifying and avoiding them preemptively is the most efficient way to reach the goal.

The planner stops most often in the high density forests, with the 5-hypothesis planner succeeding 11 times, stopping 7 times, and crashing 2 times in the high density forests.

We note that depending on the application, a robot stopping when unable to find a path is likely more desirable than crashing into an obstacle.

<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we presented a method for path planning through complex, obstacle-dense environments using noisy object detections, motivated by the use of machine learning-based object detectors to enable robots to plan around distant obstacles. Our approach constructs a probabilistic graph representation of obstacles; we then plan multiple candidate paths through the graph, accounting for path safety and expected distance to optimize the best route to the goal. Simulation experiments in generated forest environments demonstrated that our multiple hypothesis planner enables a differential drive robot to reach its goal much more safely in complex, obstacle-dense forests as compared to a baseline global planner.</p>
</div>
<div id="S6.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Our graph representation provides a probabilistic framework that could be extended with other sources of uncertain information. In particular, the evaluation metric for the multiple path hypotheses is a promising area for future improvement, building upon the current path cost function based on safety and distance-to-goal. Including information gain as a weight in the path evaluation, as in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>, would encourage the robot to follow paths that allow it to view previously unobserved regions of the environment, or to approach uncertain obstacles in order to improve its estimate certainty by collecting additional measurements. Image semantics are another promising source of information <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>, and could be used to weight candidate paths by recognizing obstacle-dense regions from long range using semantic masks.</p>
