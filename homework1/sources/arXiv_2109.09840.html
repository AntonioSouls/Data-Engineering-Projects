<p id="id12.id1" class="ltx_p">Shape and pose estimation is a critical perception problem for a self-driving car to fully understand its surrounding environment. One fundamental challenge in solving this problem is the incomplete sensor signal (e.g., LiDAR scans), especially for faraway or occluded objects.
In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm to address this challenge, which explicitly leverages the sensor signal captured over consecutive time: the consecutive signals can provide more information about an object, including different viewpoints and its motion. By encoding the consecutive signals via a recurrent neural network, not only our algorithm improves the shape and pose estimates, but also produces a labeling tool that can benefit other tasks in autonomous driving research. Specifically, building upon our algorithm, we propose a novel pipeline to automatically annotate high-quality labels for amodal segmentation on images, which are hard and laborious to annotate manually. Our code and data will be made publicly available.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">A self-driving car must perceive its environment, identify other traffic participants (e.g., vehicles and pedestrians), and importantly, estimate their shapes and poses in order to plan and act safely.
One of the fundamental challenges for these problems is the sensor signal: a LiDAR scan may only capture one partial view of an object, making shape and pose estimation an ill-posed problem.
Many existing approaches address this challenge by
training a neural network to encode prior knowledge of complete object shapes <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>. While showing promising results, these approaches are still highly sensitive to the quality of input signals.
Specifically, the accuracy of shape and pose estimation drastically drops for faraway or heavily occluded objects whose signals are sparse and limited.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we propose to address this challenge by explicitly leveraging consecutive LiDAR scans: we find that existing methods process each LiDAR scan independently, even though the same object may appear consecutively over time.
We argue that consecutive LiDAR scans are crucial for high-quality pose and shape estimation.
First, while an object may be partially or sparsely observed at each time step, the observations can collectively render a more complete shape over time. Second, traffic participants like vehicles usually move in relatively constrained ways such that temporal information can help correct unreliable pose estimates, as evidenced by the improvement of video-based object detection <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite> and object tracking <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite> over frame-wise detection. Third, for objects that are rarely seen in the past (i.e., in the training data), the observation over time essentially offers extra data to adapt the algorithm for improved estimation.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">We propose a novel learning-based approach for joint shape and pose estimation that explicitly takes advantage of the consecutive LiDAR scans. Given a sequence of point cloud segments that coarsely captures a single object<span id="footnote1" class="ltx_note ltx_role_footnote"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">1</sup><span class="ltx_note_outer"><span class="ltx_note_content"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">1</sup><span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_note">1</span>Point cloud segments of individual objects can be extracted from LiDAR scenes through 3D instance segmentation, 3D object detection, or clustering, followed by tracking and data association over time.</span></span></span> (specifically, vehicles in this paper), we propose to fuse the newly extracted features from the current point cloud segment with those from the past via a recurrent neural network <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>. Leveraging past measurements provides additional information, especially for estimating the complete shape.
In addition, the network can internally learn a motion and behavioral model that is beneficial for pose estimation. We demonstrate that our approach in using consecutive LiDAR scans improves the accuracy of shape and pose estimates through validation on both simulated and real datasets.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Besides improving the shape and pose estimation along with other downstream tasks <em id="S1.p4.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">online</em>, our sequential approach can also benefit other autonomous driving tasks <em id="S1.p4.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">offline</em>.
Specifically, for this paper, we propose to apply the approach to automatically annotate labels for the task of amodal instance segmentation of images, a task aiming to segment the full (amodal) masks of objects irrespective of potential occlusions  <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>. This is particularly important in autonomous driving, where dense traffic and adverse conditions (e.g., snow, rain, night) may obfuscate objects.
One bottleneck of this research, aside from the algorithm design, is the lack of large-scale datasets annotated with ground-truth amodal masks.
Concretely, manual annotation of amodal masks is laborious and heavily relies on the subjective intuition of the occluded objects’ shape by the annotator, making it hard to maintain consistency and reliability of the labels.
Fortunately, autonomous driving data is typically collected in sequence, and usually includes both image and LiDAR information.
Thus, we leverage the point cloud sequence and our sequential algorithm to estimate the complete 3D object shapes at each time frame, these 3D shape results are then projected onto the corresponding image to obtain the amodal masks. The occlusion ordering can be immediately obtained from depth information. Overall, our <span id="S1.p4.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">automatic</span> labeling pipeline helps to resolve the ambiguity in manually annotating amodal masks from just a single image.</p>

<div id="S2.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Previous works have proposed different methods and representations in estimating vehicles’ shapes from LiDAR observations for fine-grained understanding beyond simple bounding boxes <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>. However, these works obtain shape estimates only for parts of vehicles that have been previously seen, often resulting in incomplete shape estimates. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite> predict the complete shape of an object from an image through a shape matching process, i.e., representing the object shape as a combination of shape basis, requiring an extensive CAD model library. While 2D image projections of the resulting shape estimates may be accurate, RGB-based methods lack the 3D depth spatial information that is crucial to produce accurate shape estimates in 3D space. As LiDAR sensor is commonly available in autonomous driving setup, 3D point cloud information can be utilized for more accurate shape and pose predictions.</p>

<div id="S2.SS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Point cloud completion aims to predict the complete shape of an object given an incomplete point cloud measurement. Point Completion Network (PCN) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>, one of the pioneers for learning-based shape completion, proposes a simple encoder-decoder shape completion network. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite> designs a new decoder architecture that generates point cloud based on a hierarchical tree structure. More recently, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite> proposes a completion method that directly predicts the missing point cloud and appends it to the point cloud input.
However, they all assume well-aligned, canonical point cloud inputs, which are hard to obtain for actual sensor data. Thus, these methods require a pose estimation and a point cloud alignment to a canonical pose as preprocessing steps to operate on real-world data. Consequently, the shape estimation is subject to errors from the pose estimation.
To address this issue, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite> proposes a network that jointly estimates the pose and complete shape of vehicles, sharing information between the two tasks. Our work builds upon these efforts. However, unlike existing works which make an independent estimate for each point cloud input, our method fuses information over time to produce more accurate shape and pose estimates.</p>

<div id="S2.SS2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Pose estimation in autonomous driving refers to inferring the location and orientation of an object. Many detection and tracking algorithms represent vehicles by bounding boxes (parameterized by sizes, orientations, and center locations) and perform traditional filtering, such as the Kalman filter, to fuse new measurements with prior beliefs <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>. However, representing vehicles by bounding boxes eliminates detailed shape information that can facilitate accurate and robust tracking.
To make full use of shape information, some trackers <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite> apply Iterative Closest Point (ICP) to align point cloud measurements. However, they heavily rely on good initialization and often get stuck in local minima. As opposed to ICP, Annealed Dynamic Histogram (ADH) tracker <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite> globally explores the state space to find the best Markovian alignment between measurements. However, ADH scores the point cloud alignment only based on the latest two measurements. Thus, ADH lacks robustness when the point cloud is sparse, or the viewpoint changes rapidly. Learning-based approaches <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>, <a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>, <a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>, <a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite> benefit from curated training data and can learn to be robust against occlusions and inferior sensor data. However, most of these approaches operate separately on individual frames and do not utilize past information along tracks.</p>

<div id="S2.SS3.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Labeling amodal masks is commonly deemed as a subjective and ill-posed problem, as it involves the annotators’ intuition to predict the occluded masks. Thus, it requires rigorous guidelines and control to ensure the consistency and quality of the labels.
For example, the KINS dataset <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite> provides manually annotated amodal mask labels on the autonomous driving KITTI object detection data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite>. To obtain high-quality labels, the data is repetitively labeled six times by three different annotators. This shows the difficulty of amodal mask labeling.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS3.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS3.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Several attempts have been made to automate the amodal mask label generation. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite> intentionally introduces occlusion to the image by overlaying unoccluded instances with other object masks. The new overlaid image is used as the input data, while the original unoccluded masks serve as the amodal mask labels. While this can efficiently provide accurate amodal mask labels, the generated images may not look realistic or reflect a realistic occlusion relationship in the real world. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite> aligns 3D CAD models from PASCAL 3D+ dataset <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite> to the target instances in PASCAL VOC <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite> images and projects the model onto the image frames to acquire the labels.

<div id="S4.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We extend our sequential shape and pose estimation algorithm in point clouds
to automatic amodal segmentation labeling in images, building on the following key observation.
An object instance commonly appears in multiple frames, as driving data is collected in a continuous sequence. Thus, a part of an amodal mask occluded in one frame may be visible in other frames. If we can fuse the information from multiple frames, we can produce amodal masks that are consistent across time frames.
One naive way is to fuse 2D inmodal masks in the image space — 2D inmodal masks are easier to annotate or can be obtained from existing segmentation algorithms like Mask-RCNN <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib44" title="" class="ltx_ref">44</a>]</cite>. This method, however, has several challenges. First, an object’s 2D size and shape vary across frames depending on its relative pose to the camera. Second, the mask shape is also influenced by the object’s 3D orientation, a piece of information that is missing in 2D. Third, while multiple frames provide extra information about an object, some parts may never be seen in any frames.</p>
</div>
<div id="S4.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.p2.1" class="ltx_p">To solve these issues, we propose to fuse the information over time in 3D by taking advantage of 1) the 3D LiDAR signal that is commonly available in the autonomous driving configuration, and 2) our learned network for shape completion that encodes the prior of complete shapes from training data.
We feed the point cloud sequence into our sequential point completion network in order to obtain the full amodal information of the object. The complete point cloud is then projected to the image space and post-processed to get an alpha shape as the amodal mask label. Finally, the occlusion ordering is reasoned from depth information.</p>
</div>
<div id="S4.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.p3.1" class="ltx_p">We present two different scenarios where our automatic labeling pipeline can be used. The first assumes the availability of 3D bounding box ground truth and association, which are typically available on a public driving dataset, on the data to be labeled. In this case, the 3D bounding boxes are used to segment the point cloud objects to get a sequence of partial point cloud objects containing only the target vehicle. Given a segmented point cloud sequence and ground truth transformations, one can simply accumulate these segmented point clouds using the ground truth transformations and use the symmetrical property of vehicles to mirror the point cloud with respect to its heading axis in order to obtain the amodal shape information. However, this may still result in incomplete amodal information for many cases, as will be shown in <a href="#S5.SS3" title="V-C Automatic Labeling of Amodal Segmentation on KITTI ‣ V Experiments ‣ Sequential Joint Shape and Pose Estimation of Vehicles with Application to Automatic Amodal Segmentation Labeling" class="ltx_ref ltx_refmacro_autoref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">subsection <span class="ltx_text">V-C</span></span></a>. So instead, we leverage our sequential point completion network to fuse and complete the amodal information. As our goal is labeling, we can train and evaluate the network on the same dataset.</p>
</div>
<div id="S4.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.p4.1" class="ltx_p">In the second scenario, we handle situations where 3D bounding box labels are unavailable. In this case, we deploy a pretrained Mask-RCNN <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib44" title="" class="ltx_ref">44</a>]</cite> inmodal instance segmentation and LDLS <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>]</cite> (a 2D to 3D label diffusion framework) to segment the point cloud, followed by data association.

Note that even after the LiDAR point clouds are accumulated and mirrored, the developed shape reference may still be non-ideal (e.g., displaying noise, inaccuracy, incompleteness, and non-uniform point density), as it is built from measurements.
As EMD is highly sensitive to these properties, evaluating EMD against such point cloud reference is not meaningful. Thus, we do not report the EMD for Argoverse evaluation.</p>

GT-Accumulation is our method of accumulating and mirroring partial point cloud sequences. SC-GT refers to our improvement of GT-Accumulation by utilizing our sequential completion. Finally, SC-MRCNN refers to sequential completion using Mask-RCNN <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib44" title="" class="ltx_ref">44</a>]</cite> and label diffusion when 3D ground truth bounding boxes are unavailable.</p>

<div id="S5.SS3.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.SS3.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In all three cases (with and without 3D bounding box labels), our proposed labeling approaches achieve comparable mIoU consistency to human-level performance, i.e., KINS cross-annotators consistency. In the case where 3D ground truth bounding boxes are available, running through sequential completion (SC-GT) yields less missing instance match than just accumulating and mirroring (GT-Accumulation). It is important to note that we compare our generated labels to the manually annotated KINS labels and not to the actual amodal mask ground truth that is practically unavailable. The KINS label itself has some noise, i.e., its internal consistency across different annotators is <span class="ltx_ref ltx_nolink ltx_ref_self">~</span>0.8. Thus, achieving a higher mIoU than that does not necessarily imply a better quality mask.</p>

Specifically, note the area inside the red boxes. We observe cases where merely accumulating and mirroring (GT-Accumulation) is not enough to cover the complete amodal information. Additionally, GT-Accumulation is prone to error or noise in the point cloud, as shown in the white car inside the red box in <a href="#S5.F4" title="Figure 4 ‣ V-B1 Results on Synthetic Dataset ‣ V-B Shape and Pose Estimation ‣ V Experiments ‣ Sequential Joint Shape and Pose Estimation of Vehicles with Application to Automatic Amodal Segmentation Labeling" class="ltx_ref ltx_refmacro_autoref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">Figure 4</span></a> top left.

<p id="S5.SS3.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Finally, in the absence of 3D ground truth bounding boxes, we can not perform our accumulation and mirroring method (GT-Accumulation). But our sequential completion network (SC-MRCNN) still provides comparable quality masks to human-annotated labels despite the absence of any labels. Although as expected, the performance of SC-MRCNN is slightly worse than SC-GT. This is because segmenting out point cloud using Mask-RCNN and LDLS is not as accurate as using human-annotated 3D ground truth bounding boxes. Additionally, due to the absence of 3D ground truth bounding boxes, the sequential completion network in SC-MRCNN is trained on the synthetic data, which introduces some domain adaptation gap when applied to the KITTI data.</p>

<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We propose a learning-based approach for joint point completion and pose estimation of vehicles from LiDAR point cloud measurements. Uniquely, our method explicitly leverages the temporal information of tracks. We evaluate our method on synthetic and real-world datasets, showing better performance in both shape and pose estimation tasks against the baseline approach. We demonstrate that properly fusing extra temporal information benefits shape and pose estimation. Finally, we propose a novel automatic amodal labeling pipeline using our sequential completion network.
We evaluate our automatic amodal labeling pipeline and demonstrate comparable quality to human annotations.</p>
