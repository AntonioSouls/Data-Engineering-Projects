<p id="id9.id1" class="ltx_p">Noise has always been nonnegligible trouble in object detection by creating confusion in model reasoning, thereby reducing the informativeness of the data. It can lead to inaccurate recognition due to the shift in the observed pattern, that requires a robust generalization of the models. To implement a general vision model, we need to develop deep learning models that can adaptively select valid information from multi-modal data. This is mainly based on two reasons. Multi-modal learning can break through the inherent defects of single-modal data, and adaptive information selection can reduce chaos in multi-modal data. To tackle this problem, we propose a universal uncertainty-aware multi-modal fusion model. It adopts a multi-pipeline loosely coupled architecture to combine the features and results from point clouds and images. To quantify the correlation in multi-modal information, we model the uncertainty, as the inverse of data information, in different modalities and embed it in the bounding box generation. In this way, our model reduces the randomness in fusion and generates reliable output. Moreover, we conducted a completed investigation on the KITTI 2D object detection dataset and its derived dirty data. Our fusion model is proven to resist severe noise interference like Gaussian, motion blur, and frost, with only slight degradation. The experiment results demonstrate the benefits of our adaptive fusion. Our analysis on the robustness of multi-modal fusion will provide further insights for future research.</p>

<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Recent success in deep learning has contributed much to computer vision, such as semantic segmentation, object detection, and object tracking. However, for some application areas like autonomous driving, there are more requirements for vision models<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. Though current models can perform well on most tasks, they have a limitation on dirty data and fail to meet the practical standard of industrial application<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>. For instance, when a self-driving vehicle (SDV) runs on the road, complex traffic scenarios, unpredictable weather conditions, and potential sensor failure can lead to pattern shifts and inaccurate object recognition. Therefore, robustness and generalization are gradually brought into focus in model development. In the following, we explain why multi-modal learning and adaptive selection of informative data are important for improving model generalization.</p>

<figcaption class="ltx_caption ltx_centering"><span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_figure">Figure 1: </span>Illustration of the measurement noise in perception models. Tests on datasets take fixed data points as input and generate statistical conclusions. While in practical application, various environment and hardware conditions produce potential noise in the measurement. It will result in a shift in multi-modal features and the errors in the final output.</figcaption>
</figure>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Many methods have been proposed to solve the problem, varying from the hardware side like using more elaborate sensors and the software side like adaptive algorithms. Some algorithms estimate the correct features for different data, including data augmentation<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>, domain adaptation<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>, feature enhancement<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>, noise estimation<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>, and so on. They avoid the affects from noise in data by grabbing the invariant features or modifying the training data distribution. However, most of these methods are developed on single-modal models, which rely on the specific sensor measurement essentially. As illustrated in the Fig.<a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ I Introduction ‣ Informative Data Selection with Uncertainty for Multi-modal Object Detection" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>, generally we train and evaluate our models on the given datasets. Due to the limited amount of data, the statistical results on the datasets cannot reflect the true performance in reality, especially when sensors meet error beyond the cases in datasets, namely the out-of-distribution(OOD) problem. Therefore, redundancy in the data is also a vital aspect in practical deployment.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">For the reasons above, multi-modal fusion methods have gained attention in recent years<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>. SDVs are equipped with different sensors for more complete and precise perception. On one hand, multi-modal sets can provide complementary measurements, like cameras record the colors and textures, LiDARs provide the 3D structure of objects, and Radars observe the velocity of moving targets. On the other hand, multi-modal fusion can provide redundant information for stable recognition. Different sensors have specific working conditions, which means they all will potentially fail in some environments. For example, in the dark or foggy weather or with sharp illumination changes, the images from the camera may fail to recognize objects. As for LiDARs, particulate matters in the air can influence the LiDAR imaging in rainy, snowy, and sandy weather. With data fusion, sensing systems can avoid severe crash. Therefore, we mainly discuss the adaptive strategy of multi-modal fusion for SDV perception in this paper, especially on the object detection task.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">There has been much research in the multi-modal object detection of autonomous driving since the KITTI benchmark was released in 2012<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>. It is also recognized as a potential approach to realize robust detection. After that, various datasets and approaches have been proposed to accelerate the development of this community and achieve higher recognition accuracy as well<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>. In the early stage, model-based methods used bagging methods for result fusion<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>. They generally have individual pipelines to process different data and merge the bounding boxes to generate the final results. Latest data-driven methods mainly applied feature fusion (boosting or stacking) for a more profound information mixture that fuses multi-modal data in the feature extraction or Region of Interest (ROI) generation stage<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">However, existing fusion methods focus on the quantified scores in standard vision benchmarks, while few contribute to the robustness or generalization of fusion<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>. Models that can adapt to different inference datasets are critical for real-world applications. They can aggregate useful information from the high-dimensional feature space, thus avoiding the effect of noise on the results. It was pointed out a multi-modal model seek a balance between fitting data and generalization<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>. Its performance will meet a bottleneck without proper information reduction in fusion channels. Due to the same reason, it is more challenging to extend the training data via multi-modal data augmentation. In addition, when a multi-modal model has not been trained well as in Fig.<a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ I Introduction ‣ Informative Data Selection with Uncertainty for Multi-modal Object Detection" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>, it will generate greater variance with dirty multi-modal data. As a result, multi-modal fusion does not essentially guarantee an incrementation in performance and robustness. In other words, multi-modal models are not always effective in identifying and exploiting information in diverse data.</p>

<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">Different from those learning-based feature fusion models, we claim that adaptive fusion models should select informatively features from multi-source data and avoid noise in them. It can be viewed as one form of data dimensionality reduction, which is expected to be explainable. The amount of information is measured by entropy, so it can be equivalent to the calculation of the feature distribution. Since it is difficult to directly calculate the amount of information or entropy, we can choose to reflect the uncertainty of feature distribution to learn to characterize the amount of information. Driven by this idea, we propose an adaptive fusion method with a result fusion architecture. Considering that different modal data require specific operators and parameter optimization in feature processing, we adopt a loosely coupled network architecture, which is general but practical. Multi-modal data are fed to individual pipelines that are connected in the boxes filtering stage. Then we apply decision-level fusion by fusing the box proposals in the improved Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS). We will describe why our simple fusion strategy can filter information in data.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p7" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p7.1" class="ltx_p">To select informative results and achieve reliable fusion, we introduce uncertainty quantification into our model. Proper uncertainty quantification indicates the prediction deviation of the model, therefore, it has been viewed as a potential approach towards the interpretable neural network and an emerging method in autonomous driving<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>, <a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. In our model, we predict the uncertainty, as the inverse of information amount, for each data point. Through joint training on multi-modal data, our model learns a universal uncertainty measurement that can be used as the boxes filter index in NMS. To demonstrate the benefits of our design, and explore the noise affect in fusion models as well, we have evaluated the models on the KITTI 2D object detection dataset. Point clouds and RGB images were progressively perturbed to simulate multi-level dirty data. Then, we conducted experiments with both raw data and dirty data. For clean data, our fusion model achieved sub-optimal but competitive results, with only 0.36 mAP lower than Depth-model, while 4.24 mAP higher than RGB-model. As for dirty data, our achieved 51.61 mAP higher than RGB-model and 34.20 mAP higher than Depth-model on average. Our main contributions can be concluded as:</p>

<p id="S2.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Noisy data can mislead detection models because their object features are out of the distribution of the model fitting domain. Therefore, it is practical to extend the training set to provide more diverse data, or create feature filters to regularize noisy features. Data augmentation is one of the most common approaches for the former. PointDrop<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite> learns to drop some key points as features, thus generating more challenging point samples for training. Ofori-Oduro et al. used antibodies generated using Artificial Immune Systems in training<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>. Loh et al. proposed to collect data under different illumination conditions to enhance the model’s robustness<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>. Michaelis et al.<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite> provided a benchmark to simulate multiple noises in a natural environment that is presented in the Fig.<a href="#S1.F2" title="Figure 2 ‣ I Introduction ‣ Informative Data Selection with Uncertainty for Multi-modal Object Detection" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>. Besides, domain adaptation is another practical method. Transferring learned parameters(knowledge) among datasets can aggregate features distributions in different data domain<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>. Khodabandeh et al. proposed to use noisy-label in training to enhance the generalization<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>. Instead, researcher also concerns that whether we can directly extract and enhance related features. Bijelic et al. proposed a multi-sensor model and mix features in multiple levels for mutual activation<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>. Others also try to estimate the noise from the opposite perspective. Yang et al. built a model to estimate the accuracy of Laser measurement under foggy conditions<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>, and Tian et al. quantified the uncertainty level of features for adaptive fusion<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>. But most of them are developed on single-modal models, which indicates that they would fail when the sensor meets severe fault.</p>

All these fusion methods of RGB and LiDAR achieve high average precision on the benchmarks, however, the coupling or interrelation of two modalities will cause the whole system to fail easily once part of the sensors break down.

The network learns weights from input feature map from each modality in the presence of the modalities degraded in quality. Their following work proposes to design a specific loss function and feature fusion module to avoid noisy data in training<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>]</cite>. Different from those feature fusion models, Lee et al. proposed a late(result-level) fusion method named DBF<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>]</cite>, that applied fuzzy state estimation for multiple detectors outputs and fused them accordingly for a single image.

Furthermore, in terms of the back propagation, due to the lack of noise data in the training data, it is difficult to completely cover the existing noise types. Its distribution is always unbalanced relative to that in the real world. As a result, the parameter optimization after back propagation is not suitable for the case that the data contains interference, namely the OOD problem. Therefore, the fusion must be done in a way that is independent of the data distribution. The information-driven data selection proposed in this paper is implemented through a non-parameterized NMS process to avoid the problem of data distribution.</p>

But these researches mainly focus on simple networks. Belghazi et al.<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib40" title="" class="ltx_ref">40</a>]</cite> proposed a mutual information measurement method, that can be applied in simple informative data selection models<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib41" title="" class="ltx_ref">41</a>]</cite>.

<p id="S2.SS4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Recently, more attention focus on the provision of interpretability, beyond this, uncertainty estimation is one of the most important partition. General uncertainty estimation on computer vision including classification and regression. Gal et al.<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib44" title="" class="ltx_ref">44</a>]</cite> propose a framework to combine aleatoric uncertainty and epistemic uncertainty. They apply the framework to segmentation tasks and achieve new state-of-the-art results on depth regression and semantic segmentation benchmarks. UNO<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite> presents an uncertainty-aware fusion scheme and an additional data-dependent spatial temperature scaling method to complement the uncertainty estimation in semantic segmentation. There are also several techniques for uncertainty estimation in object detection. He et al.<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib45" title="" class="ltx_ref">45</a>]</cite> provide a bounding box regression with KL loss and substitute softer-NMS for traditional NMS so that they achieved more accurate object localization. Choi et al.<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib46" title="" class="ltx_ref">46</a>]</cite> modified parameters of YOLO network to gaussian distribution and use loss attenuation to compute the uncertainty of bounding box, and they also improve the mean average precision on the benchmark dataset. Similarly, Lee et al.<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib47" title="" class="ltx_ref">47</a>]</cite> purpose a method named Gaussian-FCOS which uses an anchor-free backbone and even achieves better performance. Kowol et al.<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib48" title="" class="ltx_ref">48</a>]</cite> also present an uncertainty-based strategy with camera and Radar with YOLOv3<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib49" title="" class="ltx_ref">49</a>]</cite> as baseline and use gradient boosting to make decision. They demonstrated that the strategy is effective in night scenes compared with single sensor baseline. Feng et al. progressively provide three works on 3D object detection based on uncertainty estimation, from pure point clouds to multi-modal fusion<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib50" title="" class="ltx_ref">50</a>, <a href="#bib.bib51" title="" class="ltx_ref">51</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>. With precise estimation, they can avoid the uncertain information from noisy samples in training, and aid the prediction for test data. Russell et al.<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib52" title="" class="ltx_ref">52</a>]</cite> show that for the visual tracking problem, accurate multivariate uncertainty quantification can have a great impact on performance for both in-domain and out-of-domain evaluation data.</p>

<div id="S2.SS4.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS4.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Most of the models above avoid specific types of noisy data. But most of these techniques do not consider either multi-modal situations or robustness of the model under various noise attacks. For example, Gaussian YOLOv3<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib46" title="" class="ltx_ref">46</a>]</cite> is developed for single-modal data, UNO<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite> is evaluated on semantic segmentation tasks, Feng<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite> and Zhang<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite> ignore many other types of noise data from environment. Hence, we intend to synthesize the advantages of those techniques in an uncertainty-aware multi-modal object detection model, and evaluate it with common types of dirty data.</p>

To improve the robustness and generate informative data selection fusion strategy, we build an uncertainty-aware model by estimating the aleatoric uncertainty of each bounding box of each modal via loss attenuation. Then it will be applied for boxes filtering in the NMS stage. To balance speed and accuracy, we choose a light-weight one-stage object detection model as our baseline, while our method should be easily extended to other classical object detection models.</p>

The backbone network is composed of residual blocks and convolution blocks, while each decoder branch mainly contains the convolution blocks. A convolution block comprises a 2D convolution layer, a batch normalization layer, and a Leaky ReLU activation. A residual block comprises various residual units, and each of them has two convolution blocks and a skip-layer concatenation. Decoders process the feature maps transmitted by the former blocks and the previous branch, which will be up-sampled to realize multi-scale detection. These designs improve the detection robustness and speed of YOLOv3. To apply YOLOv3 for LiDAR point clouds, we project points onto a 2D plane as the camera image, and process it as a 2D depth image.</p>

<p id="S3.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">As mentioned above, in most existing multi-modal fusion networks, the modalities are heavily coupled and do not consider any safety-critical environment. To weaken the interfere for fear that the modality will harm each other, we use parallel pipelines and use late fusion to combine the final result. The overview architecture are presented in the Fig.<a href="#S3.F4" title="Figure 4 ‣ III-A Problem Statement ‣ III Method ‣ Informative Data Selection with Uncertainty for Multi-modal Object Detection" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a>. RGB images and the projected depth images will be calibrated in space and size. Then they will be fed to individual pipelines. Though we apply YOLOv3 for both modalities, they also accepted different combinations of models, whether 3D or 2D, one-stage or two-stage. Besides, a potential scenario is to establish communication between the two models by fusing two modal features in the middle of the models<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>. Says it may get better characteristics, but in our exploring uncertainty-aware detection model, we don’t do this in order to avoid the model non-convergence issue and two modal data uncertainty interfere with each other. For the basic fusion model, we can simply fuse all the proposed bounding boxes and filter them in the joint NMS process, or apply NMS for each modality and conduct a second selection for them afterward. In the final version, this process will be revised to the uncertainty-aware multi-source NMS. The fusion model universally outputs all boxes onto the image 2D plane. Because of our loosely coupled design, the proposed fusion model is compatible with more different modalities and tasks, even with the addition of uncertainty fusion factors. But we will take LiDAR point clouds and camera images as example in our experiments.</p>

<p id="S3.SS4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Considering that it is difficult to calculate an accurate amount of information in data, we leverage a related statistic index uncertainty as the alternative. Both information and uncertainty describe the credibility of data to the target object category and locations, while uncertainty represents the inverse meaning of information or mutual information. In our fusion strategy, we mainly consider aleatoric uncertainty, since the noises in each modality caused by sensor failure or extreme weather can be better explained by aleatoric uncertainty. Generally speaking, aleatoric uncertainty can be interpreted as noise or vague in data or a label that is hard to fit.</p>

<p id="S3.SS4.p2.7" class="ltx_p">Though aleatoric uncertainty cannot be eliminated by adding more training data, it could be reduced with additional features or views. Therefore, our strategy can also be interpreted as a type of method to reduce aleatoric uncertainty using multiple modalities. To estimate the aleatoric uncertainty of each object in each modality, we apply the loss attenuation that integrates uncertainty estimation function in the training loss, and optimizes them together with neural networks. For object detection, we focus on the coordinates regression and classification. The traditional loss function is:</p>

In particular, in the case of a single target, the model may output 0 to N prediction boxes. In the training stage, the optimization of this loss function can constrain the prediction result of the model to be as close to the real value as possible, and the variance between the prediction boxes will not be too large. In the inference stage, based on the prediction variance and error obtained by this publicity, the quality of the prediction frame can be judged, so as to carry out effective fusion. This method and conclusion can be easily generalized to the case of multiple objectives. With the loss attenuation, the model is expected to predict proper uncertainty for boxes.</p>

All of these are computed for point-based and image-based models separately as shown in the six sub-figures. On a scatter plot, the degree to which all points converge to a ray from the origin indicates the degree of regression of these points. The degree to which these points are correlated. Therefore, we believe that we can intuitively show the correlation between confidence, uncertainty and IoU three commonly used indicators.</figcaption>

<p id="S3.SS5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We finally integrate the selection process in the improved-NMS. NMS can filter bounding box according to IOU and classification score. But the original algorithm only considers classification score and ignore the accuracy of localization. Typically, when considering model uncertainty, the classification score generated by softmax layer are probable to overestimate the score. Besides, lower-scored boxes may have higher localization confidence. To integrate uncertainty and combine the entire results of each modality in our model, softer-NMS<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib45" title="" class="ltx_ref">45</a>]</cite> has been proposed to substitute NMS.

<p id="S3.SS5.p2.3" class="ltx_p">In the case of multi-source fusion, we have predictions from multiple pipelines. If we mix the predictions of multiple modalities directly, we will ignore the pattern correlation across different modalities, and consistency within each modality respectively. Compared with general NMS and other fusion methods, that have different distributions for different datasets, our fusion strategy keeps the high consistency over different modality data and multi-source data, and significant relationship with localization and classification.

Confidence smoothing<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib53" title="" class="ltx_ref">53</a>]</cite> will be applied for all these boxes and variable methods can be chosen. For boxes from each single modality, we calculate the IoU with boxes from other modal detections and generate three cases. The logic gate aims to filter out those that are mutually verified. And others will be mixed in voting progress like normal NMS. For Case1, we focus on the highly similar boxes from all modal data. For Case2, we apply general softer-NMS to fuse boxes adaptively. However, in Case3, boxes from another modality are severely off position or even empty, which is more likely to drop the localization accuracy. We ignore them to avoid potential influence from them. The iteration is conducted according to the confidence scores, and will not affect the box adjustment due to its disorderliness. Uncertainty scores are applied in the following step. This fusion method can easily be extended to more modes or more sensors with little need to change the algorithm.</p>

Our fusion strategy can be easily changed to be based on other types of NMS, or even adapted to NMS-free models. For fusion models, we first train the pipelines separately to provide stable convergence for fusion. Then we concatenate two pipelines with joint NMS or our proposed method for joint optimization. We set the IoU threshold in NMS as 0.45 for the two single-modal models, as set the two thresholds as 0.45 and 0.7 in our proposed models.</p>

For comparison, we use average box selection(AvgFusion) as the default joint NMS method. Half of the boxes from two pipelines will be randomly dropped, and processed in one NMS step. In all experiments, we set the batch size as 16 and the initial learning rate as 0.0001.The experiment is conducted on NVIDIA GTX 1080Ti with CUDA 8.0 and cuDNN v7.</p>

Both AvgFusion and our model achieve the sub-optimal performance between RGB and depth models due to the lack of prior information in box selection/fusion. But our model has higher accuracy, and approaches the optimal modal performance on all objects, which demonstrates the benefits of our method on clean data, and the accuracy of our informative data selection that reflects the quality of fusion object boxes.</p>

Among them, the prediction accuracy of the RGB model shows a nonlinear decrease for the three types of noise, with mAP decreasing from 76.34 to 0.28(Gaussian), 6.30(Motion), and 7.23(Frost), respectively. Compared with the detection results of clean data, the accuracy of all 15 experiments decreases. Similarly, the prediction accuracy of the Depth model also decreases nonlinearly with increasing noise intensity, with mAP decreasing from 76.34 to 1.69(Gaussian), 31.62(Motion), and 24.86(Frost), respectively.

<p id="S5.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The results show that the degradation of detection accuracy is smaller when our proposed RGB-Depth fusion model is affected by the noise of only one modality. When the fusion model receives noisy RGB and Depth data(NR-D), only 5/15 experiments show accuracy degradation. Its average accuracy changes for the three RGB noisy data are -3.40 (Gaussian), -4.05 (Motion), and -3.74 (Frost). mAP decreases from 80.58 to 77.18, 76.53, and 76.84, respectively. it can be seen that the noise for the RGB data has very little effect on our proposed fusion model. The effect of noise on our proposed fusion model is very small. In addition, the detection error of Car is positively correlated with the noise intensity, but the other categories are not. This leads to a slight increase of mAP from the lowest point during the increasing noise intensity (in 10/15 experiments). This issue needs to be further explored in the subsequent work.</p>

When trained without any limitation, the network tends to assign more weights for the Depth branch, which will seriously affect the robustness of the model. Then we use imbalance data dropout(10% for RGB and 15% for Depth) and weight limitation(upper to 0.7 in the first five stages) to adjust the fusion weight in training. The adjustment slightly improved the performance. But it is far not enough, and adaptive balance fusion remains an open problem.</p>

<div id="S6.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we explore the robustness of single-modal and multi-modal models under noisy data, and claim that informative data selection is a simple but practical method in data fusion and anti-noise vision tasks. We present the conclusions on the relationship between data information and the performance of deep learning models, especially the performance of multimodal fusion models. It is pointed out that the information-driven selection strategy can improve the robustness of the fusion model. In addition, uncertainty can be used as an effective method to approximate the amount of data information. We analyze and reveal the robustness of multi-modal models on dirty data by comparing the accuracy decay of different models through experiments on the KITTI dataset. The experimental results show that the impact of noisy data on single-modal and multi-modal models is complex and involves many aspects like recognition target, recognition task, data modality combinations, noise type, etc. We also propose a novel multi-modal fused 2D target detection model. It performs selective fusion of bounding boxes generated by multiple independent sub-models based on informative data selection with uncertainty and can be applied to different modal data. Experimental results show that our fusion model can exhibit high detection accuracy when a clean data modality is present under severe noise interference. In addition, the robustness of the fusion model may show different results for different fusion structures, such as feature fusion. The robustness problem of multi-modal fusion models still needs to be studied in depth, and we will also focus on other tasks such as semantic segmentation and 3D target detection in our subsequent research to further investigate the phenomena observed in this paper.</p>

<div id="S6.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p2.1" class="ltx_p">As for another trend in research, although there is no literature specifically addressing this issue, it can be inferred from the latest research trends that a large model based on transformer can hopefully handle this issue well after training with enough data. However, this article hopes to present a simple and effective solution based on a non-parametric perspective. Compared with fitting the rich and varied real world, our method of directly measuring the information content of data provides researchers with a simple approach.</p>
