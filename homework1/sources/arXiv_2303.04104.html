<p id="id13.id1" class="ltx_p">This paper presents a deep learning system applied for detecting anomalies from respiratory sound recordings. Initially, our system begins with audio feature extraction using Gammatone and Continuous Wavelet transformation. This step aims to transform the respiratory sound input into a two-dimensional spectrogram where both spectral and temporal features are presented. Then, our proposed system integrates Inception-residual-based backbone models combined with multi-head attention and multi-objective loss to classify respiratory anomalies.
Instead of applying a simple concatenation approach by combining results from various spectrograms, we propose a Linear combination, which has the ability to regulate equally the contribution of each individual spectrogram throughout the training process. To evaluate the performance, we conducted experiments over the benchmark dataset of SPRSound (The Open-Source SJTU Paediatric Respiratory Sound) proposed by the IEEE BioCAS 2022 challenge. As regards the Score computed by an average between the average score and harmonic score, our proposed system gained significant improvements of 9.7%, 15.8%, 17.8%, and 16.1% in Task 1-1, Task 1-2, Task 2-1, and Task 2-2, respectively, compared to the challenge baseline system. Notably, we achieved the Top-1 performance in Task 2-1 and Task 2-2 with the highest Score of 74.5% and 53.9%, respectively.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">According to statistics from the World Health Organization (WHO) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>, global mortality caused by respiratory diseases including tuberculosis, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) has reached an alarming number of 6.2 million at the time of writing. Furthermore, the heavy workload on the healthcare systems is currently not uncommon in many countries as the number of patients demanding on examining their respiratory sound patterns is increasing while the number of clinicians is limited. At the early stage, respiratory diseases cause destruction or blocking of the airways of the lung, which lead to the limitation of airflow during the inhalation and exhalation phases. Therefore, respiratory sound analysis by machine learning or deep learning methods has recently attracted much attention. They can be used to automate the processing of longitudinal data recorded outside the clinical environment and assist clinicians to make an improved and informed decision to detect precisely different respiratory sound patterns in a scalable, noninvasive, and time-saving manner. Regarding machine learning methods <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>, respiratory sounds are first transformed into Mel-frequency cepstral coefficient (MFCC), referred to as hand-crafted features. Then, conventional machine learning models such as Hidden Markov Model <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>, Support Vector Machine <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>, and Decision Tree <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite> explore these handcrafted features to classify respiratory anomalies. Meanwhile, respiratory sounds are transformed into a two-dimensional spectrogram, where both temporal and spectral information are fully represented in a wider time context in deep learning-based systems. These spectrograms are then fed into powerful network architectures such as convolutional neural network (CNN) based architectures <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite> or recurrent neural network (RNN) based architectures <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite> for classification.
Compared to the performances between machine learning and deep learning-based approaches, the latter demonstrates more effectiveness for detecting respiratory anomalies <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>.</p>

<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">To leverage the deep learning-based approach, we propose in this paper a deep learning-based system for detecting anomalies in respiratory sounds.

Our contributions are as follows: (1) We investigated multiple spectrogram inputs extracted from Gammatone filter and Continuous Wavelet transformation, and then proposed an effective Linear combination method, which gathers complement information extracted from these individual spectrograms to form a comprehensively combined feature; (2) We also integrated multiple techniques of Inception-residual-based network architecture, multi-head attention, and multi-objective loss into our proposed system to fully exploit the combined feature and gained competitive results compared to state-of-the-art systems.</p>

<div id="S2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">As mentioned in Section <a href="#S1" title="I Introduction ‣ An Inception-Residual-based Architecture with Multi-objective Loss for Detecting Respiratory Anomalies" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">I</span></a>, we now analyze the related work of two main factors in a deep learning-based system for detecting anomalies from a respiratory sound: The front-end feature extraction using spectrograms and the back-end deep neural network architecture. Next, we then propose the main techniques which are applied to our proposed system to improve the performance.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Regarding the feature extraction, almost all of the state-of-the-art systems for detecting anomalies from respiratory sounds use Mel-filter <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite> or short-time
Fourier transformation (STFT) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite> to generate spectograms. However, as using the fixed window size, these types of spectrograms might not be able to well present discrimination between normal and abnormal respiratory sounds. To overcome this issue, we propose an alternative way of using multiple spectrograms with Wavelet-based spectrograms <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite> and Gammatone-filter-based spectrogram <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite> for this work. While the former generates a better multi-resolution analysis thanks to its suitability in adjusting both temporal window length and the wide frequency range across the length, the latter shows great ability to capture the energy of the sound signals in a lower frequency band, which is strongly related to the nature of respiratory sounds.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">As regards the deep neural network architecture, our prior work in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite> using an Inception-based network and ensemble of models with multiple spectrograms <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite> have witnessed the improvement to detect respiratory anomalies. Therefore, these inspire us to propose a new architecture of Inception-residual-based backbone model supported by multi-head attention and multi-objective loss to train multiple spectrograms at the same time. Additionally, rather than applying a naive ensemble of results from different spectrograms, a Linear combination, a part of our proposed model, is proposed to regulate equally the contribution of each individual spectrogram and generate a combined feature representing aspects from all spectrogram inputs during the training course.</p>

The dataset consists of 2683 audio recordings collected from 292 patients (whose age is from 1 month to 18 years old).
After being carefully inspected by experts, the quality of each recording was labeled as <span id="S3.SS1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Poor Quality (PQ)</span>, <span id="S3.SS1.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Normal (N)</span>, <span id="S3.SS1.p1.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Continuous Adventitious Sound (CAS)</span>, <span id="S3.SS1.p1.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Discontinuous Adventitious Sound (DAS)</span>, and <span id="S3.SS1.p1.1.5" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">CAS and DAS (CD)</span> with the recording numbers of 187, 1785, 233, 347, and 131, respectively.
For each audio event in a recording, the onset (i.e. starting time) and offset (i.e. ending time) are professionally labeled by respiratory experts.
There are total of 6887 audio events of <span id="S3.SS1.p1.1.6" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Normal (N)</span>, 53 audio events of <span id="S3.SS1.p1.1.7" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Rhonchi (Rho)</span>, 865 audio events of <span id="S3.SS1.p1.1.8" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Wheeze (W)</span>, 17 audio events of <span id="S3.SS1.p1.1.9" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Stridor (Str)</span>, 66 audio events of <span id="S3.SS1.p1.1.10" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Coarse Crackle (CC)</span>, 1167 audio events of <span id="S3.SS1.p1.1.11" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Fine Crackle (FC)</span> and 34 audio events of <span id="S3.SS1.p1.1.12" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Wheeze and Crackle (B)</span>.</p>

<p id="S3.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Given the SPRSound dataset, the IEEE BioCAS 2022 challenge proposed two main tasks.
First, <span id="S3.SS2.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Task 1</span>, which aims to focus on the sound event level, is divided into 2 sub-tasks: Task 1-1 and Task 1-2.
While Task 1-1 is to classify the respiratory sound events as Normal and Adventitious, Task 1-2 aims to classify these events into <span id="S3.SS2.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">N</span>, <span id="S3.SS2.p1.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Rho</span>, <span id="S3.SS2.p1.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">W</span>, <span id="S3.SS2.p1.1.5" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Str</span>, <span id="S3.SS2.p1.1.6" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">CC</span>, <span id="S3.SS2.p1.1.7" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">FC</span>, or <span id="S3.SS2.p1.1.8" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">B</span>.
Second, <span id="S3.SS2.p1.1.9" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Task 2</span> focuses on the entire recording, which is also separated into Task 2-1 and Task 2-2.
In particular, Task 2-1 accounts for classifying the respiratory recordings as Normal, Adventitious, and Poor Quality.

Next, re-sampled respiratory events presenting different recording lengths are then duplicated to obtain the same length of 10 seconds.
A band-pass filter of 60-2000 Hz is then applied to suppress background noise in every respiratory event.
After that, these respiratory events are transformed into a two-dimensional spectrogram by using Gammatone <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite> and Continuous Wavelet transformations.

The proposed Backbone Model based on Inception-residual-based network architecture comprises four blocks: one Doub-Inc Block, two Inc-Res Blocks, and one Pooling Block.
The Doub-Inc Block performs two Inc01 layers followed by Batch Normalization (BN), Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU), Average Pooling (AP[Kernel Size]), Dropout (Dr(Drop Ratio), and Residual Normalization (RN( <math id="S4.SS2.p2.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\lambda" display="inline"><semantics id="S4.SS2.p2.1.m1.1a"><mi id="S4.SS2.p2.1.m1.1.1" xref="S4.SS2.p2.1.m1.1.1.cmml">λ</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S4.SS2.p2.1.m1.1b"><ci id="S4.SS2.p2.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS2.p2.1.m1.1.1">𝜆</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S4.SS2.p2.1.m1.1c">\lambda</annotation></semantics></math> = 0.4)) inspired from<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>).
The Inc01 layer is a variant of the naive inception layer <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite> with fixed kernel sizes of [3×3], [1×1], and [4×1].
Regarding two Inc-Res Blocks, they share the same architecture, but channel numbers increase from 128 to 256 to form a deeper view of the channel dimension as inspired by our prior work in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>.
The detailed structure for every Inc-Res Block is described in the middle part of Fig. <a href="#S4.F2" title="Figure 2 ‣ IV The Proposed System ‣ An Inception-Residual-based Architecture with Multi-objective Loss for Detecting Respiratory Anomalies" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>, which features layers of Inc02[Channel×Kernel Size], Conv, BN, Dr, ReLU, AP, Max Pooling (MP[Kernel Size]), and RN( <math id="S4.SS2.p2.2.m2.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\lambda" display="inline"><semantics id="S4.SS2.p2.2.m2.1a"><mi id="S4.SS2.p2.2.m2.1.1" xref="S4.SS2.p2.2.m2.1.1.cmml">λ</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S4.SS2.p2.2.m2.1b"><ci id="S4.SS2.p2.2.m2.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS2.p2.2.m2.1.1">𝜆</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S4.SS2.p2.2.m2.1c">\lambda</annotation></semantics></math> = 0.4).
Notably, three different Inc02[Channel×Kernel Size] layers, which present different kernel sizes defined as [K×1], [K×K], and [1×K], are used in Inc_Res Block.
The value of K is changed as details on the right-hand side of Fig. <a href="#S4.F2" title="Figure 2 ‣ IV The Proposed System ‣ An Inception-Residual-based Architecture with Multi-objective Loss for Detecting Respiratory Anomalies" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>.
Following each Inc02 layer, an AP layer is applied before adding sub-branch results together. Furthermore, we propose to apply RN to form the Inc-Res Block as RN can be used as instance normalization with a shortcut path to eliminate the influence of unnecessary responses from some frequency bands during training (i.e. these influences caused by noises from environments like coughing, motion artifacts, and intestinal and physiological sounds when respiratory sounds are recorded). This idea strengthens the backbone to learn effectively not only the widespread frequency bands but also the distribution of energy in certain frequency bands from different types of anomalies in lung sound. The Pooling Block makes use of global pooling layers to extract three features from the second Inc-Res Block: (1) global average pooling across the channel dimension, (2) global max pooling across the temporal dimension, and (3) global average pooling across frequency dimensions.</p>

<p id="S4.SS2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">As the work in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite> indicates that each attention head learns a different set of weight matrices and when joining many self-attention heads together, it forms a multi-head self-attention layer which helps to learn an input feature map better. Therefore, in this work, we propose that the output of the Backbone Model (i.e. The output of the Pooling Block in Fig. <a href="#S4.F2" title="Figure 2 ‣ IV The Proposed System ‣ An Inception-Residual-based Architecture with Multi-objective Loss for Detecting Respiratory Anomalies" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>) is then presented to the Attention block as shown in Fig. <a href="#S4.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ IV The Proposed System ‣ An Inception-Residual-based Architecture with Multi-objective Loss for Detecting Respiratory Anomalies" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>.
At each Attention block, we apply three multi-head attention layers <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite> on three dimensions of frequency, time, and channel to fully exploit the embeddings extracted from different aspects of the spectrograms (i.e. specific embeddings extracted from different spectrograms).

As the use of multiple spectrograms has shown improvement as mentioned in Section <a href="#S2" title="II Related work and Motivation ‣ An Inception-Residual-based Architecture with Multi-objective Loss for Detecting Respiratory Anomalies" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">II</span></a>, we propose this Combiner block. We assume that each spectrogram contains distinct features, and then the Combined feature from the Combiner block are potentially better representing features from all the spectrograms for detecting anomalies in respiratory sounds. In this work, we propose two combination methods. The first method is simple concatenation.
In the second method, we assume that the feature embeddings <math id="S4.SS2.p5.3.m3.4" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\mathbf{e}[e_{1},e_{2},...,e_{E}]" display="inline"><semantics id="S4.SS2.p5.3.m3.4a"><mrow id="S4.SS2.p5.3.m3.4.4" xref="S4.SS2.p5.3.m3.4.4.cmml"><mi id="S4.SS2.p5.3.m3.4.4.5" xref="S4.SS2.p5.3.m3.4.4.5.cmml">𝐞</mi><mo lspace="0em" rspace="0em" id="S4.SS2.p5.3.m3.4.4.4" xref="S4.SS2.p5.3.m3.4.4.4.cmml">​</mo><mrow id="S4.SS2.p5.3.m3.4.4.3.3" xref="S4.SS2.p5.3.m3.4.4.3.4.cmml"><mo stretchy="false" id="S4.SS2.p5.3.m3.4.4.3.3.4" xref="S4.SS2.p5.3.m3.4.4.3.4.cmml">[</mo><msub id="S4.SS2.p5.3.m3.2.2.1.1.1" xref="S4.SS2.p5.3.m3.2.2.1.1.1.cmml"><mi id="S4.SS2.p5.3.m3.2.2.1.1.1.2" xref="S4.SS2.p5.3.m3.2.2.1.1.1.2.cmml">e</mi><mn id="S4.SS2.p5.3.m3.2.2.1.1.1.3" xref="S4.SS2.p5.3.m3.2.2.1.1.1.3.cmml">1</mn></msub><mo id="S4.SS2.p5.3.m3.4.4.3.3.5" xref="S4.SS2.p5.3.m3.4.4.3.4.cmml">,</mo><msub id="S4.SS2.p5.3.m3.3.3.2.2.2" xref="S4.SS2.p5.3.m3.3.3.2.2.2.cmml"><mi id="S4.SS2.p5.3.m3.3.3.2.2.2.2" xref="S4.SS2.p5.3.m3.3.3.2.2.2.2.cmml">e</mi><mn id="S4.SS2.p5.3.m3.3.3.2.2.2.3" xref="S4.SS2.p5.3.m3.3.3.2.2.2.3.cmml">2</mn></msub><mo id="S4.SS2.p5.3.m3.4.4.3.3.6" xref="S4.SS2.p5.3.m3.4.4.3.4.cmml">,</mo><mi mathvariant="normal" id="S4.SS2.p5.3.m3.1.1" xref="S4.SS2.p5.3.m3.1.1.cmml">…</mi><mo id="S4.SS2.p5.3.m3.4.4.3.3.7" xref="S4.SS2.p5.3.m3.4.4.3.4.cmml">,</mo><msub id="S4.SS2.p5.3.m3.4.4.3.3.3" xref="S4.SS2.p5.3.m3.4.4.3.3.3.cmml"><mi id="S4.SS2.p5.3.m3.4.4.3.3.3.2" xref="S4.SS2.p5.3.m3.4.4.3.3.3.2.cmml">e</mi><mi id="S4.SS2.p5.3.m3.4.4.3.3.3.3" xref="S4.SS2.p5.3.m3.4.4.3.3.3.3.cmml">E</mi></msub><mo stretchy="false" id="S4.SS2.p5.3.m3.4.4.3.3.8" xref="S4.SS2.p5.3.m3.4.4.3.4.cmml">]</mo></mrow></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S4.SS2.p5.3.m3.4b"><apply id="S4.SS2.p5.3.m3.4.4.cmml" xref="S4.SS2.p5.3.m3.4.4"><times id="S4.SS2.p5.3.m3.4.4.4.cmml" xref="S4.SS2.p5.3.m3.4.4.4"></times><ci id="S4.SS2.p5.3.m3.4.4.5.cmml" xref="S4.SS2.p5.3.m3.4.4.5">𝐞</ci><list id="S4.SS2.p5.3.m3.4.4.3.4.cmml" xref="S4.SS2.p5.3.m3.4.4.3.3"><apply id="S4.SS2.p5.3.m3.2.2.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS2.p5.3.m3.2.2.1.1.1"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S4.SS2.p5.3.m3.2.2.1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS2.p5.3.m3.2.2.1.1.1">subscript</csymbol><ci id="S4.SS2.p5.3.m3.2.2.1.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S4.SS2.p5.3.m3.2.2.1.1.1.2">𝑒</ci><cn type="integer" id="S4.SS2.p5.3.m3.2.2.1.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S4.SS2.p5.3.m3.2.2.1.1.1.3">1</cn></apply><apply id="S4.SS2.p5.3.m3.3.3.2.2.2.cmml" xref="S4.SS2.p5.3.m3.3.3.2.2.2"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S4.SS2.p5.3.m3.3.3.2.2.2.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS2.p5.3.m3.3.3.2.2.2">subscript</csymbol><ci id="S4.SS2.p5.3.m3.3.3.2.2.2.2.cmml" xref="S4.SS2.p5.3.m3.3.3.2.2.2.2">𝑒</ci><cn type="integer" id="S4.SS2.p5.3.m3.3.3.2.2.2.3.cmml" xref="S4.SS2.p5.3.m3.3.3.2.2.2.3">2</cn></apply><ci id="S4.SS2.p5.3.m3.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS2.p5.3.m3.1.1">…</ci><apply id="S4.SS2.p5.3.m3.4.4.3.3.3.cmml" xref="S4.SS2.p5.3.m3.4.4.3.3.3"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S4.SS2.p5.3.m3.4.4.3.3.3.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS2.p5.3.m3.4.4.3.3.3">subscript</csymbol><ci id="S4.SS2.p5.3.m3.4.4.3.3.3.2.cmml" xref="S4.SS2.p5.3.m3.4.4.3.3.3.2">𝑒</ci><ci id="S4.SS2.p5.3.m3.4.4.3.3.3.3.cmml" xref="S4.SS2.p5.3.m3.4.4.3.3.3.3">𝐸</ci></apply></list></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S4.SS2.p5.3.m3.4c">\mathbf{e}[e_{1},e_{2},...,e_{E}]</annotation></semantics></math> from each spectrogram have a linear relationship across their dimensions.
We then derive a data-driven combination method called Linear combination.
This Linear combination is proposed to combine the three high-level features with trainable weight and bias:</p>

This can be explained as Task 1-1 and 1-2 only focus on certain events, while Task 2-1 and 2-2 focus on the entire recording including different types of events, and poor quality recordings are treated as one of the categories in Task 2-1 and Task 2-2. Among individual spectrograms, WM has the best performance with HS in Task 1-1, Task 1-2, Task 2-1, and Task 2-2 are 80.9%, 68.2%, 63.4%, and 38.7%, respectively.</p>

However, Task 2-2 in System I witnesses an overfitting performance of 91.7% in SP. Notablly, although System I uses multiple spectrograms with simple concatenation, there is even a downgrade in performance in Task 1-1 with lower AS/HS of 81.2%/80.6% compared to 81.5%/80.9% in the best single spectrogram WM-branch.</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.p8" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p8.1" class="ltx_p">When the multi-head attention technique is applied as mentioned in System II, all performance criteria of SE/SP and AS/HS are improved compared with System I and single spectrogram branches. The issue of overfitting on SP in Task 2.2 of System I is also resolved. For instance, the performance of HS in Task 2-1 and Task 2-2 witnesses an improvement of 6.5% and 7.1%, respectively, compared to that in System I.</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.p9" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p9.1" class="ltx_p">Regarding System III, applying both Multi-head attention and a Linear combination of embedding features helps to further improve the performance and proves that System III achieves the best performance compared to the other evaluating systems. As shown in Table <a href="#S4.T1" title="TABLE I ‣ IV-B The back-end classification ‣ IV The Proposed System ‣ An Inception-Residual-based Architecture with Multi-objective Loss for Detecting Respiratory Anomalies" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">I</span></a>, the highest AS/HS of 84.9%/84.9% are observed in Task 1-1. On Task 1-2, this system also surpasses other systems in terms of AS and HS, with the results being 78.1% and 76.7%. Notably, the superiority of this system is reflected as HS in Task 2-2 witnesses a significant improvement of 18.2% and 11.1% compared with that in System I and System II, respectively. This again demonstrates that multi-head attention and Linear combination play a significant role in increasing performance. In addition, the implementation of contrastive loss in System III helps to significantly reduce the training time and comprehensively discriminate the distribution of embedding features among target classes.
For instance, Fig. <a href="#S6.F3" title="Figure 3 ‣ VI Conclusion ‣ An Inception-Residual-based Architecture with Multi-objective Loss for Detecting Respiratory Anomalies" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a> shows that
System III with contrastive loss converges faster at the same epoch of 65 compared to the same system without using the contrastive loss in Task 1-2.</p>

<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We have presented a deep learning system, which integrated an Inception-residual-based network architecture with various techniques such as multiple spectrogram inputs, multi-head attention, multi-objective loss, and a Linear combination for detecting and classifying anomalies in respiratory sounds. The experiment results on the IEEE BioCAS 2022 challenge have indicated that multi-head attention and Linear combination play a significant role in increasing performance. While multi-head attention helped to extract good embedding from each individual spectrogram, the Linear combination combined and regulated effectively the contribution of each individual spectrogram. The efficacy has been demonstrated in our proposed system (i.e. System III) with a very competitive Score of 84.9% in Task 1-1, 77.4% in Task 1-2, and Top-1 performance in both Task 2-1 and Task 2-2 with 74.5%, and 53.9%, respectively.</p>
