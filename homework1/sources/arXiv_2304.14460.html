<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">Accurate 3D object detection in all weather conditions remains a key challenge to enable the widespread deployment of autonomous vehicles, as most work to date has been performed on clear weather data. In order to generalize to adverse weather conditions, supervised methods perform best if trained from scratch on all weather data instead of finetuning a model pretrained on clear weather data. Training from scratch on all data will eventually become computationally infeasible and expensive as datasets continue to grow and encompass the full extent of possible weather conditions. On the other hand, naive finetuning on data from a different weather domain can result in catastrophic forgetting of the previously learned domain. Inspired by the success of replay-based continual learning methods, we propose Gradient-based Maximally Interfered Retrieval (GMIR), a gradient based sampling strategy for replay. During finetuning, GMIR periodically retrieves samples from the previous domain dataset whose gradient vectors show maximal interference with the gradient vector of the current update. Our 3D object detection experiments on the SeeingThroughFog (STF) dataset <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite> show that GMIR not only overcomes forgetting but also offers competitive performance compared to scratch training on all data with a <span id="id1.id1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">46.25%</span> reduction in total training time.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Human perception has the ability to learn incrementally and incorporate new information continuously while preserving previously learned knowledge. In contrast, standard artificial neural networks are known to suffer from catastrophic forgetting of previously seen data when learning on new data from a different domain. A common approach to alleviate forgetting is to retrain neural networks from scratch on all of the data each time a new domain is introduced. In many applications, the database will continue to grow and encompass new domains over time such that training on all of the data will eventually become prohibitive in terms of cost and computation time. In this perspective, continual learning (CL) enables a neural network to learn sequentially on data collected in new domains while retaining knowledge of previously learned domains <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">An important application that can benefit from continual learning is 3D object detection for autonomous driving in different weather conditions. Most large-scale autonomous driving datasets, such as Waymo <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite> and NuScenes <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>, have been mainly collected in clear weather conditions. As a result, recent object detection models have mostly been trained on clear weather data. With a surplus of models trained only on clear weather data, the question yet to be answered is how these models can be fine-tuned on adverse weather data without forgetting their training on clear weather data. Recent developments in CL, as surveyed by De Lange et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>, show that it is possible to train a model sequentially on new data without forgetting old knowledge. Van de Ven et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite> categorize CL scenarios into three types: 1) Task Incremental Learning (IL), 2) Domain IL, 3) Class IL. The task of learning on adverse weather domain without forgetting about previously learned clear weather data is a domain IL task. Although, domain IL approaches typically involve multiple sessions, where the model is finetuned on a new domain in each session, our experiments only show results for incremental learning from one domain to another. A related field in computer vision, called ‘Domain Adaptation (DA)’, aims to utilize labelled data from a source domain to perform well on a different target domain for which labels are scarce. In this paper, we assume that sufficient labels are available for both source and target domains. Hence, our work is more closely related to domain IL.
CL scenarios can be further split into offline and online settings. Online CL methods learn on a stream of samples (not-iid) observed only once as they arrive, whereas offline approaches process data in batches for many epochs. Offline learning is more common in the autonomous driving industry as it allows engineers more time to test and perfect the model before guaranteeing its safe deployment. Hence, our work considers the offline CL setting, where it assumes that the data from the new domain is available to train offline. Although offline learning allows more time to train, training from scratch on all LiDAR data can be very time consuming. For example, training a 3D object detector, such as PV-RCNN <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>, on full clear weather Waymo dataset using 4 T4 16Gb GPUs approximately takes around 8-9 days. On top of this, adding new domains to the dataset and tuning hyperparameters will significantly increase the total training time and consequently delay the final deployment of the model.</p>

<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">A prominent class of approaches used in CL, called <span id="S1.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">rehearsal</span> or <span id="S1.p3.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">replay</span> based methods, train on a subset of samples from previous task/domain <span id="footnote1" class="ltx_note ltx_role_footnote"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">1</sup><span class="ltx_note_outer"><span class="ltx_note_content"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">1</sup><span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_note">1</span>”Task” and ”domain” are used interchangeably.</span></span></span>, known as ”replay samples”, while learning new tasks to alleviate forgetting. Existing replay-based approaches are primarily designed for the online CL setting, whereby computations for replay sample retrieval <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite> or gradient projection <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite> are executed every iteration. Such methods when directly employed in offline training offer little to no benefit over scratch training on all data as they consume relatively higher training time or memory while offering diminished performance. Ideally, we want an efficient learning strategy that can improve performance on both old and new domains (compared to scratch training on individual domains), commonly known as positive backward and forward transfer, respectively.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">One of the primary goals of replay-based methods is to select replay samples for maximum reduction in forgetting <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>. Inspired by Maximally Interfered Retrieval (MIR) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>, our work answers the question of which samples should be replayed to mitigate forgetting. While MIR is designed for the online CL setting, our work deals with offline learning. The key idea behind MIR is to populate a mini-batch with previous task samples that suffer from an increase in loss given the estimated parameters update of the model. Unlike MIR, our work, GMIR, periodically retrieves samples which exhibit maximal interference based on the <span id="S1.p4.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">gradient vector directions</span> compared to the gradient vector from the latest parameter update. While studies related to domain incremental learning for 2D object detection <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite> and class-incremental learning for indoor 3D object detection <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite> exist, to the best of our knowledge, we are the <span id="S1.p4.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">first</span> to study offline domain incremental learning for efficient training of 3D object detectors in outdoor scenes.

<div id="S2.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Regularization methods introduce an extra regularization term in the loss function while training on the new data to penalize forgetting on old data. Zhizhong Li et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite> proposed knowledge distillation for class and task incremental learning, which only uses new task data to train the network while preserving the original capabilities.
It has been shown that this strategy is vulnerable to domain shift between tasks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>. Another class of regularization methods estimates the importance of neural network parameters for old tasks. During training of later tasks, changes to important parameters are penalized.
Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite> was the first work to establish this approach. Later, Synaptic Intelligence (SI) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite> proposed a method to estimate importance weights online during task training.</p>

Instead of joint training with previous task samples, GEM <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite> proposes to constrain new task updates by projecting its gradient direction onto the feasible region outlined by previous task gradients. A-GEM <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite> reduces the update complexity by projecting the gradient on one direction estimated from a small collection of randomly selected replay samples. Both GEM and A-GEM allow for positive backward transfer.

GSS <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite> aims to store diverse samples in the replay buffer by keeping samples whose gradient vectors exhibit small cosine similarity among each other.
Instead of diversifying the memory buffer, MIR <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite> proposes to replay only those samples from memory which exhibit an increase in loss due to the estimated parameter update of the model. In terms of computation, for every iteration the method requires forward passing all previously stored samples twice per iteration to compute per sample losses before and after the estimated parameter update. Additionally, it requires two backward passes per iteration, one for the estimated parameter update and one for the final parameter update. Simplifying MIR for the offline setting, we propose replaying samples that show maximal gradient interference with the current gradient vector. While MIR chooses samples to replay in each minibatch, our gradient-based approach chooses maximal interfering samples to keep in the memory buffer for a fixed number of epochs before resampling. Hence, our approach is less computationally expensive and leads to a stable offline learning process.</p>

For example, during the finetuning stage, if the gradient vector of the model points in the opposite direction of the gradient vectors computed at some of the old domain samples with respect to the current parameters, the model will update its parameters in a direction that will increase the loss on the old domain samples, resulting directly in forgetting. In order to mitigate forgetting on these samples, we include them in the training set. As the model’s parameters change during finetuning, the subset of old domain samples which the model may be forgetting also change. Hence, we periodically resample the old domain samples to update the replay buffer with the latest interfering samples.

From the results, we make the following observations:
<br class="ltx_break"><span id="S5.SS1.p1.1.11" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Naive finetuning:</span> As expected, naive finetuning on the <span id="S5.SS1.p1.1.12" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">adverse</span> split leads to forgetting on the <span id="S5.SS1.p1.1.13" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">clear</span> split and positive transfer on <span id="S5.SS1.p1.1.14" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">adverse</span> split.
<br class="ltx_break"><span id="S5.SS1.p1.1.15" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Regularization:</span> Simply lowering the learning rate (LR) reduces forgetting compared to naive finetuning but can sometimes slow down learning on the new domain as evident from the negative forward transfer in VoxelRCNN. Low LR, however, performs better than EWC on both domains. Although we did not tune EWC, we hypothesize that increasing EWC weight parameter for regularization term may reduce forgetting but it may also reduce forward transfer. 
<br class="ltx_break"><span id="S5.SS1.p1.1.16" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Regularization vs Replay:</span> Baseline replay methods, i.e. MIR and A-GEM, result in positive forward transfer and reduced or zero forgetting compared to EWC. This is expected since replay methods have access to a subset of clear training samples.
<br class="ltx_break"><span id="S5.SS1.p1.1.17" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Replay baselines:</span> A-GEM, A-GEM+ and Fixed Sampling replay do sometimes exhibit positive backward transfer but their performance is not consistent between the two object detectors. Looking at the mAP of all baseline replay methods, A-GEM+ results in the highest mAP. 
<br class="ltx_break"><span id="S5.SS1.p1.1.18" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Fixed Sampling vs Randomly Resampling:</span> Surprisingly, fixed buffer replay gives better performance than randomly resampling the buffer every 10 epochs. One would expect random resampling to increase the diversity of samples seen by the algorithm and hence lead to better generalization performance than fixed buffer replay. However, random resampling can potentially lead to a buffer which gives similar gradients to the adverse weather samples and hence may not be useful for learning. Also, learning on the same group of samples for more iterations leads to a more stable training which could explain higher performance of fixed buffer replay.
<br class="ltx_break"><span id="S5.SS1.p1.1.19" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">GMIR/GMIR+ vs all baselines:</span> The results show that resampling the replay buffer periodically with maximally interfering samples throughout the training gives better performance than other baseline replay methods. Comparing GMIR to MIR, we see that resampling every 10 epochs instead of every epoch allows the model to iteratively learn on the same group of samples for more iterations, which results in better performance. Hence, GMIR is better suited to offline learning.
Since GMIR outperforms both A-GEM and A-GEM+, it shows that smart resampling of buffer is sufficient for both positive backward and forward transfer as opposed to constraining parameter updates. We also note that the performance of GSS could be limited by the approximation of gradient vectors from 1% of model parameters. We leave the adaptation of GSS to offline learning setting to future work. Overall, both GMIR and GMIR+ not only overcome forgetting but achieve the highest positive backward and forward transfer compared to the baselines. Surprisingly, GMIR and GMIR+ also sometimes outperform scratch training on all data on one of the domains.</p>

A-GEM takes the longest to train. This is because every iteration A-GEM requires loading a <span id="S5.SS3.p1.9.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">clear</span> batch separately in addition to the <span id="S5.SS3.p1.9.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">adverse</span> batch which can be time consuming. Moreover, training time for A-GEM increases with the number of times gradient projection is required. Worst-case time complexity for A-GEM is in the order of total number of training iterations, assuming gradient projection is required in every iteration.

<p id="S6.p1.2" class="ltx_p">Although GMIR reduces the training time compared to scratch training on all of the data, our implementation of GMIR calculates the interference score one sample at a time. A more efficient implementation of GMIR can be to parallelize interference score calculation across multiple GPUs which will significantly reduce the overhead time. The main limitation of our method is that it assumes we have a subset of old domain dataset in memory to retrieve samples from. The size of the old dataset will grow as we include data from new domains. Hence, storing old dataset in memory can be infeasible due to storage constraints. Although, we have shown that GMIR works well even with 20% of old data in memory, we can further try to bound the old dataset size by storing only those samples that were replayed most frequently in the previous training. Moreover, GMIR is sensitive to the tuning of hyperparameters <math id="S6.p1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="K" display="inline"><semantics id="S6.p1.1.m1.1a"><mi id="S6.p1.1.m1.1.1" xref="S6.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml">K</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S6.p1.1.m1.1b"><ci id="S6.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S6.p1.1.m1.1.1">𝐾</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S6.p1.1.m1.1c">K</annotation></semantics></math> and <math id="S6.p1.2.m2.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="n" display="inline"><semantics id="S6.p1.2.m2.1a"><mi id="S6.p1.2.m2.1.1" xref="S6.p1.2.m2.1.1.cmml">n</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S6.p1.2.m2.1b"><ci id="S6.p1.2.m2.1.1.cmml" xref="S6.p1.2.m2.1.1">𝑛</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S6.p1.2.m2.1c">n</annotation></semantics></math>, which may be dataset and model dependent.</p>

<p id="S7.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We have proposed a strategy to retrieve important samples from previous domains which can be used for fine-tuning the previous model on new domains for domain incremental 3D object detection. Through 3D object detection experiments, we have shown that fine-tuning with maximal interfering previous domain samples overcomes forgetting and improves performance on both old and new domains, outperforming random sampling and standard baselines. Our method offers an efficient alternative to scratch training on all data.</p>
