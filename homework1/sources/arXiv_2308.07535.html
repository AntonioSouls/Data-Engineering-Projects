<p id="id5.id1" class="ltx_p">Despite significant success of deep learning in object detection tasks, the standard training of deep neural networks requires access to a substantial quantity of annotated images across all classes. Data annotation is an arduous and time-consuming endeavor, particularly when dealing with infrequent objects.
Few-shot object detection (FSOD) methods have emerged as a solution to the limitations of classic object detection approaches based on deep learning. FSOD methods demonstrate remarkable performance by achieving robust object detection using a significantly smaller amount of training data. A challenge for FSOD is that instances from novel classes that do not belong to the fixed set of training classes appear in the background and the base model may pick them up as potential objects. These objects behave similarly to label noise because they are classified as one of the training dataset classes, leading to FSOD performance degradation. We develop a semi-supervised algorithm to detect and then utilize these unlabeled novel objects as positive samples during the FSOD training stage to improve FSOD performance. Specifically, we develop a hierarchical ternary classification region proposal network (HTRPN) to localize the potential unlabeled novel objects and assign them new objectness labels to distinguish these objects from the base training dataset classes. Our improved hierarchical sampling strategy for the region proposal network (RPN) also boosts the perception ability of the object detection model for large objects. We test our approach and COCO and PASCAL VOC baselines that are commonly used in FSOD literature. Our experimental results indicate that our method is effective and outperforms the existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) FSOD methods. Our implementation is provided as a supplement to support reproducibility of the results  <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/zshanggu/HTRPN" title="" class="ltx_ref ltx_url ltx_font_typewriter">https://github.com/zshanggu/HTRPN</a>.<span id="footnote1" class="ltx_note ltx_role_footnote"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">1</sup><span class="ltx_note_outer"><span class="ltx_note_content"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">1</sup><span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_note">1</span>Early partial results of this work is presented in the 2023 ICCV Workshop on Visual Continual Learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>.</span></span></span></p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The integration of deep neural network (DNN) architectures into object detection has revolutionized the field, resulting in development of powerful models for accurately identifying and localizing objects of interest within an image. Object recognition DNNs have significantly improved the ability to automatically determine the precise location and category of objects of interest, providing invaluable insights for a wide range of applications. In the presence of abundant training data, object detection models that employ the region-based convolution neural networks (R-CNN) architecture <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite> have demonstrated remarkable perofrmnace in achieving high levels of accuracy across a broad spectrum of object detection tasks. While large-scale annotated training data can be a valuable resource for many applications, it can pose a significant challenge in certain domains, such as the analysis of miscellaneous diseases and industrial defect detection <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>. Developing and curating high-quality annotated data requires extensive expertise in relevant fields, careful selection of relevant sources, and rigorous quality control measures to ensure accuracy and consistency across different datasets. Additionally, handling large volumes of data can require specialized hardware and software infrastructure, which may be costly and time-consuming to implement. In the presence of insufficient training data, DNNs overfit and fail to generalize well during the testing page. Despite similarities between deep neural network and the nervous sytem<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>, humans possess an exceptional ability to quickly and accurately classify novel object classes based on a handful of samples <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>. This ability has motivated the development of models that can learn object classes with only a few samples, known as few-shot object detection (FSOD) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>. FSOD methods have become increasingly popular due to their potential to generalize well on unseen data, their efficiency in handling limited training examples, and boradening the applicability of deep learning.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Currently, the predominant approach to FSOD involves pre-training a suitable model using a set of base classes that possess ample training data. This process enables the model to acquire a robust understanding of the basic helpful features and patterns within these classes. Once trained, the model is then fine-tuned on both the base classes and new classes that are more challenging to learn due to their limited sample size. The fine-tuning process allows the model to adapt to new classes and improve its performance on previously unseen classes during pre-training (see Figure <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ Improved Region Proposal Network for Enhanced Few-Shot Object Detection" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>). In other words, it is assumed that classes of interest can be divided into abundant base classes and few-shot classes.
The fundamental methodology employed in FSOD is to benefit from ideas in transfer learning or meta-learning to learn novel classes <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>, <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>, <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>, while preserving satisfactory performance levels in the base categories. This approach entails utilizing the knowledge acquired during the pre-training phase to learn new classes, while simultaneously ensuring that the model’s recongition ability in its original base classes remains intact. Despite advances in FSOD, most existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) techniques fail to yield favorable outcomes when applied to few-shot classes that share similarities with the base classes. For example, we can see in Figure <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ Improved Region Proposal Network for Enhanced Few-Shot Object Detection" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a> that some novel classes (e.g., the cow in the input image) might encounter objectness inconsistency, i.e., some of the instances remain unlabeled in the base class images and are therefore treated as background objects, while the labeled instances are treated as foreground objects. Potential reasons for this performance gap include the confusion between visually similar categories, incorrect annotations (label noise), the existence of unseen novel objects during training, etc. Recent FSOD methods have focused on addressing these challenges to improve FSOD performance.</p>

Some instances that remain unlabeled are typically ignored during training, resulting in a significant impact on the convergence of model training. To address this issue, our proposed HTRPN architecture takes into account the importance of these unlabeled instances and incorporates them into the training process. By doing so, we can improve the overall performance of the model and ensure its ability to generalize well to unseen data.</span></figcaption>

<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we focus on a challenge that has not been recognized and addressed in the FODL literature.
Specifically, we study the phenomenon that unlabeled novel object classes that do not belong to either of the base or the few-shot classes can appear in the training data. For example, we see in Figure. <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ Improved Region Proposal Network for Enhanced Few-Shot Object Detection" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a> that among base-class training samples, there are a number of objects that remain unlabeled, such as the cow in the image. These unlabeled objects can potentially belong to unseen novel classes. Our experiments demonstrate that this phenomenon exists in both PASCAL VOC <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite> and COCO <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite> datasets. Similarly, this situation can also ocurr in real-word industrial applications.
This phenomenon leads to the objectness inconsistency for the model when recognizing the novel objects: for the novel class, objects are treated as background if their annotations are missing, but they are treated as foreground when they are labeled. In other word, these instances lead to inconsistencies within each concept class and degrade the performance similar to the effect of concept shift <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>, <a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>, <a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite>. Such nonconformity of foreground and background confuses the model when predicting the objectness for these instances and make the model hard to converge and degrades detection accuracy. Additionally, when these instances are identified as one of the training set classes, they serve as noisy labels.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">To tackle the above challenge, we develop a semi-supervised learning method to utilize the potential novel objects that appear during training to improve the ability of the model to recognize novel classes to avoid confusing them with instances of training classes. To this end, we first demonstrate the possibility of detecting these unlabeled objects, despite the fact that they are novel, i.e., labeled instances of these instances do not exist in the training dataset. Our experiment indicates that some unlabeled class objects are likely to be recognized if they are similar to the training base and novel classes. We collect the unlabeled novel objects from the background proposals by determining whether they are predicted as known classes, and then we give these proposals an extra objectness label in the region proposal network (RPN) so that the model can learn to identify them and distinguish them from the base classes. We also analyze the defect of the standard RPN in detecting objects of different sizes during training and propose a more balanced RPN sampling method so that objects are treated equally in all scales. We provide extensive experimental results to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on the PASCAL VOC and COCO datasets.

<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In our formulation, we assume that there are three classes in an FSOD setting: base classes, seen novel classes, and unseen novel classes. The base and the seen novel classes form the training dataset together and the goal is to train a model to indetify all of them. For base classes, we have sufficient instances of annotated data but for seen novel classes, we have a few samples per class. Most works in FSOD only consider these classes for evaluation. The unseen novel classes are not included in the training data but emerge as novel classes in the background due to missing explicit label. Instances of these classes exist in background without being included in the annotated samples.</p>

In the realm of object detection, there exist two primary paradigms to design suitable architectures: one-stage and two-stage networks. Two-stage networks, such as R-CNN <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite>, R-FCN <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite>, Fast-RCNN <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>, and Faster-RCNN <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>, are commonly employed for their simplicity and efficiency. Two-stage object detection networks offer more flexibility and accuracy but come with increased training and inference complexity. In these networks, a region proposal network (RPN) is used to generate a set of potential object regions, which are then passed through a second stage classifier to produce instance-level class probabilities and a box regression head to give the precise location for each object. This approach allows for better handling of objects with varying sizes, shapes, and occlusions, as well as the ability to incorporate context information from neighboring regions. One-stage object detection networks, such as SSD  <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite>, YOLO series  <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>, <a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite>, and Overfeat  <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite>, have gained significant attention due to their efficiency and simplicity. These networks estimate both the category and the location of an object directly from the backbone network without the need for a RPN. By bypassing the RPN stage, one-stage networks can achieve faster inference times and lower resource requirements <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>.In the field of FSOD, we prioritize the accuracy of object detection as a critical issue. To assess the performance of our FSOD models, we have chosen to use the widely-recognized two-stage approach, which has been extensively studied and validated in previous works.</p>

<p id="S2.p3.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S2.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Few-shot object detection</span> (FSOD), is a case of object detection and a subfield of few-shot learning  <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>, <a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>, <a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>, <a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite> that specifically deals with the task of detecting objects in new scenes or conditions where only a handful of annotated examples are available for training. In general, few-shot object detection involves two key challenges: (1) the scarcity of training data, which can limit the accuracy and robustness of the model and (2) the need to generalize to novel objects, which requires the model to be able to recognize and classify objects that it has not seen before. To address these challenges, researchers have proposed a range of techniques. Two such approaches that have gained significant attention are meta-learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>, <a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">38</a>, <a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">39</a>]</cite> and transfer learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib40" title="" class="ltx_ref">40</a>, <a href="#bib.bib41" title="" class="ltx_ref">41</a>, <a href="#bib.bib42" title="" class="ltx_ref">42</a>]</cite>. Meta-learning focuses on learning how to learn and specifically is inspired by studying how humans acquire knowledge and adapting this approach to the specific task of few-shot object detection. This approach involves developing models that can learn to learn from a small number of scenarios, allowing them to adapt quickly to new situations and improve their accuracy over time. Transfer learning, on the other hand, involves leveraging knowledge from related tasks with more data to improve the performance of novel object detection, even though there are only a few examples available for training and potentially no samples <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib43" title="" class="ltx_ref">43</a>]</cite>. Recent research on few-shot learning has demonstrated that sufficient pre-training is non-negligible and could significantly improve the recognition ability of the model when transferring to a new few-shot task, especially with huge models as backbone such as vision transformers <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib44" title="" class="ltx_ref">44</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p4.6" class="ltx_p">The typical approach to address FSOD involves two phases: pre-training and fine-tuning. During the pre-training phase, the model is trained on the set of base classes for which we possess a sufficient number of annotated data points. This stage allows the model to learn extracting generalizable features and patterns that can be applied to identify novel classes. Once the pre-training phase is complete, the model is then fine-tuned on a subset of novel classes, each with a limited number of samples <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>. The purpose of the fine-tuning step is to further adapt the model to the specific characteristics of the unseen novel classes, ensuring that it can accurately classify them using the learned features and patterns from the pre-training phase.

<p id="S2.p5.6" class="ltx_p">The typical approach to address FSOD involves two phases: pre-training and fine-tuning. During the pre-training phase, the model is trained on the set of base classes for which we possess a sufficient number of annotated data points. This stage allows the model to learn extracting generalizable features and patterns that can be applied to identify novel classes. Once the pre-training phase is complete, the model is then fine-tuned on a subset of novel classes, each with a limited number of samples <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>. The purpose of the fine-tuning step is to further adapt the model to the specific characteristics of the unseen novel classes, ensuring that it can accurately classify them using the learned features and patterns from the pre-training phase.

In an object detection problem, the set of the base and the seen novel classes are assumed to be a closed set. However, there may be potential novel unseen objects in the training dataset that do not belong to the initial set of classes. These objects naturally are classified as one of seen classes and hence, there has been an interest to mitigate the adverse effects of these objects <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib59" title="" class="ltx_ref">59</a>]</cite>. Semi-supervised object detection network is a potential solution for this problem which utilizes the challenging samples  <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib60" title="" class="ltx_ref">60</a>, <a href="#bib.bib61" title="" class="ltx_ref">61</a>, <a href="#bib.bib62" title="" class="ltx_ref">62</a>]</cite>. Kaul et al.  <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite> build a class-specific self-supervised label verification model to identify candidates of unlabeled (unseen) objects and give them pseudo-annotations. The model is then retrained with these pseudo-annotated samples to improve the object-detecting accuracy. However, this method requires two rounds of training and requires extra effort to adapt to other categories. Li et al.  <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib63" title="" class="ltx_ref">63</a>]</cite> propose a distractor utilization loss by giving the distractor proposals a pseudo-label during fine-tuning. This method is used only in the fine-tuning stage and hence, the objectness inconsistency from the pre-training stage is not addressed. Motivated by these drawbacks, we propose employing the unlabeled potential objects that belong to the unseen classes to ameliorate the detrimental impact of seen novel objects.</p>

Supervised contrastive learning is a classic form of contrastive learning that involves the use of labeled samples. In this approach, an encoder is employed to extract the distinctive features for each sample, and then a contrastive loss is constructed by assessing the consistency between the labels of sample pairs and their distance metric. Specifically, sample pairs with different labels but smaller feature distance are expected to have higher loss values, while those with similar labels and larger feature distances are expected to have lower loss values. Supervised contrastive learning in few-shot object detection is introduced by FSCE <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite> to better distinguish similar categories at instance level during fine-tuning, a contrastive learning module is added parallel to the box regression layer and classification layer so that the inter/intra-class distances of the predicted instances could be well-balanced. We benefit from this strategy in our work by applying contrastive learning to the region proposal (RPN) layer. The region proposals suffer from severe foreground-background unbalancing, therefore, contrastive learning would be a effective strategy in here to improve the objectness evaluation ability of the RPN layer.</p>

<div id="S4.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">To propose our solution, we first demonstrate that there are instances of novel unseen classes that can be encountered in the training stage such that they are ruled as objects and then labeled as instances of seen classes. We then investigate the relationship between the number of anchors and the size of objects in each feature layer and provide a more effective sampling method for object detection. Finally, we describe our proposed pipeline to pick up objects from unseen classes with high confidence and then explain how we can modify their objectness loss to reduce their adverse effect to improve FSOD performance.</p>

<p id="S4.SS1.p1.2" class="ltx_p">In the original Faster R-CNN network <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib79" title="" class="ltx_ref">79</a>]</cite>, the unlabeled area in an image is often treated as background objects during training. As a result, we may have incorrect objectness scores for these regions which in turn would result in poor performance on the object detection task. As a result, the potential unlabeled objects from unseen novel classes are suppressed and can be difficult to identify as true objects. However, in order to correct the objectness of these potential objects, the first step is to locate them. We have observed empirically that the network often has clear attention to the potential objects in the RPN layer, irrespective of them being instances of seen classes.
As an example, we have used Grad-CAM visualization <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">selvaraju2017grad</span>]</cite> of the feature map of the RPN layer on two representative training images, as shown in Figure. <a href="#S3.F2" title="Figure 2 ‣ 3 Problem Description ‣ Improved Region Proposal Network for Enhanced Few-Shot Object Detection" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>, for R-CNN. Grad-CAM is a visual interpretation technique for convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which allows users to understand the importance of different spatial regions in an image for a given prediction by highlighting the regions that contribute the most to the final decision. This technique has been widely used in computer vision applications, such as object detection and segmentation, to improve interpretability and user understanding of CNN predictions. Although novel unlabelled objects appear in the base training images, we observe upon close inspection that the RPN layer has strong attention towards them and can predict some of them as known classes.

This observation serves as an inspiration to identify potential proposals that contains objects from unseen classes because some novel objects have high possibilities to be predicted as known base class. Effect of these cases on few-shot learning is more severe because they can interfere more easily with a few samples. We also alter the FSOD training phase such that the model is enabled to identify and discard these instances using contrastive learning.</p>

HSamp sampling strategy is effective when using a pre-defined number of training anchors compared to the random selecting strategy. Increasing the number of training anchors is beneficial, but it also increases computational load. If more anchors are randomly selected, there may still be a <span id="S4.SS1.p3.14.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">quantity bias</span> towards small objects over larger ones, leading to a large portion of middle to large objects being discarded. HSamp strategy addresses these shortcomings. We conclude that it is essential to employ a balanced approach in sampling negative anchors across all feature layers to identify potential novel objects that are not yet present in the seen novel classes. This method will assist us in distinguishing unseen novel class instances from those that are similar to the seen classes. We can use them to enable the model to distinguish them from instances of base classes.</p>

<p id="S4.SS2.p1.2" class="ltx_p">As mentioned in Section <a href="#S4.SS1" title="4.1 Finding the Potential Proposals ‣ 4 Proposed solution ‣ Improved Region Proposal Network for Enhanced Few-Shot Object Detection" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4.1</span></a>, Faster R-CNN is capable of identifying a significant number of potential novel objects that belong to unseen classes, even though they are not labeled during the training phase on the base class images. We hypothesize that this ability is due to the similarities of the feature representations between some novel unseen classes and some of the base classes. The expamples provided in Figure <a href="#S3.F2" title="Figure 2 ‣ 3 Problem Description ‣ Improved Region Proposal Network for Enhanced Few-Shot Object Detection" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a> also support this hypothesis. Consequently, the model may predict a novel unseen class object as a base class due to its resemblance to the base classes. In other words, the novel objects contained by the negative anchors may have a relatively high classification score towards a base class that is the most similar to them. We mark the negative anchors that contain potential novel unseen class objects as potential anchors (<math id="S4.SS2.p1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="A_{p}" display="inline"><semantics id="S4.SS2.p1.1.m1.1a"><msub id="S4.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1" xref="S4.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml"><mi id="S4.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.2" xref="S4.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml">A</mi><mi id="S4.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.3" xref="S4.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml">p</mi></msub><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S4.SS2.p1.1.m1.1b"><apply id="S4.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S4.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1">subscript</csymbol><ci id="S4.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S4.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.2">𝐴</ci><ci id="S4.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S4.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.3">𝑝</ci></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S4.SS2.p1.1.m1.1c">A_{p}</annotation></semantics></math>), while others are marked as true negative anchors (<math id="S4.SS2.p1.2.m2.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="A_{n}^{t}" display="inline"><semantics id="S4.SS2.p1.2.m2.1a"><msubsup id="S4.SS2.p1.2.m2.1.1" xref="S4.SS2.p1.2.m2.1.1.cmml"><mi id="S4.SS2.p1.2.m2.1.1.2.2" xref="S4.SS2.p1.2.m2.1.1.2.2.cmml">A</mi><mi id="S4.SS2.p1.2.m2.1.1.2.3" xref="S4.SS2.p1.2.m2.1.1.2.3.cmml">n</mi><mi id="S4.SS2.p1.2.m2.1.1.3" xref="S4.SS2.p1.2.m2.1.1.3.cmml">t</mi></msubsup><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S4.SS2.p1.2.m2.1b"><apply id="S4.SS2.p1.2.m2.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS2.p1.2.m2.1.1"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S4.SS2.p1.2.m2.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS2.p1.2.m2.1.1">superscript</csymbol><apply id="S4.SS2.p1.2.m2.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S4.SS2.p1.2.m2.1.1"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S4.SS2.p1.2.m2.1.1.2.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS2.p1.2.m2.1.1">subscript</csymbol><ci id="S4.SS2.p1.2.m2.1.1.2.2.cmml" xref="S4.SS2.p1.2.m2.1.1.2.2">𝐴</ci><ci id="S4.SS2.p1.2.m2.1.1.2.3.cmml" xref="S4.SS2.p1.2.m2.1.1.2.3">𝑛</ci></apply><ci id="S4.SS2.p1.2.m2.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S4.SS2.p1.2.m2.1.1.3">𝑡</ci></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S4.SS2.p1.2.m2.1c">A_{n}^{t}</annotation></semantics></math>).

This scheme significantly enhances the likelihood of discovering true objects, allowing for a more accurate distinction between potential novel unseen class objects and coarse negative anchors. Consequently, the ternary RPN enables the model to maintain its ability to identify novel objects from previously unseen classes. In practice, not all potential objects that exist in training datasets are necessarily identified during training and only a subset of them may be detected. Nonetheless, the novel unseen class objects that have been successfully isolated by this process can still help to reduce confusion in few-shot learning due to their dissimilarity to the known classes.
We use these identified objects along with contrastive learning to equip the model with the capability of distinguishing them.</p>

<p id="S4.SS3.p1.3" class="ltx_p">We noted that sample imbalance can be particularly significant in the RPN layer. To investigate this possibility, we calculated the number of foreground and background proposals generated by the RPN of a standard Faster R-CNN network, and the result indicates that the ratio of foreground over background proposals is around 0.17. This number indicates that the background proposals dominate the objectness loss. Consequently, proposals are more likely to be classified as background. Therefore, we suppose that a contrastive learning loss is necessary to address the challenge of objectness confusion.

The features of proposals are encoded as a 128-dimensional default feature vector, and then cosine similarity scores are calculated between each pair of proposals to compute the contrastive learning loss. Those sample pairs with higher cosine similarity that do not belong to the same category will need to have a higher contrastive loss value, and vice versa, to enforce making them more distant in the feature space. In this manner, the HTRPN would assign higher objectness scores to the proposals.</p>

The evaluation scheme strictly follows the same paradigm as described in TFA <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite> to enable comparison with results reported in other works on FSOD. To ensure a fair comparison, when training the base class, we adhere to the TFA <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite> and FSCE <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite> guidelines and utilize the official ImageNet pre-trained model. The contrastive learning head in the fine-tuning stage is computed similarly to FSCE <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>. In the evaluation protocol, a two-fold approach is employed to assess the performance of our model. Specifically, we calculate the mean average precision (mAP50) for each category in the dataset, using both the base classes (bAP50) and the novel seen class (nAP50). The AP50 value indicates the average precision (AP) at an IoU (Intersection over Union) threshold of 0.5, which means that the model detects objects with an IoU of 0.5 or higher from the ground truth. We repeat the experiments five times and report the average values.</p>

Due to the differences in feature spaces between pre-training and fine-tuning samples, the weights of the contrastive learning modules used for RPN and RoI pooling cannot be transferred from the pre-trained model to the fine-tuning tasks. Therefore, we remove these weights from the pre-trained model and unfreeze the weights of the ResNet backbone and RoI pooling during fine-tuning training.</p>

<div id="S5.SS2.SSS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.SS2.SSS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The PASCAL VOC dataset is commonly used in computer vision for object detection.
It contains images from a variety of real-world scenes and encompasses a diverse set of object classes, making it suitable for evaluating the performance of algorithms designed to detect and classify objects within images. Each image in the dataset is annotated with bounding boxes that indicate the location of different objects, along with labels that specify the object’s class.
For FSOD using the PASCAL VOC 2007 and 2012 datasets, a set of 15 categories has been designated as the base classes for pre-training purposes, while the remaining 5 categories are designated as the novel seen classes. The division of categories aligns with the three distinct category splits introduced in the TFA <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>. To ensure a fair comparison, Wang et al.<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite> have defined three distinct combinations of the base and the novel seen classes, referred to as split1, split2, and split3.
Across each of these category splits, we conduct evaluations by measuring the average precision for novel classes (referred to as nAP) at different few-shot learning levels, namely 1, 2, 3, 5, and 10 shots. The training iterations comprises 8000 iterations per training epoch, with an initial learning rate set at 0.02.</p>

<p id="S5.SS2.SSS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The outcomes of our experiments are tabulated in Table <a href="#S5.T2" title="Table 2 ‣ 5.2.1 Results on PASCAL VOC ‣ 5.2 Comparison Results ‣ 5 Experimental Results ‣ Improved Region Proposal Network for Enhanced Few-Shot Object Detection" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>. We observe that no FSOD methods has the best performance under all situations and a FSOD method should be deemed a good method if it leads to a competitive performance across all cases.
Upon scrutiny of the results, we observe that the results for split3 surpass those of split1 and split2. Upon careful examination of the images, we think that this observation can be attributed to the relative simplicity of the background in split3. The backgrounds in split3 exhibit reduced complexity, rendering them more amenable to our analysis compared to the intricate backgrounds encountered in split1 and split2 that makes FSOD less vulnerable with respect to instances of unseen novel classes.
Furthermore, we undertake a thorough comparative study between our obtained results and an in-house implementation of the FSCE. Our empirical investigation reveals that our proposed method has outperformed this method, implying that our approach is not only more efficacious but also more resource-efficient compared to the original FSCE method.
In conclusion, we find that our proposed approach consistently enhances performance across a variety of scenarios. Notably, our method demonstrates pronounced efficacy when dealing with scenarios involving a smaller number of shots (<math id="S5.SS2.SSS1.p2.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="n" display="inline"><semantics id="S5.SS2.SSS1.p2.1.m1.1a"><mi id="S5.SS2.SSS1.p2.1.m1.1.1" xref="S5.SS2.SSS1.p2.1.m1.1.1.cmml">n</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S5.SS2.SSS1.p2.1.m1.1b"><ci id="S5.SS2.SSS1.p2.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S5.SS2.SSS1.p2.1.m1.1.1">𝑛</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S5.SS2.SSS1.p2.1.m1.1c">n</annotation></semantics></math> shots).</p>

<p id="S5.SS2.SSS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">For the COCO dataset, a total of 60 categories are chosen to serve as the base classes for our pre-training stage. The remaining subset of 20 categories is designated as the novel seen classes for few-shot learning. Throughout the training phase, we employ 20,000 training iterations, with the initial learning rate set at 0.01 to guide the optimization process. We assess the Average Precision (AP) under two scenarios of 10-shot and 30-shot learning. The performance results d are documented in Table <a href="#S5.T3" title="Table 3 ‣ 5.2.2 Results on the COCO Dataset ‣ 5.2 Comparison Results ‣ 5 Experimental Results ‣ Improved Region Proposal Network for Enhanced Few-Shot Object Detection" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a>.
Once again, we observe that our proposed method consistently outperforms the prior methods. Notably, in the case of 30-shot learning the extent of improvement achieved by our method is notably substantial which shows that our method is able to separate instances of novel unseen classes better. We conclude that our approach is helpful to improve FSOD performance.</p>

To this end, we conducted an ablation study experiment on the PASCAL VOC dataset using the 5-shot setting. This study helps analyzing the impact of each component and understand their overall contribution to the model’s performance. Each proposed module is sequentially added to the base network in a cumulative manner, allowing us to analyze their individual and combined effects on the overall performance of the network.

By conducting these comparisons, we aim to assess the effectiveness of our method in terms of its ability toaccurately and efficiently encode features for FSOD tasks. The reported values are based on the pre-training of the PASCAL VOC dataset and a 5-shot fine-tuning scenarios. We observe that our method primarily takes effect during the training process without significantly affecting the inference stage, which ensures that our method does not slow down the inference speed .Our algorithm also minimizes any potential interference between the training and inference stages. By focusing on these two distinct phases of the process, we are able to deliver an efficient and effective solution for the FSOD tasks compared to FSCE despite using a larger model.</p>

The negative anchors (blue bars) form the majority, and the number of active anchors (orange bars) are around 0 to 50 for each iteration, which translates into about 4% of all anchors. However, the number of potential anchors (gray bars) converges with training iterations and stays at around 0 to 5 for each iteration. This observation indicates our model is getting more stable for recognizing the potential novel objects as more training iterations are performed. Furthermore, as shown in Figure. <a href="#S5.F8.sf2" title="In Figure 8 ‣ 5.3.5 Magnitude of Potential Novel Objects ‣ 5.3 Ablative and Analytic Experiments ‣ 5 Experimental Results ‣ Improved Region Proposal Network for Enhanced Few-Shot Object Detection" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">8(b)</span></a>, during 5-shot fine-tuning, the trend of the potential anchors is similar to the pre-training stage. However, when transferring to novel classes, the pre-trained model tends to predict some labeled seen novel objects as potential unseen novel objects at the beginning of the fine-tuning stage, which could be considered as the inertia of the pre-trained model. Although the number of potential anchors is relatively high in the first several iterations of training, our training procedure mitigates this problem. This observation also supports our hypothesis that all true/potential positive ternary objectness of anchors should be presented by the combination of <math id="S5.SS3.SSS5.p1.3.m3.1" class="ltx_Math"

<p id="S5.SS3.SSS6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Successful FSOD would be feasible in our archtecture, if the extracted features by HTRPN describe the classes well, i.e., representations for data points that belong two the same class become separated from the rest of classes. To study this aspect, Figure. <a href="#S5.F9" title="Figure 9 ‣ 5.3.5 Magnitude of Potential Novel Objects ‣ 5.3 Ablative and Analytic Experiments ‣ 5 Experimental Results ‣ Improved Region Proposal Network for Enhanced Few-Shot Object Detection" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">9</span></a> shows the t-SNE visualization of clustering of our model for the split1 5-shot scenario of the PASCAL VOC dataset. In this figure, we can observe the clusters formed by the algorithm and the corresponding color for each data point indicates its label. We can see that separated clusters are formed, where each one represents a different class in the dataset. A denser cluster indicates smaller intra-class distance and better recognition ability of its category because larger margins make the model robust with respect to domain shift.
The t-SNE visualization indicates that our model exhibits a commendable ability to cluster distinct categories, demonstrating its effectiveness in identifying and separating them for FSOD.</p>

<div id="S6.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We identified and addressed an unexplored challenge for FSOD.
Our proposed architecture enhances the quality of FSOD model by improving the R-CNN-based architecture. Our approach focused on addressing the challenge of objectness inconsistency due to potential unlabeled novel objects that belong to unseen classes. By studying this phenomenon, we were able to improve the accuracy and robustness of the base FSOD model. We implemented a balance anchor sampling strategy to improve the ability of the model to identify anchors that may contain objects from unseen classes. In addition, we proposed HTRPN which leads to the recognition ability of potential novel objects and further enhances the objectness consistency. As our results demonstrate, this approach can mitigate model confusion about the novel classes and lead to noticeable improvements in the object detection performance, and we are excited. Future research includes extensions of our idea to identify novel unseen classes in a zero-shot learning setting to address a similar challenge.</p>
