<p id="id5.id1" class="ltx_p">Object detection is an essential and fundamental task in computer vision and satellite image processing. Existing deep learning methods have achieved impressive performance thanks to the availability of large-scale annotated datasets. Yet, in real-world applications the availability of labels is limited. In this context, few-shot object detection (FSOD) has emerged as a promising direction, which aims at enabling the model to detect novel objects with only few of them annotated. However, many existing FSOD algorithms overlook a critical issue:
when an input image contains multiple novel objects and only a subset of them are annotated,
the unlabeled objects will be considered as background during training.
This can cause confusions and severely impact the model’s ability to recall novel objects.
To address this issue, we propose a self-training-based FSOD (ST-FSOD) approach, which incorporates the self-training mechanism into the few-shot fine-tuning process. ST-FSOD aims to enable the discovery of novel objects that are not annotated, and take them into account during training.
On the one hand, we devise a two-branch region proposal networks (RPN) to separate the proposal extraction of base and novel objects, On another hand, we incorporate the student-teacher mechanism into <span id="id5.id1.1" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">RPN and the region of interest (RoI) head</span> to include those highly confident yet unlabeled targets as pseudo labels.
Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art in various FSOD settings by a large margin. The codes will be publicly available at <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/zhu-xlab/ST-FSOD" title="" class="ltx_ref ltx_url ltx_font_typewriter">https://github.com/zhu-xlab/ST-FSOD</a>.</p>

Let’s consider a scenario where our goal is detecting the presence of a ”plane” as the novel class object, and we are provided with just one bounding box annotation for a plane.
As depicted in the figure,
the challenge arises when multiple instances of planes are present within a single image,
In such cases, some of the planes within the image are left unannotated.
This can mislead the detector since RPN loss and bounding box classification loss are calculated based on these incomplete annotations.

<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Object detection (OD) is a critical task in computer vision as well as remote sensing image processing, which enables the automatic identification and localization of objects of interest within an image.
With the rapid development of deep learning techniques <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite> and the emergence of large-scale human-annotated data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>, the performance of the state-of-the-art OD approaches has been pushed to a new stage. These approaches have achieved remarkable success in detecting objects in various domains, including remote sensing <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>. However, traditional OD methods rely on a large amount of labeled data for training, which can be challenging and time-consuming to obtain in remote sensing image processing, particularly in scenarios where novel or rare objects are involved.</p>

Few-shot learning achieves this by leveraging knowledge acquired from previously seen categories to adapt and recognize novel objects efficiently.

In the conventional FSOD framework, the model undergoes a two-stage training process: first, it is trained on a large-scale labeled dataset consisting of base objects, and subsequently, it is fine-tuned on a fine-tuning set with only a few labeled novel object instances. </span></p>

when there are multiple novel objects in a single image, it is possible that only a part of them are provided with labels during the fine-tuning stage.
As a result, these incomplete annotations can negatively impact the training towards novel classes and hinder the discovery of novel objects.
This issue, illustrated in Fig. <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ I Introduction ‣ Few-shot Object Detection in Remote Sensing: Lifting the Curse of Incompletely Annotated Novel Objects" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>, can be referred as the incompletely annotated novel objects (IANO) issue.</span></p>

it still remains unexplored in remote sensing.
However, objects in the remote sensing images are usually smaller,
and scenes often exhibit higher levels of congestion,
particularly in contexts with vehicles, planes, ships, and so on.
This phenomenon can be readily observed from different OD datasets tailored for remote sensing applications <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>.
As a result,
the IANO problem takes on an even more formidable and pressing nature when considered in the context of remote sensing.

A promising solution that emerges for mitigating this concern is self-training,
a well-established technique in the field of domain adaptation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>, <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>, <a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite> and semi-supervised learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>.</span>
This type of methods first generate pseudo labels on unlabeled data using a pre-trained model and then fine-tune the model using these pseudo labels.
<span id="S1.p6.1.2" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">The underlying philosophy of <em id="S1.p6.1.2.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">generating pseudo labels and leveraging the unlabeled data</em> aligns with our objective of identifying potential unannotated novel objects,
as they are hidden in the background and remain unannotated.

In the first stage,
a region proposal networks (RPN) is used to generate a set of candidate object proposals, each with a corresponding objectness score and a bounding box regression score.
In the second stage,
the candidate object proposals are refined and classified using a fully-connected layer network, also known as a Region of Interest (RoI) pooling layer <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite>.</p>

In these two modules,
a momentum-based teacher-student modeling strategy <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite> is used to filter out highly confident potential novel class objects and refine the loss calculation.
More specifically, the ST-RPN module uses the teacher-student modeling strategy to filter out highly confident proposals for potential novel classes. Meanwhile, the ST-BBH module filters out highly confident novel bounding boxes. Both modules refine the loss calculation to improve the accuracy of the detection model.

<p id="S2.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Object detection refers to identifying and localizing objects within an image, which has been one of the main research tasks in computer vision (CV). Traditional OD techniques are based on, e.g. feature extraction <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite>, object recognition, and template matching <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite>. State-of-the-art OD techniques are mostly based on deep learning, owing to its overwhelming performance on large-scale object detection benchmarks. Deep learning-based OD methods utilize convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to perform object detection directly from raw image pixels, without the need for hand-crafted feature engineering. They can be categorized into two-stage and single-stage detectors. While two-stage detectors aim to first generate object proposals and then classify them, single-stage detectors perform both tasks simultaneously. A typical example of two-stage detectors is Faster R-CNN <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>, which generates a set of region proposals and then extracts features from each proposal using a Region of Interest (RoI) pooling layer before classifying the object within the proposal. One well-known single-stage detector is YOLO <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>, which applies a CNN to the entire image to simultaneously predict bounding boxes and class probabilities for each object without any proposal generation step.</p>

<p id="S2.SS2.SSS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Meta-learning based methods are designed to learn quickly from a few examples, using a meta-learner that has been trained on a diverse set of tasks.

These coefficients are based on the support samples and allow the model to effectively learn the intrinsic importance of features for detecting objects. This enables the re-weighting coefficients of novel classes to be learned with only a few support examples.</p>

They address this challenge by introducing a distractor utilization loss.
More specifically, for each annotated bounding box, a cropped image centered at the object will be fed into a few-shot correction network. This network generate corresponding pseudo labels, which are subsequently used to identify potential novel objects and adjust the loss calculation with respect tothe Region of Interest (RoI) head.
On a similar note, Qiao et al. </span><cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><span id="S2.SS5.p1.1.5.1" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">[</span><a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a><span id="S2.SS5.p1.1.6.2" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">]</span></cite><span id="S2.SS5.p1.1.7" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;"> emphasize that the IANO issue also exists when multiple novel objects were present within a single image. To resolve this concern, they propose a label calibration method. This method recalibrated the predicted targets of background objects based on their predicted confidences.

Specifically, when calculating the RPN loss, the incompleteness of novel object annotations could cause the RPN to mistakenly predict unannotated novel objects as background, thereby reducing overall performance.
In our method, we propose a comprehensive approach to mitigate the IANO issue. We apply advanced self-training techniques not only to the bounding box classification head but also to the RPN.
By doing so, we extend our efforts to tackle this challenge on a broader scale, addressing the impact of unannotated objects throughout the entire object detection pipeline.

<p id="S3.SS3.p3.1" class="ltx_p">The separation of base and novel proposals has two benefits. First, during fine-tuning, the pre-trained weights obtained from the base training stage could be negatively affected, which can impact the quality of the extracted base proposals. Separating proposal extraction prevents the fine-tuning towards novel objects from biasing the extraction of base proposals. Second, previous FSOD works in remote sensing <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>]</cite> have found that the RPN module achieved from the base training stage often fails to recall novel objects successfully. Thus, training an additional RPN module from scratch can lead to a better network state in terms of novel object detection.</p>

<p id="S3.SS4.p1.3" class="ltx_p">In the proposed framework, the extracted base and novel proposals are merged and passed through a RoI pooling layer and a RoI feature extraction layer to obtain the corresponding RoI features. These features are then forwarded to the self-training bounding box head (ST-BBH) for achieving the final detection results.
The ST-BBH consists of a teacher and a student bounding box heads (BBH). Each BBH contains a bounding box classifier and a regressor, following the same architecture as the one proposed in Faster R-CNN <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite>.
While processing each RoI, the feature is input to both the teacher and student classifier heads.
In order to improve the robustness, the student head receives the feature with dropout <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib50" title="" class="ltx_ref">50</a>]</cite> applied as the input.

This teacher module maintains a slowly updated copy of the original module, ensuring stable yet recent targets (or pseudo-labels) for model updates, as discussed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite>.
However, it’s important to note that ST-RPN and ST-BBH are technically distinct: ST-RPN is employed to extract class-agnostic proposals, while ST-BBH is specifically designed for the classification and regression of class-specific bounding boxes.
Furthermore, we emphasize that in ST-RPN, we explicitly separate the extraction of base and novel proposals, whereas in ST-BBH, the classification and regression heads for both base and novel classes share the same ROI features.

<div id="S4.SS3.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS3.p2.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S4.SS3.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">On the NWPU-VHR10 v2 dataset, our method attains state-of-the-art performance in both 3 and 20-shot settings, surpassing the second-best results by a notable margin ranging from 3% to 7%. Additionally, it performs comparably to state-of-the-art models in the 5 and 10-shot settings.</span></p>

<p id="S4.SS3.p3.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S4.SS3.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">Regarding the DIOR dataset, as shown in Table <a href="#S4.T2" title="TABLE II ‣ IV-B Implementation Details ‣ IV Experiments ‣ Few-shot Object Detection in Remote Sensing: Lifting the Curse of Incompletely Annotated Novel Objects" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">II</span></a>, our method consistently outperforms the second-best approach by a substantial margin of 5% to 7%.

Remarkably, our results in split 1 demonstrate improvements exceeding 10%.</span></p>
</div>
<div id="S4.SS3.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS3.p4.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S4.SS3.p4.1.1" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">On the iSAID dataset, our proposed method delivers significant enhancements, ranging from 5% to over 10%. These improvements remain consistent across various splits and different numbers of shots.</span></p>
</div>
<div id="S4.SS3.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS3.p5.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S4.SS3.p5.1.1" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">These results not only demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method but also underscore the significance of addressing the issue of incompletely annotated novel objects.
It is worth noting that performance variance tends to be higher in cases with fewer shots, suggesting that FSOD performance is somewhat sensitive to the sampling of annotated novel objects, especially when the available shots are limited.

This issue becomes particularly pronounced in scenarios featuring multiple small objects within a single image.
For instance, in the first column of Fig. <a href="#S4.F4" title="Figure 4 ‣ IV-B Implementation Details ‣ IV Experiments ‣ Few-shot Object Detection in Remote Sensing: Lifting the Curse of Incompletely Annotated Novel Objects" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a>, ships can be easily mistaken as part of the background by a few-shot object detector. This occurs because, during the few-shot fine-tuning stage, a significant number of ship annotations will be missing, as depicted in Fig. <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ I Introduction ‣ Few-shot Object Detection in Remote Sensing: Lifting the Curse of Incompletely Annotated Novel Objects" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>.
In contrast to this, our detection results show demonstrate that our method excels in recalling many ship objects.
This verify the effectiveness of employing self-training technique to solve the IANO issue.</span></p>

<p id="S4.I1.i2.p1.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S4.I1.i2.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">By separating the proposals for base and novel class objects, our approach effectively preserves the performance of the few-shot detector on the base class.
As elaborated in Section <a href="#S3.SS3" title="III-C Self-training-based Region Proposal Networks ‣ III Methods ‣ Few-shot Object Detection in Remote Sensing: Lifting the Curse of Incompletely Annotated Novel Objects" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag"><span class="ltx_text">III-C</span></span></a>, this separation of region proposals serves to prevent the few-shot fine-tuning process from negatively influence the detection of base class objects.
As evidenced by the results depicted in the 5th column of Fig. <a href="#S4.F4" title="Figure 4 ‣ IV-B Implementation Details ‣ IV Experiments ‣ Few-shot Object Detection in Remote Sensing: Lifting the Curse of Incompletely Annotated Novel Objects" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a> and the 3rd column of Fig. <a href="#S4.F5" title="Figure 5 ‣ IV-B Implementation Details ‣ IV Experiments ‣ Few-shot Object Detection in Remote Sensing: Lifting the Curse of Incompletely Annotated Novel Objects" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5</span></a>,
our method is able to detect challenging, small base class objects such as storage tanks and vehicles.</span></p>

This decline in performance stems from the fact that this particular strategy employs only a limited subset of base class annotations for model fine-tuning, leading to incomplete annotations for the base class.

One possible reason is that since the base and novel classes share the same bounding box head (BBH), the fine-tuning on novel objects affects the general feature extraction within BBH and further affects the detection of base classes. However, there is a consistent improvement on the novel classes after applying ST-BBH, ranging from 3% to even 10%, at different number of shots.</p>

The second row shows that using the ST-RPN module helps to recall more large vehicle objects. However, using ST-RPN alone without ST-BBH may lead to a higher false positive rate, as can be seen from the first row. By combining the ST-RPN and ST-BBH, the best visualization quality is achieved. The third row demonstrates that this combination can help to detect small ship objects with high accuracy. These results further demonstrate the significance of incorporating the self-training mechanism to solve the unlabeled novel object issue.</p>

<p id="S4.SS7.p1.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S4.SS7.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">To assess the incremental computational demands introduced by our two proposed modules, ST-RPN and ST-BBH, we conducted an evaluation based on training times (measured in seconds per iteration) during the fine-tuning stage and inference frames per second (FPS) when these modules were integrated.
The outcomes, as illustrated in Table </span><a href="#S4.T7" title="TABLE VII ‣ IV-D Qualitative Results ‣ IV Experiments ‣ Few-shot Object Detection in Remote Sensing: Lifting the Curse of Incompletely Annotated Novel Objects" class="ltx_ref" style="color:#000000;"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">VII</span></a><span id="S4.SS7.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">, indicate that the inclusion of ST-BBH results in a negligible computational overhead, both during training and inference phases. This outcome aligns with our expectations, as ST-BBH simply introduces a pair of additional bounding box regressor and classifier layers on top of the Region of Interest (RoI) features.

<div id="S4.SS7.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS7.p2.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S4.SS7.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">In contrast, the integration of ST-RPN introduces a more substantial computational load during the training phase.
However, it is crucial to note that the fine-tuning phase in FSOD algorithms typically involves significantly fewer iterations compared to the base training phase (see our settings in Section </span><a href="#S4.SS2" title="IV-B Implementation Details ‣ IV Experiments ‣ Few-shot Object Detection in Remote Sensing: Lifting the Curse of Incompletely Annotated Novel Objects" class="ltx_ref" style="color:#000000;"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag"><span class="ltx_text">IV-B</span></span></a><span id="S4.SS7.p2.1.2" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">).
As such, the additional training costs remain within acceptable bounds.
Furthermore, while ST-RPN does marginally reduce inference speed, it is essential to consider this cost in light of the performance gains it offers. This expense is manageable given the corresponding boost in detection performance.
Additionally, upon closer investigation, we found that a substantial portion of the computational cost introduced by ST-RPN is attributed to the additional bounding box operations, such as non-maximum suppression (NMS).
These options can be optimized and accelerated through the utilization of CUDA implementations.

<p id="S4.SS8.p1.1" class="ltx_p">To gain a better understanding of the limitations of the proposed FSOD method, we visualize some failure cases in different FSOD settings, as shown in Fig. <a href="#S4.F7" title="Figure 7 ‣ IV-E Ablation Studies ‣ IV Experiments ‣ Few-shot Object Detection in Remote Sensing: Lifting the Curse of Incompletely Annotated Novel Objects" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">7</span></a>.
Based on the figure, we can observe that the majority of the missed detections are primarily due to the small size of the objects <span id="S4.SS8.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">(“ships” in the 3rd column)</span>, or objects with large size variance compared to the training data <span id="S4.SS8.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">(“ships” in the second column)</span>. Additionally, there may be duplicated detected boxes for objects that lack clear boundaries, such as the <span id="S4.SS8.p1.1.3" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">“tennis court” in the 1st column or “soccerball field” in the 4th column</span>.
While these issues are prevalent in general object detection <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib64" title="" class="ltx_ref">64</a>]</cite>, improved techniques related to addressing them can also be utilized to enhance the performance of FSOD.</p>

<div id="S5.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we analyzed the current FSOD setting for remote sensing and identified the issue of <span id="S5.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">incompletely annotated novel objects</span> that can negatively impact the performance of FSOD methods. To address this issue, we propose to incorporate the self-training mechanism into the classical two-stage fine-tuning based FSOD pipeline. Our approach includes a ST-RPN module, which generates a set of novel proposals by excluding some proposals from the loss calculation that are likely to be novel objects but cannot be assigned to an existing few-shot annotation. Additionally, we designed a ST-BBH module that leverages the pseudo labels generated from a teacher BBH to filter out potential novel bounding boxes that are unlabeled and use them to supervise the student BBH to recall more novel objects.</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p2.1" class="ltx_p">While our proposed method significantly improved the novel class FSOD performance in remote sensing, the base class performance may slightly decrease compared to the base model. Future works could focus on designing a generalized FSOD method that prevents the model from forgetting the previously learned base knowledge while improving the performance in detecting novel classes.</p>
