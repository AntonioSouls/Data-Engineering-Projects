<p id="id2.id1" class="ltx_p">The task of estimating the 6D pose of an object from RGB images can be broken down into two main steps: an initial pose estimation step, followed by a refinement procedure to correctly register the object and its observation.
In this paper, we propose a new method for 6D pose estimation refinement from RGB images.
To achieve high accuracy of the final estimate, the observation and a rendered model need to be aligned.
Our main insight is that after the initial pose estimate, it is important to pay attention to distinct spatial features of the object in order to improve the estimation accuracy during alignment.
Furthermore, parts of the object that are occluded in the image should be given less weight during the alignment process.
Most state-of-the-art refinement approaches do not allow for this fine-grained reasoning and can not fully leverage the structure of the problem.
In contrast, we propose a novel neural network architecture built around a spatial attention mechanism that identifies and leverages information about spatial details during pose refinement. We experimentally show that this approach learns to attend to salient spatial features and learns to ignore occluded parts of the object, leading to better pose estimation across datasets.
We conduct experiments on standard benchmark datasets for 6D pose estimation (LineMOD and Occlusion LineMOD) and outperform previous state-of-the-art methods.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Detecting objects in images and estimating their pose from 2D images is one of the core problems in computer vision and has many applications in downstream tasks.
With the advent of deep learning approaches, rapid progress on the task of object detection has been achieved (e.g., YOLO <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>, Fast R-CNN <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>, and Mask R-CNN <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>).
However, for applications such as robotic manipulation, augmented reality and autonomous driving, it is essential to recover the full 6D pose of the object.
To solve this challenging task, a variety of methods such as BB8 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>, PoseCNN <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite>, PVNet <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite> and DPOD <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite> have been proposed recently. The 6D pose estimation task is typically separated into two subtasks: initial detection and pose estimation of objects from raw images <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>, <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite> and subsequent pose refinement <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>, <a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite>. With modern CNN architectures, the one-shot pose estimation sub-task has saturated somewhat <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>, <a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>, <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>, <a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite> but such methods have not yet been able to precisely align spatial details, leaving much room for improvement via iterative pose refinement, which is the focus of our work.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Traditionally initial pose estimation and refinement, often via the iterative closest point (ICP) algorithm, have been treated separately.
More recently, several methods <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>, <a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite> address the refinement problem using deep learning approaches, leading to superior performance compared to ICP refinement.
The DPOD refiner <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite> leverages a pre-trained ResNet model <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite> and leverages it for 6D pose refinement in a non-iterative fashion.
DeepIM <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite> utilizes an iterative strategy to refine the prediction through several stages.
While achieving good accuracy neither of these methods explicitly leverages existing structure of the alignment process. For example, accurate alignment of 3D model and 2D image observation requires consideration of high-frequency spatial features. It has also been shown that excluding occlusions from the input data leads to more accurate predictions <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>. However, existing pose refinement approaches do not explicitly take this into consideration.</p>

<figcaption class="ltx_caption ltx_centering"><span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_figure">Figure 1: </span>Iterative pose refinement. The goal of the refinement process is to align the model and the input image. At each iteration stage, we focus on aligning a different feature. At the first iteration, we align top edges; at the second, we align the front point of the driller; at the third, we scale the model to cover non-overlapping details. This results in perfect alignment.</figcaption>
</figure>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">To address this issue we propose a novel deep neural network architecture that learns to consider fine-grained spatial details and learns to reason about occlusions in the scene.
An important insight is that a small number of pixels are sufficient to align the model to the input image. Humans would perform this task by first aligning some characteristic feature, for example, corners of the object. Then, geometric detail is leveraged to adjust for scale and the entire process would be repeated iteratively, by focusing on details that most reliably show the displacement (see Fig. <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ Spatial Attention Improves Iterative 6D Object Pose Estimation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>).
Inspired by this scheme, SoA methods for one-shot pose estimation rely on RANSAC to extract the most reliable points for prediction <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>, <a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite>.
We also leverage the idea that a small number of specific features is important for alignment, but we use an attention mechanism to learn to identify these automatically. We introduce an attention model that isolates reliable features, while rejecting the clutter. This makes the entire pipeline differentiable and allows for application of the inlier features to direct pose refinement which would not be possible via RANSAC. Furthermore, a fully differentiable approach allows for fine-tuning of the pose estimator for a given downstream task.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">When overlaying the image and the rendered prediction, similar points from real and rendered images lie nearby. Therefore, a spatial attention mechanism can be learned to identify the details which give the best position estimation if the final registration error is backpropagated through the entire network. As we experimentally show in Sec. <a href="#S5.SS6" title="5.6 Analysis of the Attention Model ‣ 5 Results ‣ Spatial Attention Improves Iterative 6D Object Pose Estimation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5.6</span></a>, the attention mechanism focuses on object outlines, which contain a lot of discriminative details. Outline edges are a common choice for ICP-based refinement from RGB images. We use a soft attention mechanism, similar to <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>, which results in a fully differentiable approach that can be trained using standard loss functions. As a feature extracting backbone, we use U-shaped DenseNet from <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>. DenseNet produces good results even when trained on small datasets and its U-shaped variant shows excellent performance on the semantic segmentation task. This task requires correctly classifying small details, which is also useful in our task because the attention needs to detect particular details. We test our approach in the single-stage and iterative approach settings. The iterative approach enables the attention to specialize for specific details in each iteration. This leads to state-of-the-art performance on the standard datasets for 6D pose estimation.</p>

<div id="S2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The task of 6D pose estimation has been a long-standing problem in Computer Vision. Early methods <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite> mostly rely on RGB-D images because it is possible to recover scale via depth information. The most popular dataset for evaluation of methods has been LineMOD <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>. However, the LineMOD dataset does not contain occluded test objects. When the object is occluded, it is much harder to distinguish between the object of interest and occlusions. Thus, the accuracy of estimation on occlusion data is far below the non-occluded case <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>, <a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite>. The most popular dataset for evaluation on the occlusion task has been Occlusion LineMOD <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Depth information is crucial to recover the scale of the object since the scale is hard to recover from RGB images due to perspective projection. Therefore, 6D pose estimation from RGB images is an even more challenging problem. With the advent of deep learning approaches, 6D pose estimation purely from RGB images got more attention. The majority of the methods focus on initial detection and pose estimation. Some methods such as <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite> rely on end-to-end approach, while other leverage the object detection pipelines <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>. However, more accurate approaches rely on keypoint prediction <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite> and compute pose via PnP algorithm <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>. State-of-the-art methods <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>, <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite> do not use hand-designed keypoints. They predict a correspondence map for every object pixel. Then the best minimal set of points is selected via the RANSAC algorithm. The 6D pose is computed via the PnP algorithm form the best set of points. It is essential to notice that selecting a specific set of points is more beneficial than using all available points. Methods that focus on the occlusion task, such as <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>, explicitly select regions that are not occluded via segmentation mask. Excluding pixels that are not part of the object of interest always results in higher accuracy.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">In the domain of pose refinement, the most common method is ICP. It is an optimization-based method that iteratively improves the position by minimizing the distance between the model features and image data. Usually, the cost function minimizes the distance between the point cloud generated from the depth channel and 3D points of the object model. In the case of RGB data, the cost function minimizes the distance between the edges in the image and that of the model. Recently, few deep learning approaches such as DeepIM <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite> and DPOD <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite> tackle the refinement task. Both approaches rely on pretrained models. DeepIM uses FlowNet <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite> as the base model, which is designed for two image inputs. DPOD modifies the ResNet <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite> architecture to feed in two images. Furthermore, DeepIM boosts the performance by iteratively improving the prediction. The main idea of both papers is to reuse the weights trained on big datasets and transfer it to the 6D pose estimation task. However, these methods do not leverage the structure of the problem. Contrary, papers for initial pose estimation use advanced techniques, such as RANSAC for keypoint selection <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite> or masking for removing occlusions <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p4.1" class="ltx_p">It has been shown that attention mechanisms improve the performance of deep neural network models in different domains such as machine translation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite>, visual recognition <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite>, object segmentation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>, tracking <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite> and generative models <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite>. The goal of attention mechanism is to extract the most relevant information form the feature vector. In the case of image data, a different attention map is applied for every query pixel separately <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite>, or the single attention map is used to extract global information <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>. Although all these attention mechanisms bear similarity, the attention mechanism dramatically depends on the domain where it is applied. For example, using the attention model to establish a connection between each pixel and the rest of the image shows the best results on image segmentation task <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>, while using a single attention map performs better on visual recognition tasks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>. In the 6D pose estimation area, the use of attention mechanisms has not been explored.</p>

Inspired by attention models in object detection and tracking <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>, we leverage an attention mechanism to improve the refinement of 6D pose estimation.
We show that the spatial attention mechanism leads to the rejection of pixels from occluded object parts. Furthermore, the attention focuses only on a few sub-regions with discriminative details, which leads to better pose estimation overall. Importantly, we train the model for the downstream task of 6D pose estimation and do not use any specific loss terms to train the attention mechanism.</p>

<p id="S3.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">At the initial step, we obtain the object pose from an existing one-shot pose estimation algorithm, such as PVNet <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>. Our goal is to refine this initial object pose. The inputs to our network are two RGB images: the image crop around the object of interest, and the object rendered at the initial pose estimate (see Fig. <a href="#S3.F2" title="Figure 2 ‣ 3 Method ‣ Spatial Attention Improves Iterative 6D Object Pose Estimation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>). To crop the image around the object, we project the object position to the image plane and select the crop area around the projection point. The rendered image provides initial pose information to the network. The main idea behind this setup is that the network learns to align these two images incrementally.</p>

<p id="S3.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">As the backbone of our model, we use DenseNet <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite> (see Fig. <a href="#S3.F2" title="Figure 2 ‣ 3 Method ‣ Spatial Attention Improves Iterative 6D Object Pose Estimation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>). More precisely, we leverage DenseNet variant designed for semantic segmentation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>. The model uses skip connections to preserve detailed information in the up-stream. In our case, this is important since the attention model needs to detect fine spatial details. We use the full down-stream of the model from <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite> and the first three blocks of the up-stream. Since the attention mechanism needs to identify image regions, we do not need the full resolution at the output. By using fewer layers we gain computational efficiency. Our backbone model already attains reasonable performance even when trained on the relatively small pose estimation datasets. This is due to the smaller number of parameters compared to ResNet <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite> or VGG <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite>.</p>

<p id="S3.SS1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Since our starting point is an initial pose guess, the images of rendered and real objects typically already lie close to each other in the image plane. Thus, related details are relatively close but are not yet aligned. Our goal is to perfectly align all details. However, not all object parts contribute equal amounts of information. For example, homogeneous surfaces do not provide useful information for alignment. Leveraging spatial attention allows the network to identify those areas in the image that, with high probability, contribute meaningfully to the alignment. In other words, it identifies salient details, while rejecting clutter, occluded parts of the object and non-informative uniformly textured parts of the object.</p>

<p id="S3.SS1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">We evaluate our approach in a single-stage and multi-stage settings. The single-stage setting takes the output of the network described above as a final result. In the multi-stage setting, we take the output of the network and update the object pose in each stage. The new object pose is used as input to the next stage. Therefore, we stack four modules shown in Fig. <a href="#S3.F2" title="Figure 2 ‣ 3 Method ‣ Spatial Attention Improves Iterative 6D Object Pose Estimation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a> into a sequence, which enables us to train the network for iterative refinement.

In the refinement methods, the initial poses during training are generated by adding random noise to the ground truth pose. The separate training loss for symmetric objects is not used because the initial pose is closest to the ground truth pose among all symmetric poses.

However, we do not use differentiable renderer functionality to backpropagate the gradients through the renderer.

<p id="S4.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We use the training data provided by the authors of PVNet, which consists of three datasets with objects from the LineMOD dataset. The first dataset contains real training data provided by the LineMOD dataset. The small number, roughly 1000 of images are sampled from the LineMOD sequences and are provided for training. The remainder of the dataset, around 13000 images, is used for testing only. However, this training dataset is too small to train deep neural networks. The second dataset contains 13000 synthetic images, 1000 for each object. To synthesize images, CAD models are rendered at different spatial positions, and the background and light sources are randomized. In this dataset, only a single object appears in the image without any occluders. The third dataset crops patches of LineMOD objects from real training data. These patches are then pasted over random backgrounds. When generating this dataset, multiple objects are placed in the same image, which can generate occlusions. This dataset contains 10000 images.</p>

Thus, we can simulate the test scenario by adding random noise to ground truth poses. To generate the second input to the network at training time, we render the object at a randomized initial position. The rendered images are generated on the fly via a differentiable renderer. We generate randomized initial positions by adding noise to the ground truth position and feed them to the differentiable renderer.</p>

<p id="S5.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">For evaluation, we use the standard ADD(-S) evaluation metric as is done in most 6D pose estimation papers <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>, <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>, <a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>.

<div id="S5.SS3.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We compare our model’s performance with the SoA 6D pose refiners DeepIM <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite> and DPOD <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite>. For DeepIM, we use the implementation provided by the authors. Since no publicly available implementation of DPOD exists, we use our own re-implementation, trained using the same data and randomization parameters as in our method. Moreover, we perform an ablation study to showcase the effect of the proposed attention model. To attain a baseline for the ablation, we train an additional model consisting of our backbone model, i.e., DenseNet <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>, and three output streams. In each output stream, we use two fully connected layers instead of the attention block. Since the ablation baseline does not predict attention maps, we use standard DenseNet instead of DenseNet for semantic segmentation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>. Standard DenseNet has the optimal structure for regression tasks. The ablation baseline has the same number of parameters as our model. For more details about our baseline model, please refer to supplementary materials.</p>

<div id="S5.SS3.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.SS3.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Clearly, the final pose estimate depends on the initial pose prediction. We use the SoA in the one-shot setting, PVNet <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>, for initialization. This allows for a comparison of refiners independently of the initialization method. Note that the settings reported in DPOD and DeepIM are incompatible (wrt to initialization), and hence we provide a new, directly comparable setting. The final performance of a refiner depends on the initialization (e.g., from PVNet). Thus, similar but not identical results, as reported in respective papers, are to be expected. On the LineMOD dataset, our baselines reach similar scores to ones reported in the original papers suggesting that our implementations are well tuned. On the Occlusion LineMOD dataset, the DPOD refiner performs slightly worse than reported in the paper. This is because in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite>, a part of the test sequence is used as training data, which makes the task easier. In the original Occlusion LineMOD settings <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>, the test sequence is not used for training. Both DeepIM <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite> and our work uses the original setting.</p>

For initialization, we use 6D poses obtained from PVNet (the performance of the initial poses is shown in the left-most column). Since the initialization points are different compared to the original papers, similar but not identical results are to be expected. Our method performs comparable or better than prior work and our DenseNet baseline for most objects and outperforms the SoA on average.</figcaption>

For each of the objects in the LineMOD dataset, we compute the ADD(-S) scores. The DPOD method is a single-stage refiner, while the DeepIM uses multiple stages. Thus, we train our model and the DenseNet baseline in both configurations.

Furthermore, the vanilla DenseNet performs better than both SoA refiners. This confirms our hypothesis that the DenseNet backbone is an effective substitute for the ResNet based architectures used in prior work, despite a much smaller footprint in terms of parameters. Finally, adding our proposed attention mechanism shows a consistent increase in performance over DenseNet, which confirms the effectiveness of the attention mechanism.</p>

The single-stage variant achieves a significant improvement over DenseNet. This is due to the attention map being shaped such that pixels of the occluder are ignored, which has been shown to improve accuracy <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>. The difference is more pronounced in the multi-stage case.</p>

Since the initialization points are different compared to the original papers, similar but not identical results are to be expected. The performance of DPOD method is slightly worse compared to the results reported in the paper due to the different training settings used in the DPOD paper (refer to Sec. <a href="#S5.SS3" title="5.3 Baselines ‣ 5 Results ‣ Spatial Attention Improves Iterative 6D Object Pose Estimation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5.3</span></a> for more details).

The refiner does not need to consider global features because the initial object pose is close to the ground truth pose. Global features need to be considered only in cases where initial displacement is significant. For example, if the initial rotation is around 180 degrees, the network needs to distinguish between the front and back of the object. Since the initial displacement is small, the network focuses on overlaying the characteristic features, which are usually located on the outline of the object. This is a somewhat expected result, since object outline edges are also a common choice for ICP-based refinement from RGB images.</p>

<div id="S5.SS6.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.SS6.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Second, we observe that the attention maps tend to get even more focused on specific regions in the later stages of refinement. As the pose estimate converges to the real image, only a few spatial features need to be considered to improve the prediction. Finally, we notice that the attention map avoids occluded object parts (see Fig. <a href="#S5.F4" title="Figure 4 ‣ 5.6 Analysis of the Attention Model ‣ 5 Results ‣ Spatial Attention Improves Iterative 6D Object Pose Estimation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a>, right). Please keep in mind that the attention map is learned without any direct supervision and is shaped only via directly optimizing the pose estimation task.</p>

<div id="S6.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we present a novel attention-based model method for 6D pose refinement. Our model uses an attention mechanism to recognize the regions containing details that give more accurate pose estimation. For the refinement task, details are more important than high-level features since the rendered model is already close to the goal pose. Thus, the network can focus on small pose increments by matching details of the model and input image. We experimentally show that the attention focuses on the outline regions, which contains plenty of discriminative details. In the ablation study, we demonstrate that the attention mechanism leads to performance improvement on different evaluation datasets and using different initialization poses. We experimentally show that our method leads to a significant improvement over SoA results.</p>
</div>
<div id="S6.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p2.1" class="ltx_p">To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time the attention mechanism is used for the 6D pose estimation task. Based on our experiments, we believe that the attention mechanism has particular importance for the task of 6D pose estimation. We hope that our insights will facilitate research in this direction. For example, one possibility is to use the attention mechanism for feature selection instead of the RANSAC algorithm. Furthermore, one can use attention to eliminate the influence of the occlusion object even in cases when the segmentation labels are not provided.</p>

<p id="S7.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Here we describe the architecture of our model and the DenseNet baseline in more details. The core of the DenseNet architecture is a Dense block <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>. The block uses convolutional layers of size 3x3. The input to the convolutional layer is first processed via batch normalization and ReLU activation. The main characteristic of the Dense block is that new features obtained from the latest convolutional layer are concatenated to the layer input and propagated further. As a result, DenseNet keeps the original features and only adds new features to the feature stack. Besides the Dense block, DenseNet has transition layers to reduce the resolution of the input features. We use a 2x2 max pooling layer with stride 2 as a transition layer.</p>

First, the features are upsampled in the up-stream via the transition layer that uses 3x3 transposed convolutions with stride 2. The network uses the skip connections to add features with the same spatial resolution from the down-stream to the upsampled features from the previous layer. These features are inputs to the up-stream Dense block. Since the spatial resolution increases, the network will require too much memory if we continue to concatenate the feature vectors. Thus, the output of the Dense block in the up-stream is modified (DB-up in Table <a href="#S7.T5" title="Table 5 ‣ 7.1 Model Details ‣ 7 Appendix ‣ Spatial Attention Improves Iterative 6D Object Pose Estimation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5</span></a>). The block output consists only of the features created in the current Dense block, i.e., the new features are not concatenated to the input features. In the up-stream, we can access upsampled features, down-stream features with the same resolution, and newly generated features. We use all these features as the input to the attention block.

We use regular DenseNet since the baseline directly predicts the rotation and translation parameters, and hence does not need to upscale feature vectors.
To have the same number of parameters in both models, we increase the number of layers Dense blocks 3, 4, and 5 (the Dense blocks with 14, 20, and 21 layers in Table <a href="#S7.T6" title="Table 6 ‣ 7.1 Model Details ‣ 7 Appendix ‣ Spatial Attention Improves Iterative 6D Object Pose Estimation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">6</span></a>). We choose these blocks since our model has more capacity at these resolutions. To obtain the strong ablation baseline, we experimented with the number and size of fully connected layers at the end of the networks. There was no improvement when we added more fully connected units or additional layers.</p>

Since all models are fully differentiable, the computation time depends on the neural network size. In single-stage settings, all methods run faster than 30 fps. Most of the modern cameras operate at 30 fps, and hence we can say that all methods operate in real-time. In the multi-stage setting, all methods operate at a similar frame rate. However, we show in the paper that our method outperforms all baseline methods. In conclusion, our method performs better without sacrificing computational time.</p>

<div id="S7.SS3.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S7.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In Fig. <a href="#S7.F5" title="Figure 5 ‣ 7.1 Model Details ‣ 7 Appendix ‣ Spatial Attention Improves Iterative 6D Object Pose Estimation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5</span></a>, we compare the attention maps of our model to the average feature activation of the DenseNet baseline. The resolution of our attention maps is the same as the resolution of the features in the Dense block with 14 layers in Table <a href="#S7.T6" title="Table 6 ‣ 7.1 Model Details ‣ 7 Appendix ‣ Spatial Attention Improves Iterative 6D Object Pose Estimation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">6</span></a>. Thus, we use the features at the output of this block. We compute per-pixel average values. DenseNet activation maps look very similar in all four stages of the multi-stage model. We show results from the first stages, but we can reach the same conclusions by comparing any of the stages.</p>
</div>
<div id="S7.SS3.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S7.SS3.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Similarly to the attention model, features activations have high values at object outlines. However, these are not the only regions where activations have high values. The activations are high at the background regions and even at the uniformly colored parts of the object (see driller example in Fig. <a href="#S7.F5" title="Figure 5 ‣ 7.1 Model Details ‣ 7 Appendix ‣ Spatial Attention Improves Iterative 6D Object Pose Estimation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5</span></a>). One can argue that deeper layers of DenseNet can potentially reject some of the clutter. However, deeper layers have lower resolutions, which prevents them from isolating fine-grained details. The attention network resolves this issue by enabling our model to isolate discriminative details at the high resolution. This leads to accuracy improvement, as we show in our paper.</p>

<div id="S7.SS4.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S7.SS4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this experiment, we compare our results to an additional ablation baseline. In the Sec. <a href="#S5" title="5 Results ‣ Spatial Attention Improves Iterative 6D Object Pose Estimation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5</span></a>, we use DenseNet as our ablation baseline because the downstream type of architecture is the most typical choice for a regression task. The features need to be squeezed into a one-dimensional vector to perform regression in the final part of the network. If we do not need access to low-level features, there is no reason to use the up-stream part of the network. In our model, we apply a spatial attention mechanism for feature selection, and thus we need the up-stream architecture. To confirm that the specific backbone details are not the main cause for performance improvement, we conduct an additional experiment. We trained a new ablation model, where we use the same U-DenseNet backbone as in our model. To obtain the new ablation baseline, we replace the attention block with fully connected layers. We use global average pooling to compute one-dimensional feature vectors for regression.</p>

By comparing the accuracies of the ablation baselines, i.e., the U-DenseNet and DenseNet baselines, we conclude that both models perform similarly. U-DenseNet performs slightly better compared to the DenseNet on the Occlusion LineMOD dataset. U-DenseNet has direct access to the not occluded low-level features, which is probably the cause of this difference. However, our approach performs significantly better compared to both ablation baselines, which confirms that the performance improvement is due to the attention module.</p>

<div id="S7.SS5.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S7.SS5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The multi-stage variant of our approach uses four stages. We follow the DeepIM paper in this regard. For a fair comparison, we use the same number of stages as the multi-stage baseline. To evaluate how our method performs with a different number of stages, we conduct additional experiments. In this experiment, we train our model using two and three stages and compare to the models evaluated in the main paper, i.e., the single-stage and four-stage models. We present the results in Table <a href="#S7.T9" title="Table 9 ‣ 7.4 U-DenseNet Ablation Baseline Experiment ‣ 7 Appendix ‣ Spatial Attention Improves Iterative 6D Object Pose Estimation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">9</span></a>.</p>

The models with one and two stages give the most significant improvements. The later stages still improve the results, but the relative improvement is smaller compared to the first two stages. From the improvement trend in Table <a href="#S7.T9" title="Table 9 ‣ 7.4 U-DenseNet Ablation Baseline Experiment ‣ 7 Appendix ‣ Spatial Attention Improves Iterative 6D Object Pose Estimation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">9</span></a>, we can conclude that adding more than four stages would improve the results but not significantly. It would be interesting to increase the number of stages to find the saturation point. However, this is not possible due to hardware limitations. We leave this for future work.</p>
