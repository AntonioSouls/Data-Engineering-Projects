<p class="ltx_p" id="2.1">We have developed a high-performance Chinese Chess AI that operates without reliance on search algorithms. This AI has demonstrated the capability to compete at a level commensurate with the top 0.1% of human players. By eliminating the search process typically associated with such systems, this AI achieves a Queries Per Second (QPS) rate that exceeds those of systems based on the Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm by over a thousandfold and surpasses those based on the AlphaBeta pruning algorithm by more than a hundredfold.
The AI training system consists of two parts: supervised learning and reinforcement learning. Supervised learning provides an initial human-like Chinese chess AI, while reinforcement learning, based on supervised learning, elevates the strength of the entire AI to a new level. Based on this training system, we carried out enough ablation experiments and discovered that 1. The same parameter amount of Transformer architecture has a higher performance than CNN on Chinese chess; 2. Possible moves of both sides as features can greatly improve the training process; 3. Selective opponent pool, compared to pure self-play training, results in a faster improvement curve and a higher strength limit. 4. Value Estimation with Cutoff(VECT) improves the original PPO algorithm training process and we will give the explanation.</p><button class="sr-only button" style="display: none;">Report issue for preceding element</button>

<p class="ltx_p" id="Sx1.p2.1">Chinese Chess, also known as Xiangqi, is a strategy board game for two players that share similarities with the international chess game. It is one of the most popular board games in China and has been played for centuries, boasting a complexity and strategic depth revered by enthusiast and scholar alike. The standard Xiangqi board is a 10x9 grid, with a distinctive feature—the river—that divides the two opposing camps and impacts piece movement.</p><button class="sr-only button" style="display: none;">Report issue for preceding element</button>

The mentioned pieces each have unique movement rules, such as the Elephant’s inability to cross the river and the Cannon’s requirement of a ’screen’ piece for capture. Victory is achieved by checkmating or stalemating the opponent’s General.</p><button class="sr-only button" style="display: none;">Report issue for preceding element</button>

<p class="ltx_p" id="Sx1.p5.1">Traditional Chinese Chess AI approaches have emphasized the use of alpha-beta pruning and other heuristic search methods—effective yet limited by the computational resources necessary to examine extensive game trees. Additionally, the algorithms require handcrafted evaluation functions that encapsulate human understanding of the game, which can be rigid and fail to adapt to novel situations.</p><button class="sr-only button" style="display: none;">Report issue for preceding element</button>

However, applying these methods to Chinese Chess AI confronts two main challenges: one is the efficient encoding of game states in a way that preserves the rich context and enables the neural network to assess board positions effectively; and the other is formulating an RL algorithm that can lean into the expansive strategic depth of the game without being explicit guidance from heuristic searches.</p><button class="sr-only button" style="display: none;">Report issue for preceding element</button>

For instance, KataGo simulates 800 times, necessitating at least 800 forward inferences by the neural network. It is well-known that computations involving neural networks are highly resource-intensive. As a result, the application of MCTS-based search algorithms in many real-world scenarios is not practical. Our primary contribution is an attempt to eliminate the use of MCTS, a resource-intensive algorithm, from the production process of board game AI. By optimizing other modules within the algorithmic process, we aim to develop a board game AI that can compete at the level of top human players without relying on MCTS.</p><button class="sr-only button" style="display: none;">Report issue for preceding element</button>

<p class="ltx_p" id="Sx2.SSx1.SSSx1.p1.1">During the initial phase, we utilize a large dataset of human expert games to instill the AI with a base level of competency in Chinese Chess. Based on meticulously designed sampling curves, we sample from the collected game data to obtain game states that serve as inputs for the neural network. For each game state, there is an associated move selection, which may either be a move chosen by top human players based on the current situation, or a move derived from our calculations using the alpha-beta pruning algorithm. To handle the expansive action space (90x90) more efficiently, we factorize it into two steps. The first is the selection of one of the pieces on the board (up to 16 choices, but fewer if some pieces are captured), and the second is choosing a valid move for that piece (up to 90 choices, but typically fewer based on the game’s rules and the current board state).</p><button class="sr-only button" style="display: none;">Report issue for preceding element</button>

In the game of Chinese Chess, the distribution of samples is highly unbalanced. Specifically, the entire gameplay process can be divided into the following three stages: the opening, the middle game, and the endgame. The opening refers to the stage from the start of the game to when both sides have essentially formed their initial battle formations. The main objective during this phase is to arrange the pieces logically and develop them rapidly, particularly key offensive and defensive pieces such as chariots, horses, and cannons. During this stage, it is crucial to coordinate and protect the pieces, avoid early mistakes that could lead to the capture of important pieces, establish a solid defense, and look for vulnerabilities in the opponent’s defense. The middle game is defined as the stage where both parties have essentially completed their opening setups and begin various tactical maneuvers involving attacks, defenses, and exchanges of pieces. This stage is usually characterized by intense combat and frequent changes in the situation. The endgame refers to the stage where there are fewer pieces on the board, and both sides are contending for the final victory. This phase typically requires high computational power and precise judgment. Therefore, as the game progresses, the demand for computational accuracy increases. Consequently, we have designed the following sampling function:</p><button class="sr-only button" style="display: none;">Report issue for preceding element</button>

The auxiliary task aims to forecast the win rate after a given move. By predicting the move’s outcome, the AI can consider not only immediate tactics but also long-term strategy implications. This is particularly useful given that different pieces have unique movement capabilities and exert varying levels of influence over the game. Hence, the AI learns not only to evaluate specific moves, but also to understand the underlying principles that dictate piece value and positional strength. Besides, a well-learned win rate predictor can be used as the initial value function for the reinforcement learning.</p><button class="sr-only button" style="display: none;">Report issue for preceding element</button>

Chinese Chess, also known as Xiangqi, is a complex board game that often necessitates extensive computational simulations to ensure that each move made is optimal. This requirement aligns closely with the functionalities of the Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm. In our research, we have embedded the rules of Chinese Chess into the feature space to enhance the AI’s comprehension of the game.</p><button class="sr-only button" style="display: none;">Report issue for preceding element</button>

1. Based on the current position, identifying which pieces can be moved and to which locations they can be moved.
2. Based on the current position from the opponent’s perspective, identifying potential moves and their destinations.</p><button class="sr-only button" style="display: none;">Report issue for preceding element</button>

However, PPO’s standard application is modified to suit the deterministic and high-stakes nature of Chinese Chess.
To address the challenges of PPO in the Chinese Chess context, we implement the following adjustments:</p><button class="sr-only button" style="display: none;">Report issue for preceding element</button>

Top-tier AI systems need to adeptly handle these various styles. To prevent the AI from settling into a suboptimal state during self-play, we have designed a concept called "Opening Strategy Diversification." This approach ensures that the AI explores a wide range of strategic possibilities, thereby enhancing its adaptability and robustness in real-game scenarios. Instead of sampling from the policy distribution, we manually curate a set of opening moves from top human players. This diversification in the opening book ensures that our AI is exposed to a variety of game commencements, encouraging a broader strategic understanding from the outset of the game.</p><button class="sr-only button" style="display: none;">Report issue for preceding element</button>

Consequently, we have drawn inspiration from the concept of a "League," as utilized in AlphaStar, and have designed a diverse pool of opponent models that serve as opponents during self-play sessions. This pool is continuously updated based on performance metrics and stylistic evaluations, ensuring that our primary AI model is regularly challenged by a wide spectrum of strategic types. The dynamic nature of this pool promotes the emersion of a robust and versatile policy, capable of counteracting diverse strategies.</p><button class="sr-only button" style="display: none;">Report issue for preceding element</button>

<p class="ltx_p" id="Sx2.SSx1.SSSx2.p6.1">Upon analysis, we identified challenges unique to the use of the PPO algorithm in chess-like adversarial games, particularly concerning the estimation of the value function. Firstly, PPO is an on-policy algorithm that also utilizes entropy loss to balance exploration and exploitation. Consequently, it inevitably samples moves that are exceptionally good or poor during gameplay. This variability can cause the win rate to fluctuate dramatically from 0% to 100%, or vice versa, leading to significant volatility in the value function and increasing the neural network’s fitting difficulty. Moreover, this phenomenon becomes more pronounced as the game progresses and the number of sampling steps increases. From this observation, it becomes necessary to implement truncation in the trajectory processing, which is called <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold" id="Sx2.SSx1.SSSx2.p6.1.1">Value Estimation with Cutoff</span>(VECT).</p><button class="sr-only button" style="display: none;">Report issue for preceding element</button>

With these innovative algorithmic enhancements, we aim to elevate the proficiency of our AI to compete at a level indistinguishable from top human players, all in the absence of traditional, computationally demanding search algorithms like MCTS.</p><button class="sr-only button" style="display: none;">Report issue for preceding element</button>

<p class="ltx_p" id="Sx2.SSx2.p1.1">In the course of our research, we have amassed a substantial dataset from the LightSpeed and Quantum Studio’s "TianTian Xiangqi" platform. It is pertinent to note that during the data collection phase, careful measures were taken to filter out private data such as players’ personal information and game details. Only the chess game records were retained, stored in the Portable Game Notation (PGN) format, which adheres to international standards.</p><button class="sr-only button" style="display: none;">Report issue for preceding element</button>

<p class="ltx_p" id="Sx2.SSx2.p2.1">The data collection was conducted in two distinct methods. The first method involved gathering data from the top 10 percent of players, encapsulating approximately five million records. For each game scenario, the moves selected by these elite players were specifically documented. The second method expanded the scope to include a broader spectrum of human expertise, ranging from beginners to top-level players, covering ten million game scenarios. In this approach, an agent created using the Alpha-Beta pruning algorithm annotated the moves to enhance the generalizability of the model training.</p><button class="sr-only button" style="display: none;">Report issue for preceding element</button>

1. Elimination of game records where the number of rounds was less than ten.
2. Removal of games terminated due to players disconnecting, which were primarily attributed to network issues.</p><button class="sr-only button" style="display: none;">Report issue for preceding element</button>

The observation mentioned above can be viewed as an image and seamlessly fed to ResNet. Considering the scenario of chess, we derive a variant of the original ResNet (denoted by <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold" id="Sx2.SSx3.p5.1.1">mod-ResNet</span> in the following paper) by modifying the entrance process block. Concretely, conv1 is changed from conv(7x7, 64, 2) to conv(1x1, 64, 1) and the max pool is removed. The insight behind the modification is the importance and necessity of every single "pixel" in the context of chess in comparison with classic image classification task. Experiment results show that the modification brings considerable improvement in intensity.</p><button class="sr-only button" style="display: none;">Report issue for preceding element</button>

For the similar motivation in mod-ResNet, we treat each "pixel" of the observation as a token instead of patching neighbouring "pixel" as default. Huge improvement in intensity is achieved in the transition from mod-ResNet to ViT.

<p class="ltx_p" id="Sx3.SSx1.p1.1">In this section, we will provide a comprehensive overview of the results obtained from our algorithm. In the main results section, we intend to present the outcomes of our model when pitted against a baseline model, as well as the performance achieved in ranked matches against human opponents. Initially, the evaluation process employed a baseline AI that utilizes the AlphaBeta pruning algorithm. This rule-based AI has demonstrated a level of proficiency approximately within the top 10% percentile in human ranked competitions. We present five representative milestone results that include their performance against baseline, rankings in human ladder tournaments, and data on predictive accuracy at various stages of the training process, as shown in Table.(<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2410.04865v1#Sx3.T1" title="Table 1 ‣ MainResult ‣ Results ‣ Mastering Chinese Chess AI(Xiangqi) Without Search"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>). Initially, the nomenclature of the five models adheres to a format combining the training algorithm with the model structure. Here, ’SL’ denotes Supervised Learning, and ’RL’ indicates Reinforcement Learning. The term <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold" id="Sx3.SSx1.p1.1.1">modResNet</span> refers to our modified version of the ResNet model, adapted specifically for the Chinese Chess scenario, while ’ViT’ (Vision Transformer) repurposes the transformer structure commonly utilized in classical visual contexts.</p><button class="sr-only button" style="display: none;">Report issue for preceding element</button>

When battling against the baseline model, we set the temperature at 1 to ensure diversity in evaluation matchups. Our findings indicate that both the training methodology and model architecture optimizations significantly enhance performance. For instance, using reinforcement learning to further optimize the <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold" id="Sx3.SSx1.p2.1.1">modResNet18</span> architecture increased its win rate against the baseline from 38.6% to 52.3%. Similarly, for the ViT structure, reinforcement learning elevated the win rate from 65.1% under supervised learning to 92.5%. It is important to note that, due to the evaluation sampling at a temperature of 1, the true win rate of RL-ViT against the baseline is likely much higher than 92.5%, approaching 100%.</p><button class="sr-only button" style="display: none;">Report issue for preceding element</button>

The importance of feature modeling may be mitigated if search technologies are employed, as the agent can simulate downwards continuously, ultimately achieving a comprehensive understanding of the current situation. However, in the absence of search and simulation, it necessitates a deeper knowledge of the entire chessboard and the rules of the game on the part of the agent.

Clearly, this approach is not suitable for handling board game information where every piece of information about each chess piece is crucial and does not require merging. Consequently, we modified the traditional ResNet by removing the max pooling and reducing the kernel size to 1x1. The overall experimental results are shown in the Table.(<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2410.04865v1#Sx3.T2" title="Table 2 ‣ Model Architecture ‣ Ablation Study ‣ Results ‣ Mastering Chinese Chess AI(Xiangqi) Without Search"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>).

It is well-known that architectures based on Transformers, which rely on underlying attention mechanisms, can adeptly describe the varying degrees of urgency across different regions of the battlefield. In this regard, we employed the Vision Transformer (ViT) network architecture to handle this image-like board information.

For adversarial games in general, iterative self-improvement can be achieved through self-play in the reinforcement training process. However, this approach has inherent drawbacks: 1. The opponent model lacks diversity; 2. During the training process, the agent gradually forgets previously learned strategies and methods for countering specific strategies. To mitigate these issues, we employ the DOP method. As evidenced in Table X, the incorporation of DOP has enhanced our overall training outcomes, elevating the win rate against the baseline model from 84% to 92.5%.</p><button class="sr-only button" style="display: none;">Report issue for preceding element</button>

However, as indicated in the Table.(<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2410.04865v1#Sx3.T4" title="Table 4 ‣ DOP and VECT ‣ Ablation Study ‣ Results ‣ Mastering Chinese Chess AI(Xiangqi) Without Search"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a>), this configuration does not facilitate effective training in reinforcement learning; the training process tends to crash, with the win rate against the baseline model drastically dropping from 65% to approximately 10%.

<p class="ltx_p" id="Sx4.p1.1">The development and validation of our Chinese Chess AI without search have led to several compelling findings with implications for both reinforcement learning (RL) methods and real-world applications. Here, we discuss the key insights from this research and their potential broader impact.</p><button class="sr-only button" style="display: none;">Report issue for preceding element</button>

<div class="ltx_para" id="Sx4.p3">
<p class="ltx_p" id="Sx4.p3.1">Our results contribute to the growing literature that illuminates the versatility and effectiveness of Transformer architectures. Notably, the performance improvement observed when transitioning from a CNN-based model to a Transformer-based model underscores the superior spatial relation understanding that Transformers offer. This outcome reinforces the idea that attention mechanisms are well-suited to tasks requiring the contextual processing of input features, suggesting that Transformers could have wider applicability in the domain of games with complex strategic elements and perhaps beyond—into areas such as robotics and autonomous systems.

<p class="ltx_p" id="Sx4.p4.1">The enhancement of the AI’s feature set with rules-based information significantly accelerated and improved the learning process. This underscores the importance of deep domain knowledge when designing input representations for learning models. While this work focused on Chinese Chess, there is potential to extend such feature engineering methods to other domains where expert knowledge can guide the representation of state spaces to aid learning algorithms.</p><button class="sr-only button" style="display: none;">Report issue for preceding element</button>

<div class="ltx_para" id="Sx4.p5">
<p class="ltx_p" id="Sx4.p5.1">Our method of diversifying opponent strategies in the training phase highlights the limitations of traditional self-play methods and points to the need for more sophisticated training regimens. The concept of using a dynamic pool of opponents may serve as a blueprint for developing RL agents in other adversarial settings, where the strategic depth of the task benefits from exposure to a variety of strategies.</p><button class="sr-only button" style="display: none;">Report issue for preceding element</button>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="Sx4.p6">
<p class="ltx_p" id="Sx4.p6.1">The introduction of the VECT method in the RL phase provides a robust and stable method for evaluating value functions in turn-based game scenarios, particularly in situations where the overall rewards vary significantly. This is extremely beneficial for learning and developing chess AI, as it helps the AI system to more accurately predict the long-term benefits of its actions, thereby enabling it to make better decisions.</p><button class="sr-only button" style="display: none;">Report issue for preceding element</button>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="Sx4.p7">
<p class="ltx_p" id="Sx4.p7.1">Our findings have notable implications for the future of game AI development. By demonstrating the potential to reach high levels of performance without reliance on search algorithms, we pave the way for more lightweight and adaptable AIs in resource-constrained environments. This approach may be especially relevant for developing AIs for real-world applications where computational resources are limited or where low-latency decisions are crucial. The confluence of high performance and reduced computational demands makes for a compelling case for rethinking traditional approaches to game AI development and, by extension, decision-making systems in broader contexts.</p><button class="sr-only button" style="display: none;">Report issue for preceding element</button>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="Sx4.p8">
<p class="ltx_p" id="Sx4.p8.1">Though our results are promising, several limitations need to be addressed in future work. Most notably, our methods were applied in the context of a deterministic and perfect information game—Chinese Chess. As such, the applicability of our techniques to games or scenarios with elements of randomness or imperfect information remains to be demonstrated. Additionally, the AI’s performance, while impressive, may still benefit from further refinements in architectural design, training algorithms, and feature engineering.</p><button class="sr-only button" style="display: none;">Report issue for preceding element</button>

<div class="ltx_para" id="Sx4.p9">
<p class="ltx_p" id="Sx4.p9.1">In conclusion, this research contributes valuable insights into the reinforcement learning landscape and champions methods that could have implications for decision-making systems in general. As we look to future applications and extensions of our work, the blend of RL strategies, model architectures, and feature representations established herein will undoubtedly inform and inspire ongoing developments in AI.</p><button class="sr-only button" style="display: none;">Report issue for preceding element</button>
