<p id="id10.id1" class="ltx_p">Estimating the actual head orientation from 2D images, with regard to its three degrees of freedom, is a well known problem that is highly significant for a large number of applications involving head pose knowledge. Consequently, this topic has been tackled by a plethora of methods and algorithms the most part of which exploits neural networks. Machine learning methods, indeed, achieve accurate head rotation values yet require an adequate training stage and, to that aim, a relevant number of positive and negative examples. In this paper we take a different approach to this topic by using fractal coding theory and particularly Partitioned Iterated Function Systems to extract the fractal code from the input head image and to compare this representation to the fractal code of a reference model through Hamming distance. According to experiments conducted on both the BIWI and the AFLW2000 databases, the proposed PIFS based head pose estimation method provides accurate yaw/pitch/roll angular values, with a performance approaching that of state of the art of machine-learning based algorithms and exceeding most of non-training based approaches.

<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Whenever an image containing a human face is captured and analyzed, determining head pose often represents a crucial and challenging task for a wide number of applications such as biometric recognition or video surveillance, just to name the most obvious. This particular kind of intra-class variation can significantly affect recognition accuracy as well as have an impact on any application requiring the normalization of head rotation with respect to its three degrees of freedom. The generalization of this problem from single image analysis to video sequence analysis, further extend its relevance and reach, which is typically proportional to absolute head rotation values.
Not surprisingly, then, head pose estimation represents a hot research topic that has been approached by a large number of methods, most of which are based on the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and deep learning (DL) techniques, often providing high accuracy with the not negligible cost of a prior training stage requiring positive and negative examples as input stimula.
Aiming at rivalling the accuracy of CNNs and DL based approaches, yet without the need of previous training process, we present HP2IFS a novel Head Pose estimation method based on Partitioned Iterated Function Systems (PIFS) and fractal image coding. PIFS, typically used for ”lossy” image compression applications, is exploited as a mean to encode auto-similarities within the face image. The resulting fractal parameters vector is therefore compared to an angular reference array previously built through the same fractal coding algorithm by means of Hamming distance metric. Experiments conducted on both the Kinect Head Pose Database (BIWI) and the Automated Facial Landmarks in the Wild dataset (AFLW2000), confirm the validity of the proposed approach and its high accuracy compared to the state-of-the-art. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section II. resumes relevant works related to the present method. Section III. recalls the basics of fractal image coding and PIFS, while Section IV. describes in detail the proposed approach. Finally, Section V. presents the results of the experiments conducted and Section VI. concludes drawing some directions for future research.</p>

<div id="S2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">As already outlined in the introduction, a plethora of head pose estimation methods has been proposed throughout the last decades according to literature surveys such as <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite> and <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>. The majority of contributions to this topic have been based on machine learning approaches through deep neural architectures and more eminently on CNNs which are particularly suited to image processing. First works exploited Gaussian processes <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>, or partial least square (PLS) regression techniques <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite> possibly implemented on support vector machines (SVMs) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>. More recently, Drouard et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite> proposed an approach to regression aimed at robust head pose estimation in the presence of intra-class variations, by mapping feature vectors associated to bounding boxes of faces onto the space of pose-angles and boundig-box translations. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite> face keypoints detection and pose prediction are achieved by learning efficient regressors through an original neural architecture named Heatmap CNN, capable of extracting both global and local features to improve prediction reliability. Aiming at simultaneous face detection, keypoints localization, pose estimation and gender recognition, Ranjan et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite> make full use of deep CNN to develop a synergetic approach to these tasks that result in a boost up of each single task performance.
A total 3D solution to face alignment even for large poses (greater than 45° and up to 90°) is proposed by Zhu et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite> fitting 3D Morphable Models to 2D input face image by means of a cascaded CNN.
With regard to assessing the limits of deep NN for face alignment problem on existing 2D and 3D public datasets, the authors <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite> develop a new public 3D facial landmark dataset named LS3D-W unifying all existing datasets and study the performance of both 2D and 3D pose estimation networks in this new context.
In the quest for a method not relying on facial keypoints, Ruiz et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite> propose to train a multi-loss CNN on the 300W-LP sinthetic dataset to achieve yaw/pitch/roll prediction through joint binned pose classification/regression from intensity images.
On a similar line of research, the authors of <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite> introduce a method without landmarks named FSA-Net, which relies on a soft stagewise regression scheme combining feature maps from different layers/stages.
In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>, a method combining L2 regression loss combined with an ordinal regression loss is used to train a CNN for highly accurate face pose estimation by addressing the ambiguity related to Euler angle representation through quaternions.
Wang et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite> exploits DL in a coarse-to-fine strategy based on two sub-networks trained jointly, where the coarse stage classifies the input face into four bins and the fine regression stage delivers pose angles.
Among the few works not based on machine learning methods, in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite> a quad-tree based vector representing facial landmarks locations is compared to a pre-computed set of 2223 angular variations to estimate head pose to determine the closest approximation to the actual head pose.</p>

<div id="S3.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The fundamental principle of fractal coding consists of the representation of an image by a contractive transform of which the fixed point is close to that image. This fixed point is named as <span id="S3.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">fractal</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>. Banach’s fixed point theorem guarantees that, within a complete metric space, the fixed point of such a transform may be recovered by iterated application thereof to an arbitrary initial element of that space <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>.
Fractal coding techniques are based on the collage theorem, which provides a bound on the distance between the image to be encoded and the fixed point of a transform, in terms of the distance between the transform of the image and the image itself. In the early 1980s, Barnsley <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite> applied his knowledge of fractal and mathematics to image compression, explaining that this transform was composed of the union of a number of affine mappings on the entire image - an iterated function system (<span id="S3.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">IFS</span>) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>.
Fractal compression became a practical reality with the introduction by Jacquin of the <span id="S3.p1.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">partitioned</span>-IFS (<span id="S3.p1.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">PIFS</span>), which differs from an IFS in that each of the individual mappings operates on a subset of the image, rather than on the entire image <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>.</p>

<div id="S3.p2" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S3.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The basic principle is that an image can be reconstructed by using the self-similarities in the image itself. When encoding an image, the algorithm partitions the original image into non-overlapping domain regions; after this, a new partition into smaller blocks (range blocks) is applied. For every range block, the best matching domain block is searched among all domain blocks by performing a set of transformations on the blocks. The compression is obtained by storing only the descriptions of these transformations.</p>

Afterwards, the Viola-Jones algorithm <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite> is used to detect the presence and the location of the face in the image, resulting in a square region containing the face.

These fractal parameters contain information about luminance and geometrical position for the range blocks, the domain block corresponding to each range blocks and the geometrical transformation like rotation and resizing to match the domain block with the range block.
The algorithm transforms the parameters resulting from the fractal compression into an encoding-array, creating a model matrix. Finally, a comparison with the model is performed through the Hamming distance metric, which is particularly suited to compare two data strings having the same length and is defined as the number of bit positions in which the two bits are different according to:</p>

<p id="S5.SS1.p1.8" class="ltx_p">The dataset BIWI offers a lot of image per identity. For this reason we decided to create our model using a one-left-out technique. We created ten different set of experimental data using in turn one individual as tester and the others as model. In particular, we have to emphasise, that every subject has a wide range of poses that cover our angular variation in terms of pitch, yaw and roll. The results about the MAE for each subset tested are shown in table <a href="#S5.T1" title="TABLE I ‣ V-A Results on BIWI ‣ V Experimental results ‣ HP2IFS: Head Pose estimation exploiting Partitioned Iterated Function Systems" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">I</span></a>. As can be seen from the table, there are also great variations in errors between an experimental subset and the other. This can be explained by the geometrical difference between the faces of the subjects. As an example, there are few subjects with a long face and the majority of the subjects have a round face. When the former is the tester, the results appear worst than on a subjects with a round face because there are less similar sample of this shape of face in the model. This is confirmed by the use of Fractal Coding (See Section <a href="#S3" title="III Fractal Image Coding Basics ‣ HP2IFS: Head Pose estimation exploiting Partitioned Iterated Function Systems" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">III</span></a>) that emphasize self-similarity between the sectors of an image.
The overall trend of the errors in terms of percentage of image tested can be seen in Figure <a href="#S5.F4" title="Figure 4 ‣ V-A Results on BIWI ‣ V Experimental results ‣ HP2IFS: Head Pose estimation exploiting Partitioned Iterated Function Systems" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a>.

As observed also in the state-of-the-art, results on AFLW2000 are worse than results on BIWI. However, we can observe a behaviour of the error along the three axis similar to that achieved on BIWI.

<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We presented HP<sup id="S6.p1.1.1" class="ltx_sup">2</sup>IFS, a novel method for head pose estimation based on partitioned iterated function systems to extract a fractal image code from input face to be matched against a reference array through Hamming distance. The proposed approach is explicitly is aimed at achieving accurate angular values for yaw, pitch and roll axis without requiring any neural network architecture and the related training overhead. According to the results of experiments carried out on both BIWI and AFLW2000 reference datasets, the reported pose estimation error is comparable to that of state-of-the-art methods based on machine learning and often inferior to that reported by the best performing non-training based methods.We are currently considering new non-linear transformations capable of enhancing the concept of self-similarity, as well as designing an ad-hoc metric for the distance between IFSs.</p>
