<p id="id2.1" class="ltx_p">LiDAR point clouds can effectively depict the motion and posture of objects in three-dimensional space. Many studies accomplish the 3D object detection by voxelizing point clouds. However, in autonomous driving scenarios, the sparsity and hollowness of point clouds create some difficulties for voxel-based methods. The sparsity of point clouds makes it challenging to describe the geometric features of objects. The hollowness of point clouds poses difficulties for the aggregation of 3D features. We propose a two-stage 3D object detection framework, called MS<sup id="id2.1.1" class="ltx_sup"><span id="id2.1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">2</span></sup>3D. (1) We propose a method using voxel feature points from multi-branch to construct the 3D feature layer. Using voxel feature points from different branches, we construct a relatively compact 3D feature layer with rich semantic features. Additionally, we propose a distance-weighted sampling method, reducing the loss of foreground points caused by downsampling and allowing the 3D feature layer to retain more foreground points. (2) In response to the hollowness of point clouds, we predict the offsets between deep-level feature points and the object’s centroid, making them as close as possible to the object’s centroid. This enables the aggregation of these feature points with abundant semantic features. For feature points from shallow-level, we retain them on the object’s surface to describe the geometric features of the object. To validate our approach, we evaluated its effectiveness on both the KITTI and ONCE datasets.</p>

<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The voxel-based method is one of the mature methods for 3D object detection based on LiDAR. Its foundation lies in converting point clouds into structured voxel, followed by utilizing convolutional neural networks to accomplish the detection task. As illustrated in <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ MS23D: A 3D Object Detection Method Using Multi-Scale Semantic Feature Points to Construct 3D Feature Layer" class="ltx_ref">Figure 1</a>, voxel-based methods can be classified into one-stage and two-stage methods. In the one-stage methods <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>, <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>, point clouds are voxelized, and 3D convolutional network is used for feature extraction. Then the extracted 3D features are squeezed into 2D bird’s-eye view features, and 2D convolutional neural network is used for subsequent detection tasks. Although the one-stage methods have a simple structure and fast detection speed, it may result in the loss of vertical features when squeezing 3D features into 2D features. Otherwise, In the two-stage methods <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>, region proposals, which are the bounding boxes generated in the first stage, are used to aggregate the 3D feature points generated by the 3D convolutional neural network. Then these aggregated features are used to accomplish the final detection task. Compared to the one-stage methods, the two-stage methods complete the detection task in 3D space, avoiding the features loss caused by squeezing 3D features into 2D features. This significantly enhances the detection accuracy of two-stage methods.</p>

<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Although voxel-based two-stage methods have made significant progress, there are still some issues that need to be addressed: (1) In autonomous driving scenarios, for objects with fewer reflected points, such as cyclists, pedestrians, and distant objects, LiDAR can only obtain a limited amount of measurement data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>. The point clouds generated by LiDAR are difficult to accurately describe the geometric features of these objects. In particular, voxelization and downsampling in 3D convolutional neural networks may lead to the loss of foreground feature points. For large objects like cars, the loss of a small number of feature points may not significantly affect the description of their geometric features in the 3D feature layer. However, for objects with fewer reflected points, even a small loss of feature points can greatly impact the description of their geometric features. This kind of geometric features aids the second stage in performing more precise bounding box regression. Therefore, the detection accuracy of voxel-based two-stage methods still performs poorly for objects with fewer reflective points. (2) The point clouds generated by LiDAR primarily reside on the surface of objects, so the centroid of a 3D object may be far from any surface point (the hollowness of point clouds) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>, <a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite>. Therefore, if a small radius is used for feature aggregation on the 3D feature layer, it may fail to aggregate all the foreground feature points. On the other hand, if a large radius is used for feature aggregation, it may aggregate the feature points that belong to other objects or the background, especially when the quality of region proposals is poor. However, previous voxel-based methods did not effectively address the issue of the hollowness of point clouds. To address the two aforementioned issues, we propose a novel two-stage voxel-based method called MS<sup id="S1.p3.1.1" class="ltx_sup"><span id="S1.p3.1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">2</span></sup>3D.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">To improve the detection accuracy for objects with fewer reflective points, we construct a relatively compact 3D feature layer. We use a multi-branch voxel feature extraction method to extract voxel features at different scales. Then, these features from different branches are used to construct the 3D feature layer, incorporating features from different levels. Compared to the previous methods, our method results in a denser distribution of feature points in the 3D feature layer, encompassing various semantic feature features at multi-scales. Additionally, to avoid the loss of foreground feature points caused by downsampling, we propose a sampling method based on distance weights. We sample features based on the distance between feature points and the centroid of object, so as to preserve foreground points as much as possible. By combining these two methods, we have provided the 3D feature layer with abundant feature points, enabling it to better describe the geometric features of objects.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">To address the hollowness of point clouds, we predict the offsets between the feature points in the 3D feature layer and the object’s centroid, and then add these offsets to the coordinates of the feature points in three-dimensional space. This operation allows these feature points to be as close as possible to the object’s centroid, enabling the aggregation of more foreground feature points even when using a smaller radius during feature aggregation. However, moving all feature points of an object to its centroid results in the loss of its original geometric features. Considering that feature points from deep-level have a larger receptive field and rich semantic features, we hope to aggregate all these points to participate in subsequent detection tasks. As for the feature points from shallow-level, they have smaller receptive fields and retain more geometric features. We would like to preserve them on the surface of objects to describe the geometric features of the objects. Therefore, we predict the offsets for the feature point clouds from deep-level, making them as close as possible to the object’s centroid. On the other hand, for feature points from shallow-level, we retain them on the object’s surface. Using this method, we can aggregate deep-level feature points rich in semantic features, while fully describing the geometric features of objects with shallow-level feature points. Subsequent experiments also demonstrate that our proposed feature aggregation method preserves the geometric features of objects in the 3D feature layer while improving the efficiency of 3D feature aggregation.</p>

VoxelNet <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite> is the first one-stage voxel-based method. It first voxelizes the point clouds, transforming the point clouds into a series of voxels. Then, it performs feature extraction on the voxels using 3D convolution. Finally, the extracted 3D features are compressed into 2D bird’s-eye view features, and the 3D detection task is completed from a bird’s-eye view. The voxelization method introduced by VoxelNet enables the application of convolutional neural networks in 3D object detection based on LiDAR. However, in autonomous driving scenarios, the voxels obtained from point clouds are mostly zero-padded, resulting in a significant computational burden when performing feature extraction using 3D convolutional neural networks. To address this issue, SECOND <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite> applies sparse convolution for feature extraction, greatly improving the detection efficiency. In response to the misalignment issue between regression confidence and classification confidence, CIA-SSD <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite> proposes the IoU-aware confidence rectification module, while SA-SSD <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite> proposes an auxiliary network that can be turned off at any time to learn the 3D structural features of point clouds. In the end, CIA-SSD and SA-SSD both achieve a balance between regression confidence and classification confidence. The voxelization method proposed in VoxelNet introduces uncertainty in the embedded feature points within the voxels, which affects the final detection results. MVF <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite> introduces a dynamic voxel encoding method to improve the stability of the detection results. In voxel-based methods, the design of voxel size has a significant impact on detection accuracy. Smaller voxels can provide more fine-grained features but impose a heavy computational burden and have limited receptive fields. Larger voxels can have a larger receptive field but cannot obtain precise position features. HVNet <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite> and SMS-Net <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite> adapt multiple scales of voxels as inputs, achieving a balance between fine-grained features and a large receptive field.</p>

In the part-aggregation stage, RoI-aware Point Cloud Pooling is introduced to refine the region proposals by exploring the spatial relationships within the object parts.

This allows Voxel RCNN to achieve good accuracy even under coarse voxel granularity conditions. Additionally, the simple design of Voxel RCNN reduces computational costs. In general, two-stage methods directly perform the detection task in 3D space and can achieve higher regression accuracy. However, sparse 3D feature layer cannot effectively describe the geometric features of objects, and the hollowness of point clouds also pose challenges for feature aggregation.</p>

The Multi-scale Voxelization divides the raw point clouds input into voxels of different scales. These voxels are subsequently input into the 3D encoder, producing sparse voxel features. Subsequently, the sparse voxel features are transformed into the bird’s-eye view representation, and 3D region proposals are generated using the 2D encoder and the Region Proposal Network (RPN). In the 2D encoder, we utilize the MSSFA module proposed in our previous work PV-SSD <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib47" title="" class="ltx_ref">47</a>]</cite>, designed to facilitate the interaction between local and global features.

<div id="S3.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Given the sparsity of the point clouds and the exacerbation of sparsity through voxelization, many voxel-based two-stage methods conduct aggregation within relatively sparse 3D feature layer. To tackle this issue, we propose a method to construct 3D feature layer using multi-branch feature points. We design the Multi-Scale Voxelization module to generate sparse voxel features with different voxel sizes, facilitating the subsequent construction of the 3D feature layer (notably, we do not simultaneously transform the input point clouds into voxels of different scales; instead, we first encode voxel features at smaller scales, and then perform large-scale voxelization using the features obtained from the smaller-scale encoding). Furthermore, in Multi-Scale Voxelization, we propose a method to sample feature points based on distance weights. This approach helps mitigate the loss of foreground feature points during downsampling to some extent. To ensure the computed weight values are associated with the distance from the point clouds to the object’s centroid, we design a loss function that serves as a supervisory signal for generating the distance weights.</p>

These selected features become the input for the next Multi-Scale Voxelization module. In autonomous driving scenarios, the point clouds often contains a significant number of background points. For the task of 3D object detection, prioritizing point cloud features closer to the objects’ centroid is crucial. The Weight Mean operation gives more attention to the point cloud features closer to the object’s centroid.

<p id="S3.SS1.p6.3" class="ltx_p">Furthermore, inspired by VoteNet <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite>, we hope to make the feature points with rich semantic features closer to the object’s centroid. Therefore, in the final layer of the Multi-Scale Voxelization feature encoder, we introduce the Center Vote operation, which predicts the offset of Voxel-wise Feature from the object’s centroid.

<p id="S3.SS4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Currently, LiDAR typically captures only a few measurements for small or distant objects. Consequently, accurately describing the geometric features of these objects, especially in the 3D feature layer, can be challenging. To tackle this issue, we propose Semantic Feature Aggregation to construct a relatively compact 3D feature layer using semantic feature points generated during the feature encoding process at different levels.</p>

This enables a more accurate depiction of object’s geometric features. Even after voxelization, the resulting sparse semantic voxel preserves more details than the raw point clouds. It’s important to note that the implicit small-scale feature point offsets during the voxel coordinate transformation process and the center vote operation in the final layer of feature points within the multiscale voxelization module prevent a significant number of feature points from having identical coordinates.</p>

<p id="S3.SS4.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Additionally, due to the hollowness of the point clouds, effectively aggregating features in the second phase of feature aggregation within the 3D feature layer becomes challenging. Specifically, when the region proposals generated in the first stage lack precision, feature aggregation with a large radius may merge irrelevant background points. On the other hand, utilizing a small radius for feature aggregation might fail to encompass all foreground points. This difficulty in feature aggregation makes it challenging to accurately regress the bounding box from the RPN during box refinement.</p>

The dataset consists of 7,481 training samples and 7,518 testing samples. Typically, the training data is divided into a training set with 3,712 samples and a validation set with 3,769 samples. In this paper, we randomly split the training set into a training subset of 6,000 samples and a validation subset of 1,481 samples. The training subset is used for model training, while the validation subset assists in selecting the best-performing model. The chosen model is then evaluated on the KITTI testing set. Additionally, we use the data split of 3,712 training samples and 3,769 validation samples for ablation experiments. The KITTI dataset categorizes data into three difficulty levels (Easy, Mod., Hard) based on object size, occlusion, and truncation factors.</p>

Furthermore, LiDAR-based methods are subdivided into three types: (1) point-based, (2) voxel-based (considering that both voxel-based and projection-based methods transform the point clouds into a regular grid-like representation, we categorize both types as voxel-based in <a href="#S4.T1" title="Table 1 ‣ 4.2 Implementation Details ‣ 4 Experiments ‣ MS23D: A 3D Object Detection Method Using Multi-Scale Semantic Feature Points to Construct 3D Feature Layer" class="ltx_ref">Table 1</a>), and (3) point &amp; voxel-based.

<div id="S4.SS3.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS3.p4.1" class="ltx_p">This can be attributed to the following factors: (1) Loss of fine-grained features: Voxel-based methods tend to increase the receptive field of feature points through convolutional downsampling, capturing distant semantic features with larger receptive fields but potentially missing fine local features. (2) Foreground Point Retention: In autonomous driving scenarios, the majority of points constitute background, while only a few points are foreground and relevant for detection. Voxel-based downsampling may result in discarding some foreground points. (3)Sparse 3D feature layer: LiDAR-generated point clouds are sparse, especially for distant, small-sized, and low-reflective objects. Constructing a 3D feature layer through voxelization exacerbates the sparsity of initially sparse feature points, making it challenging to retain geometric features. (4) Object Centroid and Feature Aggregation: LiDAR point clouds often capture only the surfaces of objects, with the centroid of an object frequently distant from feature points.</p>

Analysis attributes this improvement to LiDAR capturing fewer measurements for targets with fewer reflective points, such as pedestrians. Effective feature aggregation is challenging if the region proposals generated in the first stage lack precision, possibly resulting in the aggregation of irrelevant foreground and background points, or failing to aggregate all the necessary foreground points. Our method proposed can avoid the impact of poor-quality region proposals on feature aggregation, achieving better performance in subsequent detection tasks.</p>

<div id="S5.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The voxel-based two-stage 3D object detection method completes the final detection task based on the results of the first stage and has achieved satisfactory performance. However, in autonomous driving scenarios, the sparsity and hollowness of point clouds still pose challenges for voxel-based two-stage methods. As for the sparsity and hollowness of point clouds, this paper proposes a two-stage 3D object detection framework called MS<sup id="S5.p1.1.1" class="ltx_sup"><span id="S5.p1.1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">2</span></sup>3D.</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In response to the sparsity of the point clouds, we propose a new method, which use voxel feature points from multiple branches to constructing the 3D feature layer and samples feature points based on distance weight. By employing voxel feature points from different branches, we successfully build a relatively compact 3D feature layer with rich semantic features. The distance-weighted sampling method helps to preserve foreground feature points as much as possible. To validate the effectiveness of our method, we visualize the 3D feature layer, proving that our method adequately describes the geometric features of objects. In the experiments on the KITTI dataset, our method has shown good performance in detecting cyclists and pedestrians with fewer reflective points (the 3D detection accuracy for cyclists under Mod. conditions is 64.81%, and for pedestrians, it is 42.73%). In addition, to validate the performance of our method in sparse scenes, we randomly dropped 40% of the point clouds on the KITTI dataset to simulate sparse scenarios. The final results also demonstrate that our method performs well in sparse point cloud scenes (3D detection mAP under Mod. conditions is 64.01%).</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p3.1" class="ltx_p">In response to the hollowness of point clouds, we propose a new method, which predict the offsets between deep-level feature points and the object’s centroid, making them as close as possible to the object’s centroid. While for shallow-level feature points , we retain them on the object’s surface. We visualize the 3D feature layer and demonstrate that moving the deep-level feature points to the object’s centroid can aggregate rich semantic features while preserving the geometric features of the object. The results of ablation experiments and visualizations of detection results in the ablation experiment validate the feasibility of our method. The 3D detection mAP under Mod. conditions is as follows: only offsetting the deep-level feature points towards the object’s centroid: 70.14%; only offsetting the shallow-level feature points towards the object’s centroid: 66.86%; only offsetting all feature points towards the object’s centroid: 66.42%; no offset: 68.33%).</p>

<div id="S5.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p4.1" class="ltx_p">In autonomous driving scenarios, there is a need to tackle more complex scenarios, particularly in detecting distant and small objects. The inherent imaging nature of LiDAR result in fewer reflection points for objects at distant and small objects. Although our method performs well for objects with fewer reflection points, the imaging natures of LiDAR make it challenging to describe the geometric features of them using LiDAR point clouds. This poses a difficulty in further improving our method. In the future, we plan to address this issue by utilizing cameras to generate pseudo point clouds. This method aims to compensate for the insufficient description of geometric features in LiDAR point clouds for objects with fewer reflection points.</p>
