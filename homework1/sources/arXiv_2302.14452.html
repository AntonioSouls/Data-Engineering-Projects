<p id="id3.id1" class="ltx_p">Few-shot object detection (FSOD) aims to expand an object detector for novel categories given only a few instances for training. However, detecting novel categories with only a few samples usually leads to the problem of misclassification. In FSOD, we notice the false positive (FP) of novel categories is prominent, in which the base categories are often recognized as novel ones. To address this issue, a novel data augmentation pipeline that Crops the Novel instances and Pastes them on the selected Base images, called CNPB, is proposed. There are two key questions to be answered: (1) How to select useful base images? and (2) How to combine novel and base data? We design a multi-step selection strategy to find useful base data. Specifically, we first discover the base images which contain the FP of novel categories and select a certain amount of samples from them for the base and novel categories balance. Then the bad cases, such as the base images that have unlabeled ground truth or easily confused base instances, are removed by using CLIP. Finally, the same category strategy is adopted, in which a novel instance with category n is pasted on the base image with the FP of n. During combination, a novel instance is cropped and randomly down-sized, and thus pasted at the assigned optimal location from the randomly generated candidates in a selected base image. Our method is simple yet effective and can be easy to plug into existing FSOD methods, demonstrating significant potential for use. Extensive experiments on PASCAL VOC and MS COCO validate the effectiveness of our method.

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In recent years, we have witnessed the great progress of object detection <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>, <a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>, <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>. However, the impressive performance of these models relies on a large amount of annotated data. The detectors cannot generalize well to novel categories, especially when the annotated data are scarce. In contrast, humans can learn to recognize or detect a novel object with only a few labeled examples. Few-shot object detection (FSOD), which simulates this way, has attracted increasing attention. In FSOD, an object detector that is trained using base categories with sufﬁcient data (base images) can learn to detect novel categories using only a few annotated data (novel images).</p>

We test TFA, FSCE and DeFRCN, which are three representative FSOD methods. The reported FP ratio is the average of multiple few-shot settings, including 1-shot, 3-shot, 5-shot and 10-shot. The threshold is used to count FP images whose confidence score on a novel category is higher than the threshold. Using our CNPB, the FP ratio of all methods decreases up to 20<math id="S1.F1.3.3.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\%" display="inline"><semantics id="S1.F1.3.3.1.m1.1b"><mo id="S1.F1.3.3.1.m1.1.1" xref="S1.F1.3.3.1.m1.1.1.cmml">%</mo><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S1.F1.3.3.1.m1.1c"><csymbol cd="latexml" id="S1.F1.3.3.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S1.F1.3.3.1.m1.1.1">percent</csymbol></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S1.F1.3.3.1.m1.1d">\%</annotation></semantics></math>.</span></figcaption>

<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The accuracy of a FSOD model is decided by the true positive (TP) and false positive (FP) of novel categories, since the novel categories are the main concern. The main problem of FSOD is misclassification <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite>, in which novel categories are often recognized as base categories (the FP of base categories). However, the FP of novel categories is previously ignored, which is more important in FSOD. The FP of novel categories means the base categories and background regions that are recognized as the novel categories.</p>

<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.2" class="ltx_p">We analyze the FP ratio of novel categories by using three representative FSOD methods, TFA <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite>, FSCE <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite>, and DeFRCN <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite>, as shown in Figure <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ An Effective Crop-Paste Pipeline for Few-shot Object Detection" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>. We test the trained few-shot model on the base dataset and calculate the FP ratio of novel categories. The FP ratio of FSCE is up to 20<math id="S1.p3.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\%" display="inline"><semantics id="S1.p3.1.m1.1a"><mo id="S1.p3.1.m1.1.1" xref="S1.p3.1.m1.1.1.cmml">%</mo><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S1.p3.1.m1.1b"><csymbol cd="latexml" id="S1.p3.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S1.p3.1.m1.1.1">percent</csymbol></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S1.p3.1.m1.1c">\%</annotation></semantics></math>, and the FP ratio of DeFRCN is up to 60<math id="S1.p3.2.m2.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\%" display="inline"><semantics id="S1.p3.2.m2.1a"><mo id="S1.p3.2.m2.1.1" xref="S1.p3.2.m2.1.1.cmml">%</mo><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S1.p3.2.m2.1b"><csymbol cd="latexml" id="S1.p3.2.m2.1.1.cmml" xref="S1.p3.2.m2.1.1">percent</csymbol></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S1.p3.2.m2.1c">\%</annotation></semantics></math>, which are prominent and can not be overlooked. We think that current few-shot models have high FP ratio because of the small size of training dataset. A weak knowledge is formed in the learned model, which can only recognize the key features of an object. However, the key features of two categories may be the same, such as the sofa and chair both have the backrest. This will lead to high FP ratio. To reduce the FP, we wish to introduce the direct comparison between the TP and FP into the training phase. To this end, one can simply introduce the base images that contain the FP into the novel dataset. However, directly introducing many base images causes the badly data-imbalance issue, and makes the base categories dominate the training process.</p>

<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">In this work, we adopt cutmix <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>]</cite>, an image-mixing data augmentation approach. The naive use of cutmix ignores the FP of novel categories and causes the over-fitting problem in favor of the base categories, as
it generates more base samples than novel ones due to the fewer novel categories <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>]</cite>. Our key idea is to combine the novel images and the base images that contain the FP of novel categories. Specifically, we can Crop the FP region in the Base image and Paste it on a Novel image (CBPN), or we can Crop the Novel instance and Paste it on a Base image which contains FP (CNPB). CBPN uses a few novel images as the background which has the over-fitting problem, since the novel instances are repeated with the same image contexts. CNPB is superior because it can over-sample novel categories and leverage different FP images as the background. As illustrated in Figure <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ An Effective Crop-Paste Pipeline for Few-shot Object Detection" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>, CNPB can decrease the FP ratio of all methods up to 20<math id="S1.p4.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\%" display="inline"><semantics id="S1.p4.1.m1.1a"><mo id="S1.p4.1.m1.1.1" xref="S1.p4.1.m1.1.1.cmml">%</mo><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S1.p4.1.m1.1b"><csymbol cd="latexml" id="S1.p4.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S1.p4.1.m1.1.1">percent</csymbol></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S1.p4.1.m1.1c">\%</annotation></semantics></math>. In CNPB, we investigate two key questions: (1) How to select useful base images? and (2) How to combine novel and base data?</p>

<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S1.p5.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">A multi-step selection strategy for base images</span> is proposed for our CNPB. First, we select the base images containing the FP of novel categories. Second, a small part of FP images are randomly selected to prevent the data-imbalance between the base and novel categories. Third, the base images containing the unlabeled ground truth or the FP that is easily confused with the novel instances (hard cases) are removed by CLIP <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite>. CLIP is a zero-shot recognition model which can use natural language to retrieve related images based on the CLIP score. We remove the hard cases of novel instances because we find using these cases reduces the accuracy of novel categories due to the weak knowledge of the few-shot model. For example, some special chairs are very similar to the sofa. If we use these chairs as negative samples, this will destroy the learned weak knowledge of the model, such as the backrest or the feet of sofa. At last, in order to balance TP and FP in each training iteration, the same category (SC) strategy is proposed. For example, the novel instance ”cow” is pasted on the selected base image containing the FP of ”cow”. <span id="S1.p5.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">When combining the novel instances and the selected base images</span>, the novel instances are over-sampled by cropping and random down-sampling. We wish to avoid the base instances from being occluded. By randomly generating many candidate locations in a selected image, we can paste a processed novel instance at the assigned optimal location, which is determined by the minimum Intersection Over Union (IOU) between the candidates and the bounding boxes of original base instances and the FP regions in the selected base image.</p>

<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">Our key contributions can be summarized as: (1) We propose CNPB, a novel data augmentation pipeline that Crops the Novel instances and Pastes them on the selected Base images, for FSOD. (2) Our method is simple yet effective, and can be easily integrated into existing FSOD methods without any architectural changes or complex algorithms. (3) Our CNPB significantly improves multiple baselines and achieves state-of-the-art performance on PASCAL VOC and MS COCO. </p>

<p id="S2.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In computer vision, data augmentation strategies have been widely adopted, such as mixup <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>]</cite>, cutout <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>, cutmix <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>]</cite> and mosaic <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>, etc. Among them, cutmix and mosaic can be used to do combination for novel and base categories in FSOD.
In cutmix <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>]</cite>, the patches are cut and pasted among training images where the ground truth labels are also mixed proportionally, which is used for image classification. Mosaic <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite> mixes four training images into one image for small object detection.
The most similar method to our CNPB pipeline is cutmix. However, there are several important differences. First, we use the idea of cutmix to solve a new problem of FSOD. Second, the specific objects of cropping and pasting should be designed, in which we crop the novel instance and paste it on the selected base image. Furthermore, our selection strategies for base images are critical.
Without our designed strategies, existing copy-paste methods don’t work in FSOD, such as mosaic in yolov4 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>.
There are also some recent efforts that employ cutmix to tackle the long-tail classification <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite> and instance segmentation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>. Unlike them, we consider the problem of FP by pasting a novel instance on the base image containing the FP and leverage a multi-step selection strategy for the base images in FSOD.</p>

<p id="S3.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S3.SS2.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Step1: Data Preparation.</span> For <span id="S3.SS2.p2.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">base data</span>, first, the fine-tuned few-shot model is used to test the base dataset, then the inference results are obtained. We select the base images as the background by using a multi-step selection strategy. In detail, the base images whose results have the FP of novel instances with higher confidence scores than the threshold are chosen. For each base category, we randomly select a certain amount (3 in our CNPB) of base samples from above FP images for all few-shot settings, indicating great transferable ability. After that, the base images that contain the unlabeled ground truth or the FP that is easily confused with the novel instances (hard cases) are removed by CLIP <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite>.
CLIP is a zero-shot recognition model which can utilize natural language to retrieve related images based on the CLIP score. CLIP gets the input of a textual description of a novel category and an image, and then computes the distance between them. The template of the input text is ”a” with the name of a novel category. The input image is the cropped instance which is predicted to have the novel category by the few-shot model in the base dataset. After inputting the text and current instance into the CLIP model, we can obtain the scores of all novel categories for the current image. If the maximum score is more than 0.5, this image is identified as a bad case which should be removed.
Some samples removed by CLIP are shown in Figure <a href="#S4.F3" title="Figure 3 ‣ 4.4.3 The Methods of Combination ‣ 4.4 Ablation Study ‣ 4 Experiments ‣ An Effective Crop-Paste Pipeline for Few-shot Object Detection" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a> (a)/(b) in section <a href="#S4.SS4.SSS5" title="4.4.5 Visualization ‣ 4.4 Ablation Study ‣ 4 Experiments ‣ An Effective Crop-Paste Pipeline for Few-shot Object Detection" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4.4.5</span></a>.
Finally, to balance TP and FP in each training iteration, we select the base image that has the FP of the current pasted novel instance, which is a strategy of same category (SC). For example, the novel instance ”cow” is pasted on the selected base image containing the FP of ”cow”.

Majority-based combination is duplicating the images, but minority-based combination means deleting the redundant images. For example, if the novel data is 10-shot and the number of the selected base images is 3, majority-based combination duplicates the base images to get 10 base images for pasting each novel instance on each base image. Minority-based combination deletes 7 novel images for pasting the remaining 3 novel instances on the 3 base images. Whether using majority-based combination or minority-based combination, the diversity of novel categories does not change. Because the combined images will be added to the original few-shot set to build a new dataset for fine-tuning. The experimental results show that minority-based combination is better. The reason is that majority-based combination duplicates the base images which are the background of the pasted novel instances. The context with low diversity causes over-fitting problem.</p>

The training strategies of our methods follows the selected baselines. The difference is that we pre-process the few-shot set using our CNPB pipeline.
There are some hyper-parameters in our pipeline. The threshold for selected base images is 0.6 for TFA and DeFRCN, and 0.8 for FSCE. Resize ratio of the novel instances is randomly sampled from 1/5 to 1/2. The number of candidates for pasting the novel instances on a base image is 1000.</p>

<p id="S4.SS4.SSS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">First, compared to CNPB, CNPB without FP causes severe accuracy degradation, however it is still superior to the baseline. CNPB without SC is better than CNPB without FP, and CNPB achieves the best performance. The results demonstrate that the selected FP images is necessary, and applying SC can bring further improvement. Second, using a small number of selected base images, such as 3 or 1, can achieve better performance, because more base images with repeatedly novel samples may cause the over-fitting on the novel categories. Since we use the minority-based method, the results of one base with one novel (1-shot) are equal to more base with one novel. Given 3 selected base images, minority-based is better than majority-based in all settings. However, majority-based is still better than the baseline, which means our CNPB is robust to the combination methods. Third, CNPB without removing can bring slight improvement than the baseline, but using remove operation can obtain much higher performance. CNPB-n uses the minority-based combination with threshold 0.7 to 0.8 for higher performance without removing operation. The threshold of other experiments is 0.8.</p>

CP is using the original setting of cutmix for our tasks, in which the novel and base images are randomly selected. CBPN crops the FP regions in the selected base images and pastes them on the novel images. CNPB crops the novel instances and pastes them on the selected base images.

Addition without selection shows a poor performance, and Addition with selection can not improve the accuracy. Using mosaic can bring modest improvement. CP is better than CBPN, which uses few novel images as the context, causing the over-fitting on these novel images.</p>

Threshold is used to select the base image whose predicted score of a novel category is higher than the threshold. Data augmentation is applying common data augmentation methods on pasted novel instances. The number of novel candidates means the number of randomly generated locations for novel instances. Resize ratio is the downsize ratio of the novel instance. To sum up, setting the threshold as 0.8 to 1 achieves relatively better results. Using data augmentation on novel instances is not useful. The best number of novel candidates is 1000. The random resize ratio is better than a fixed ratio.</p>

(a) Bad cases from PASCAL VOC include some unlabeled ground truth, such as the sofa in the first two images. The rest images of (a) are some hard cases for the few-shot model. For example, the chair/bed is like a small/large version of sofa, and the last boat has the appearance of bus. These targets can hurt the performance of few-shot model, since it just starts to have the ability to recognize these obvious features.
(b) is some bad cases in MS COCO removed by CLIP, such as car, chair, bottle, plotted plant, and dining table. These are all unlabeled novel categories of MS COCO.</p>

<div id="S5.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we propose a novel data augmentation pipeline, called CNPB, that crops the novel instances and pastes them on the selected base images. In detail, we design a multi-step strategy to select the base images. Our method can be easily integrated into existing FSOD methods. Extensive experiments on the few-shot object detection datasets, <em id="S5.p1.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">i.e</em>.<span id="S5.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text"></span>, PASCAL VOC and MS COCO, validate the effectiveness of our method.</p>
