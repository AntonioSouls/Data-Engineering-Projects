<p id="id9.1" class="ltx_p">Pseudo-Labeling has emerged as a simple yet effective technique for semi-supervised object detection (SSOD).
However, the inevitable noise problem in pseudo-labels significantly degrades the performance of SSOD methods.
Recent advances effectively alleviate the classification noise in SSOD, while the localization noise which is a non-negligible part of SSOD is not well-addressed.
In this paper, we analyse the localization noise from the generation and learning phases, and propose two strategies, namely pseudo-label correction and noise-unaware learning.
For pseudo-label correction, we introduce a multi-round refining method and a multi-vote weighting method.
The former iteratively refines the pseudo boxes to improve the stability of predictions, while the latter smoothly self-corrects pseudo boxes by weighing the scores of surrounding jittered boxes.
For noise-unaware learning, we introduce a loss weight function that is negatively correlated with the Intersection over Union (IoU) in the regression task, which pulls the predicted boxes closer to the object and improves localization accuracy.
Our proposed method, Pseudo-label Correction and Learning (PCL), is extensively evaluated on the MS COCO and PASCAL VOC benchmarks.
On MS COCO, PCL outperforms the supervised baseline by 12.16, 12.11, and 9.57 mAP and the recent SOTA (SoftTeacher) by 3.90, 2.54, and 2.43 mAP under 1%, 5%, and 10% labeling ratios, respectively.
On PASCAL VOC, PCL improves the supervised baseline by 5.64 mAP and the recent SOTA (Unbiased Teacherv2) by 1.04 mAP on AP<sup id="id9.1.1" class="ltx_sup"><span id="id9.1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">50</span></sup>.</p>

Localization noise in pseudo-labels comes from two phases: generation and learning.
In the generation phase, some candidate pseudo-labels with inaccurate localization receive high scores (i.e., the box drawn in blue), leading to the positional mismatch between pseudo-labels and ground-truth.
In the learning phase, the inaccurate pseudo-labels cause a serious noisy problem in label assignment.
Specifically, some candidate proposals are incorrectly assigned with wrong training targets (i.e., the dashed boxes drawn in red), which confuses the model in judging which candidate proposal should give a high score.
As these two phases are conducted alternately during training, the localization noise will be accumulated, making training more challenging.</span></figcaption>

<span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_section">1 </span>Introduction</h2>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Benefiting from large-scale dataset and growing computational power, deep neural networks have led to great success in computer vision.
In the standard supervised learning protocol, the volume and quality of labels are extremely crucial to the performance.
However, collecting human annotations is labor-intensive and time-consuming, especially for instance-level annotations such as object detection.
Semi-supervised learning (SSL) is an effective remedy that utilizes a small portion of labeled data and abundant unlabeled data to achieve satisfactory performance.
SSL has achieved significant progress in classification tasks in recent years, with performance comparable to fully supervised learning  <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>, <a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite>.
However, semi-supervised object detection (SSOD), which is more challenging than semi-supervised classification, has not been adequately explored.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Recent state-of-the-art SSOD methods <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>, <a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>, <a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>, <a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite> are based on pseudo-labeling with a mean-teacher structure <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>.
The student model is supervised using the pseudo-labels generated by the teacher model, so the quality of pseudo-labels directly impacts the performance of SSOD.
Nevertheless, the noise problem of pseudo-labels significantly degrades the performance of SSOD.
This noise consists of classification noise (i.e., misclassification) and localization noise (i.e., localization inaccuracy).
The former one is treated as a confirmation bias issue in SSL, many off-the-shelf methods <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>, <a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite> are proposed to significantly reduce the classification errors.
However, the latter one, as a non-negligible component of pseudo-label noise, has not been well addressed.
As shown in Fig. <a href="#S0.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ Pseudo-label Correction and Learning For Semi-Supervised Object Detection" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>, localization noise impacts the training of SSOD from generation and learning phases.
Pseudo-labels with poor localization quality will lead to incorrect label assignment, which easily makes the model confused and severely degrades the detection performance.
Therefore, <span id="S1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">(1) how to guarantee the localization quality of pseudo-labels?</span> and <span id="S1.p2.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">(2) how to learn to localize objects from noisy pseudo-labels?</span> are the concerns of this paper.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">For the first concern, significant efforts <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite> have been made to design appropriate selection strategies to filter out low-quality pseudo-labels, thereby ensuring the localization quality of pseudo-labels.
However, few have considered to directly revise the pseudo-labels in a self-correcting manner.
We found the inaccuracy of the pseudo-labels comes from two aspects, i.e., the prediction instability and the unreliability of NMS (Non-Maximum Suppression).
To address the above two issues, a pseudo-label correction method is proposed to self-correct pseudo-labels with two steps, i.e., multi-round refining and multi-vote weighting.
The primary objective of the multi-round refining step is to improve the stability of pseudo-labels.
To achieve this, we repeatedly feed the pseudo boxes into the teacher’s RCNN layer for refinement.
As for multi-vote weighting step, we argue that the prediction boxes are interrelated, in contrast to NMS which considers them independently.
Specifically, we introduce the box jitter function to the pseudo boxes with a particular variance.
Then, we correct the pseudo boxes by assigning weights to the scores of adjacent jittered boxes.
Pseudo-label correction is a heuristic algorithm that uses the output score as an indicator to search for an optimized box locally within the feature map space.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">For the second concern, the research of it is still in the early stage.
Some existing approaches include Unbiased Teacher <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>, which achieves better performance without learning the pseudo-label localization;
Dense Teacher  <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite>, which utilizes the teacher model’s predictions as soft-labels to guide the localization learning of the student model;
and SCMT<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite>, which introduces a localization loss weight function proportional to the IoU, enhancing the learning of confident pseudo boxes.
Despite these efforts, there is no conclusive answer on how to effectively learn the regression task from pseudo-labels.
In our framework, we compared the aforementioned methods and found that designing soft weights that are negatively correlated with the IoU value leads to the best results.
These results suggest that pseudo boxes with high confidence may not be as accurate as human annotations, they can also guide a relatively accurate optimization direction.</p>

Firstly, weakly augmented images are fed into the teacher model to generate pseudo-labels.
To ensure the accuracy of the pseudo-labels, we apply the pseudo-label correction method to self-correct them.
Then, strongly augmented images are input to the student model to generate proposals, which are further processed by the teacher’s RCNN layer to obtain soft labels and soft weights, as indicated by the dotted lines.
Finally, we employ the noise-unaware learning strategy to compute unsupervised loss.

The majority of SSL methods for image classification can be roughly categorized into two types: consistency regularization and pseudo-labeling.
Consistency regularization methods <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite> rely on the assumption that no matter what perturbations are applied, the model should keep the consistent output for the same unlabeled data.
Data augmentation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>, model perturbation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>, and adversarial training <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite> are the main strategies to introduce perturbations.
Additionally, a mean teacher <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite> structure is proposed, which ensembles time-series models through exponential mean average (EMA) to form a teacher model, and then guides the student model to maintain consistency during training.
Pseudo-labeling methods <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite> employ weak data augmentation to annotate pseudo-labels for unlabeled data.
Due to their general and task-agnostic advantages, they have been widely used in SSL.
However, they tend to underperform due to the noise of pseudo-labels.
<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite> explore the consistency between weak and strong data augmentation through soft pseudo-labels, mitigating the harmful impacts of noise.</p>

Inspired by SSL, pseudo-labeling and consistency regularization are the mainstream methods of SSOD.
In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>, flip consistency and interpolation consistency are used to perform instance-level consistency for SSOD.
STAC <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite> firstly applies pseudo-labels performed on weak and strong data augmentation into SSOD.
Following STAC <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>, <a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite> further develope pseudo-labeling and achieve a significant performance improvement.
However, the noise of pseudo-labels has always been the crux of pseudo-labeling methods.
Generally, the noise in pseudo-labels consists of two parts, including classification noise and localization noise.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p3.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S2.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Classification noise in semi-supervised object detection:</span>
Classification noise has already attracted a lot of attention in the SSOD community.
Humble Teacher <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite> exploits KL divergence to narrow classification output distributions of the teacher and the student model.
LabelMatch <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite> utilizes soft-labels generated by the teacher model to guide the learning of the student model.
SoftTeacher <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite> adds soft-weights to negative pseudo-labels to alleviate missing detection problem.
SCMT <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite> proposes to dynamically re-weight the unsupervised loss of each proposal from both RPN and RCNN parts.
After extensive research, adopting soft labeling or soft weighting techniques in SSOD can greatly alleviate the impact of classification noise.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p4.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S2.p4.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Localization noise in semi-supervised object detection:</span>
While, the research of the localization noise is still in the early stage.
Many existing works guarantee the quality of pseudo-labels by designing pseudo-label selection strategies.
For instance, STAC <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite> and SoftTeacher <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite> simply set a high filter threshold.
LabelMatch <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite> proposes an adaptive thresholding strategy, which considers the distribution of labeled data and sets different thresholds for different categories.
RPL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite> proposes to add an extra certainty-aware task to estimate regression quality of pseudo-labels.
Unbiased Teacherv2 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite> proposes to predict uncertainties on the regression branch to select pseudo-labels for boundary prediction.
However, these methods only focus on selecting pseudo-labels rather than correcting them during generation.
In contrast, we propose to self-correct the pseudo-labels by enhancing their stability and relatedness.
We argue that our proposed pseudo-label correction strategy is orthogonal to the above works and can work collaboratively with them.
Another branch of research is on learning localization knowledge from noisy pseudo-labels, with various strategies proposed, such as hard labels <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>, <a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite>, soft labels <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite>, and soft weights <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>.
In our framework, we compared these three types of techniques, and proposed a novel learning strategy that can tightly pull the prediction boxes around the objects.</p>

The teacher model predicts the pseudo-labels of unlabeled data, and the student model is trained by both labeled data and unlabeled data.

Furthermore, We observed that this process reaches saturation after several rounds of refinement, indicating that the model is confident and requires little correction.
The intuitive assumption behind multi-round refining is that <span id="S3.SS2.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">the smaller the output variance between two rounds, the more confident the model is towards the output, and thus the pseudo-labels are more accurate.</span></p>

Its “winner-takes-all” strategy speeds up the post-processing and effectively suppresses overlapping false-positive bounding boxes.
However, due to inaccurate pseudo boxes, some inaccurately localized boxes are assigned high scores, which makes it unreliable to rely on the score of individual boxes to determine the output box.
Therefore, we propose to exploit the scores of the surrounding boxes together to decide the position of the output box.</p>

Then, The jittered boxes are fed into the RCNN layer again to obtain their prediction boxes and scores.
Finally, we normalize the prediction scores and use them as weights to sum the prediction boxes, getting the final self-corrected boxes.
This method transforms the localization of pseudo boxes from being solely determined by the box with the maximum score to being voted by the surrounding boxes.
As shown in Fig <a href="#S3.F3" title="Figure 3 ‣ 3.1 Preliminary ‣ 3 Methodology ‣ Pseudo-label Correction and Learning For Semi-Supervised Object Detection" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a> (b), after multi-vote weighting, the localization of output boxes can be more accurate.
The intuitive assumption behind it is that <span id="S3.SS2.p5.7.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">inaccurate boxes will be corrected by surrounding boxes that are close to objects, as they are likely to have high weights.</span></p>

<div id="S3.SS3.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">After correcting the pseudo-labels, their quality has been improved, but noise may still be present.
Therefore, we propose a noise-unaware strategy to extract crucial knowledge from the noisy pseudo-labels.
Specifically, we first align the proposals of the student model and the teacher model by an affine transform function, as in  <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite>.
Then, the proposals of the student are fed into the teacher model to obtain soft outputs, including boxes and scores.
After that, we can calculate the unsupervised loss between the prediction of the student model and the output of the teacher model.</p>
</div>
<div id="S3.SS3.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS3.p2.8" class="ltx_p">For the unsupervised localization task, we use the corrected boxes as the labels and design a novel re-weighting function.
In general, the smaller the output difference between the student model and the teacher model (i.e., the larger the IoU), the more credible the sample is, so the loss weights should be increased.
However, we get an opposite conclusion: <span id="S3.SS3.p2.8.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">designing the loss weight that is negatively correlated with IoU values works better.</span>
As shown in Fig. <a href="#S3.F3" title="Figure 3 ‣ 3.1 Preliminary ‣ 3 Methodology ‣ Pseudo-label Correction and Learning For Semi-Supervised Object Detection" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a>(d), we conduct a empirical study to analysis the relations between scores and IoU.
It shows that most of the pseudo-labels with high confidence have high IoU values too.
Therefore, we argue that the pseudo-labels, although not as accurate as ground-truth, can also indicate the right direction to optimize the localization task.
When the gap between the predictions and pseudo-labels is large, they are also likely to be far away from the ground-truth.
Therefore, we design the unsupervised regression loss as follows:</p>

However, our method can easily be adapted to other detectors as well.
The pseudo-label selection threshold is set to 0.7, which is the same as SCMT <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite>.

Under <span id="S4.SS3.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">COCO-standard</span>, as shown in Table <a href="#S3.T1" title="Table 1 ‣ 3.2 Pseudo-label correction ‣ 3 Methodology ‣ Pseudo-label Correction and Learning For Semi-Supervised Object Detection" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>, our method outperforms SoftTeacher by 3.90, 2.54, and 2.43 mAP, and boosts the accuracy of supervised learning by 12.16, 12.11, and 9.57 mAP.
The most similar method compared with ours is SCMT <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite>, which filters pseudo-labels with a low threshold and utilizes a soft-weight technique to the loss calculation.
Our proposed PCL shows consistent accuracy improvements at all settings of the MS COCO, with AP values exceeding 1 point.
When compared with other recent SOTA methods, although our method is not the best at the 1% setting, it outperforms the other methods significantly at 5% and 10% settings.

Adding the pseudo-label correction strategy, i.e., MR (multi-round refining) and MW (multi-vote weighting), further increases mAP from 34.5 to 35.1.
Furthermore, We conduct a visualisation analysis on pseudo-label correction, as shown in Fig. <a href="#S4.F4" title="Figure 4 ‣ 4.4 Ablation study ‣ 4 Experiments ‣ Pseudo-label Correction and Learning For Semi-Supervised Object Detection" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a>.
It clearly shows that the position of some inaccurate boxes (drawn in red) has been corrected (drawn in green).
This phenomenon is also consistent with the results of our statistical analysis in Fig. <a href="#S3.F3" title="Figure 3 ‣ 3.1 Preliminary ‣ 3 Methodology ‣ Pseudo-label Correction and Learning For Semi-Supervised Object Detection" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a>(b)(c), proving the effectiveness of our method.</p>

We research the effect of different label and weight settings in unsupervised regression loss.
As shown in Table <a href="#S3.T5" title="Table 5 ‣ 3.3 Noise-unaware learning ‣ 3 Methodology ‣ Pseudo-label Correction and Learning For Semi-Supervised Object Detection" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5</span></a>, using the hard label and soft weight that is negatively correlated to IoU works the best.
This result suggests that it is important to enhance the learning of prediction boxes that are far from the pseudo boxes.
In addition, using the soft label is not ideal, with an AP gap of 0.9 compared to the hard label.
We guess that not all soft labels generated by the teacher model are accurate, learning them all will make the model confused in training.
Moreover, we conduct a visualisation analyse on the prediction boxes with and without NMS as shown in Fig.  <a href="#S4.F5" title="Figure 5 ‣ 4.4 Ablation study ‣ 4 Experiments ‣ Pseudo-label Correction and Learning For Semi-Supervised Object Detection" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5</span></a>.
It is clear that our PCL has denser prediction boxes than SoftTeacher <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite>.

<div id="S4.SS5.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this section, we validate the transferability of our method to other SSOD methods.
Specifically, we have re-implemented the Unbiased Teacher <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite> within our framework and applied the same data augmentation as in  <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite>.
By incorporating the pseudo-label correction (PLC) discussed in Sec <a href="#S3.SS2" title="3.2 Pseudo-label correction ‣ 3 Methodology ‣ Pseudo-label Correction and Learning For Semi-Supervised Object Detection" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3.2</span></a> and the unsupervised regression loss (URL) defined in Eq. <a href="#S3.E6" title="In 3.3 Noise-unaware learning ‣ 3 Methodology ‣ Pseudo-label Correction and Learning For Semi-Supervised Object Detection" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">6</span></a>, we have observed a notable improvement of 1.1 mAP in accuracy.
As for SoftTeacher <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite>, we adopted a low threshold towards pseudo-label selection, similar to SCMT <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite>, i.e., 0.7.
This modification can significantly alleviate the missing detection problem in SoftTeacher, improving the accuracy from 31.9 mAP to 33.8 mAP.
When we incorporated PLC and URL into SoftTeacher, we observed an additional increase in accuracy of 1.0 mAP.
In addition, when we applied PLC into PseCo <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>, a more recent SSOD method, there is also a 1.1 mAP improvement.
The consistent improvements in performance demonstrate the general applicability of our method.
Importantly, since PCL is orthogonal to most existing SSOD methods, it can be easily incorporated to remarkably improve accuracy.</p>

<div id="S5.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we present a novel approach to address the issue of localization noise in semi-supervised object detection.
Our proposed pseudo-label correction method is a plug-and-play solution that significantly improves the stability and localization accuracy of pseudo-labels, leading to a better overall performance.
Moreover, we investigate the challenging problem of learning the localization knowledge from noisy pseudo-labels, and introduce a novel regression loss weight design that facilitates precise object localization.
Our approach is extensively evaluated on popular benchmarks including MS COCO and PASCAL VOC, and the results demonstrate its remarkable effectiveness.</p>
