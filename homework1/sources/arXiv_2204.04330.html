<p id="id16.id1" class="ltx_p">For certain manipulation tasks, object pose estimation from head-mounted cameras may not be sufficiently accurate. This is at least in part due to our inability to perfectly calibrate the coordinate frames of today’s high degree of freedom robot arms that link the head to the end-effectors. We present a novel framework combining pre-touch sensing and deep learning to more accurately estimate pose in an efficient manner. The use of pre-touch sensing allows our method to localize the object directly with respect to the robot’s end effector, thereby avoiding error caused by miscalibration of the arms. Instead of requiring the robot to scan the entire object with its pre-touch sensor, we use a deep neural network to detect object regions that contain distinctive geometric features. By focusing pre-touch sensing on these regions, the robot can more efficiently gather the information necessary to adjust its original pose estimate. Our region detection network was trained using a new dataset containing objects of widely varying geometries and has been labeled in a scalable fashion that is free from human bias. This dataset is applicable to any task that involves a pre-touch sensor gathering geometric information, and has been made publicly available. We evaluate our framework by having the robot re-estimate the pose of a number of objects of varying geometries. Compared to two simpler region proposal methods, we find that our deep neural network performs significantly better. In addition, we find that after a sequence of scans, objects can typically be localized to within 0.5 cm of their true position. We also observe that the original pose estimate can often be significantly improved after collecting a single quick scan.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In order to achieve object manipulation in unstructured environments, a robot must be able to estimate object pose with respect to its end-effectors at an accuracy that is determined by the task. Head-mounted sensors that are commonly used in robotics may not be able to provide sufficient accuracy because of our inability to perfectly calibrate the robot’s joints and cameras. Even slight mis-calibrations can be compounded by the high degree-of-freedom nature of modern robot arms, resulting in a significant positional and/or rotational error. Alternatively, proximity sensors mounted to the robot’s end-effectors can avoid these calibration errors, and thereby provide the feedback that is necessary for highly precise tasks. We refer to this type of sensing as ’pre-touch’ because it allows the robot to measure the object at close range but before making contact. However, these types of sensors typically only provide spatially sparse measurements, and therefore require more actuation to collect enough data to re-estimate an object’s pose. In order to minimize actuation time, we propose to train a deep neural network to predict object regions that will yield discriminative information about the object’s pose when scanned by a pre-touch sensor.</p>

<figcaption class="ltx_caption"><span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_figure">Figure 2: </span>Left: Suppose the pose in the x and y directions is initially uncertain. Middle: A horizontal pre-touch scan localizes the object in the x direction, but its position in the y direction is still uncertain. Right: Alternatively, a diagonal scan at the corner yields additional geometric features that eliminate uncertainty in both the x and y directions.</figcaption>
</figure>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">While specifying which regions are optimal for pre-touch sensing is not, in general, obvious, deep neural networks have the potential to learn feature hierarchies that encode them. An example of what such a deep network might learn is illustrated in Fig. <a href="#S1.F2" title="Figure 2 ‣ I INTRODUCTION ‣ Improved Object Pose Estimation via Deep Pre-touch Sensing" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>. Suppose that the robot is uncertain about the pose of the object in the x and y directions, but is equipped with a pre-touch sensor that can measure depth along the z axis. Applying the pre-touch sensor across the horizontal region would provide much information about the pose in the x direction, but little information about the pose in the y direction. A more efficient strategy would be to scan diagonally at the corner of the object, allowing the robot to estimate the pose of the object in both the x and y directions well. While this is an example for a simple object, in general we encourage our network to predict regions that are relatively unique with respect to adjacent regions. We expect that such regions will be irregularly shaped, asymmetric and/or contain edges.</p>

<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">The application of machine learning to pre-touch sensing has not been well explored. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first work to use deep neural networks to predict regions that are amenable to pre-touch sensing. We also created a publicly available dataset (<a target="_blank" href="https://bitbucket.org/planc509/pretouch_learn_dataset" title="" class="ltx_ref ltx_href">https://bitbucket.org/planc509/pretouch_learn_dataset</a>) of 136 common items with widely varying geometries.

<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In order to effectively interact with an object in the presence of occlusions and uncertainty, a robot needs to decide how to employ its sensors such that it collects the most informative feedback relative to the current task. Here we examine two proposed components of this process that up to this point have mostly been kept separate. We first review work related to sensors that break the convention of being mounted on the robot’s head in an attempt to sense at a closer range and avoid occlusion. In the second part, we explore ways in which deep learning has been applied to robot manipulation.</p>

Schmitz et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite> train a deep neural network to recognize objects based on tactile feedback. Using the 241 element sensor array that covers their four-fingered robot hand, they demonstrate the vast recognition improvement provided by a deep network compared to a shallow model when evaluated on their twenty item dataset. These works are examples of effective robot tactile sensing, but they all avoid the issue of contact causing incidental displacement of the object and thereby invalidating the robot’s belief or even causing the task to fail.</p>

<p id="S2.SS1.SSS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Pre-touch sensors serve as a compromise between short-range tactile sensors and long-range head mounted sensors. Like tactile sensors, they are attached to the end effector, allowing the robot to deal with occlusion, as well as potentially make more accurate measurements by sensing at a closer range. However, like head mounted sensors, they do not require contact before making a measurement, and thereby overcome the issue of incidental object displacement that tactile sensing can cause. Numerous sensing modalities for pre-touch have been explored, each of which has its own unique benefits and drawbacks.</p>

<div id="S2.SS1.SSS3.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.SSS3.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Optical pre-touch sensors operate by estimating distance through the measurement of infrared beams that are emitted by the sensor and reflected by the object. While the optical modality is applicable to a wide variety of objects, most implementations are not able to provide accurate distance estimations of transparent objects. Hsiao et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite> estimate the pose of the surface local to each of their robot’s fingers using a bayesian belief framework based on optical pre-touch measurements. While <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite> is limited to local surface estimation, our method is capable of both local and global pose estimation. Maldonando et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite> use an optical sensor to measure areas that are occluded from the head-mounted sensor’s view, allowing them to compute better quality grasps. Guo et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite> use a break beam optical sensor to sense objects that are difficult to measure with other optical sensors. Yang et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite> use an optical time-of-flight pre-touch sensor to accurately manipulate a Rubik’s cube, as well as roughly estimate the pose of a number of objects.</p>

<div id="S2.SS1.SSS3.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.SSS3.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Electric field sensing has also been widely explored for pre-touch sensors. These sensors typically operate by generating a displacement current from a transmit electrode to one or more receive electrodes. Objects in proximity to the sensor can alter the signal measured at the receiver(s) by either increasing conductance between the electrodes or by shunting current away. Electric field sensors are most effective when measuring objects that have a dielectric constant significantly different than air, such as metal, while items with low dielectric contrast, such as plastic, are difficult to detect. The use of electric field sensing for robot grasping is explored in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite> and <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>. This modality has also been applied to other robot tasks, such as estimating the fill level of a container <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite> and collision avoidance <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>.</p>

Jiang and Smith <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite> develop the first acoustic pre-touch sensor, which operates by measuring the resonant frequency of a pipe embedded inside of the sensor. The resonant frequency varies as objects near the pipe cause the effective length of the pipe to change. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>, this sensor is combined with haptic-aided teleoperation in order to grasp transparent objects, which are difficult to detect with more common optical-based sensors.

<p id="S3.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Given a point cloud of an object from a head-mounted Kinect and a point cloud resulting from a scan by the (more accurate) pre-touch sensor, correspondences between the two sets of data must be found in order to quantify the difference between the two. It is expected that the discrepancy between their centroids be on the order of a few centimeters, and that the two clouds have similar overall orientations. Aligning two point clouds that have a misalignment of this magnitude is well suited to the ICP algorithm, as opposed to a full registration approach that might be taken when the pair are more drastically misaligned. In aligning the two clouds using ICP, the algorithm yields a spatial transformation between the robot’s old error prone belief (based on the Kinect cloud) and its new belief (based on the pre-touch sensor cloud).</p>

<p id="S3.SS3.p2.1" class="ltx_p">While the above strategy allows the robot to re-estimate the pose of an object, obtaining a full pre-touch scan of the object can be expensive in terms of actuation time. It would be more efficient if the robot could re-estimate pose by only scanning a portion of the object and then matching it with the corresponding portion of the original Kinect cloud. The difficulty is that as less pre-touch data is gathered, the number of discriminative features in the scan decreases, making the matching more susceptible to error caused by noise and differing sensor characteristics. However, by choosing regions to scan that are rich in discriminative geometric features, the robot can collect data efficiently while still achieving high quality pose re-estimation. We describe how we learn to detect such regions in the next section.

A common strategy for detection is to classify sub-patches of the image, and then consider the most certain positive classifications to be detections. The naive approach is to individually classify all sub-patches of the image, but this is very inefficient. Lenz et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite> address this issue by using a small neural network to evaluate a large pool of candidates before passing the most promising ones to a larger network.

While the original Faster R-CNN implementation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite> was designed for object detection, we expanded it to be able to predict rotated rectangles (this required us to efficiently calculate the overlap between two rotated rectangles, which was achieved with the General Polygon Clipper library <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite>) We initialized the convolutional layers of our network with the ’CNN_M’ pre-trained network from <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite>.

Ultimately we want to choose regions that when scanned by a pre-touch sensor, produce data that can be reliably matched with the corresponding regions of the original Kinect cloud in the presence of random noise and calibration error. Although a human may be able to label some of these areas, his or her intuition may not always coincide with what is optimal from an ICP perspective. Furthermore, if we can automate the data collection process, it will be easier to scale up the size of the dataset such that there is sufficient data to avoid overfitting.

<div id="S5.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In order to evaluate the proposed framework, we apply it to pose estimation of eight objects that are not in the dataset used to train the deep neural network. For each object, the PR2 robot receives an initial point cloud from the Kinect, which our detection network uses to propose a set of pre-touch scanning regions. For each region, the robot scans along the path that corresponds to the perimeter of the rectangle. After performing each scan with the pre-touch sensor, we match it with the corresponding region of the Kinect cloud, where the corresponding region is computed in a fashion similar to that of lines 6-8 of Algorithm <a href="#alg1" title="Algorithm 1 ‣ IV-C Data Collection ‣ IV Learning Where to Sense ‣ Improved Object Pose Estimation via Deep Pre-touch Sensing" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>. We obtain a ground-truth estimate of the pose by matching a separate pre-touch scan of the whole object with the Kinect cloud. We argue that this is reasonable because, again, the data from the pre-touch sensor is not affected by mis-calibration of the coordinate frames of the robot’s arms. We have also observed, for example as in Fig. <a href="#S2.F3" title="Figure 3 ‣ II-B Deep Learning for Manipulation ‣ II Related Work ‣ Improved Object Pose Estimation via Deep Pre-touch Sensing" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a>, that data from the pre-touch sensor matches reality better than data from the Kinect. All scans were performed such that the sensing beam was normal to the supporting table for simplicity, but future systems could use more complex scanning strategies.</p>

<div id="S5.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We compare our region proposal network to two other baseline proposal methods. The first baseline simply proposes random rectangles that have the same properties as those used in the label generation process (Section <a href="#S4.SS3" title="IV-C Data Collection ‣ IV Learning Where to Sense ‣ Improved Object Pose Estimation via Deep Pre-touch Sensing" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag"><span class="ltx_text">IV-C</span></span></a>). The second baseline, which is a variant of normal aligned radial features (NARF)<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite>, proposes regions in which there is a large change in the object’s surface. This method first calculates standard NARF keypoints and corresponding descriptors. For each key point, the corresponding rectangle is defined by two perpendicular vectors whose origins are at the keypoint. The direction of the first vector corresponds to the element of the descriptor that has the greatest value, and the direction of the second is chosen according to which of the two elements perpendicular to the first has the greater descriptor value. The length of these vectors is chosen so that the rectangle’s area is half that of the rectangle bounding the object. The rectangle’s confidence score is the sum of the two elements that correspond to the chosen directions.</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.SS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">For each of the three methods, we collected scans corresponding to the first ten proposed rectangles for each of the objects, individually matched them to the corresponding portions of the Kinect cloud as previously described, and computed the average distance across corresponding points of the estimated aligned cloud and the ground truth aligned cloud. These pose estimate errors’ means and standard deviations are shown in Table <a href="#S4.T1" title="TABLE I ‣ IV-C Data Collection ‣ IV Learning Where to Sense ‣ Improved Object Pose Estimation via Deep Pre-touch Sensing" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">I</span></a>. The standard deviations can be interpreted as a measure of each method’s consistency, where a lower value indicates greater consistency. For all but one of the items, our region detection network had the lowest mean, typically by a significant margin. Also, the network had the lowest standard deviation for most of the items, while being outperformed by a small margin on two of the items.</p>

<div id="S5.SS2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">While the previous section demonstrated the performance of individual scans proposed by the region detection network, it is possible that a smaller margin of error is desired. We hypothesize that even better pose estimation can be achieved by concatenating multiple scans together. Specifically, we create a sequence of regions to be scanned by ordering them by their confidence scores. After performing each scan with the pre-touch sensor, we concatenate it with the previous scans before matching it with the corresponding regions of the Kinect cloud.</p>

As seen in Fig. <a href="#S4.F5" title="Figure 5 ‣ IV-C Data Collection ‣ IV Learning Where to Sense ‣ Improved Object Pose Estimation via Deep Pre-touch Sensing" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5</span></a>, the pose estimation for each object typically improves as additional area is scanned. Fig. <a href="#S4.F5" title="Figure 5 ‣ IV-C Data Collection ‣ IV Learning Where to Sense ‣ Improved Object Pose Estimation via Deep Pre-touch Sensing" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5</span></a> also shows that most of the objects could be localized to within approximately 0.5 cm after scanning less than twenty percent of the object. Some objects, such as the gripper, wallet, and cleanser achieved this accuracy after scanning less than ten percent of the object. Finally, for most of the objects, the pose estimation improves from the Kinect-based pose estimate after only a single scan. The sequence of region detections and pose estimations for each object is shown in Fig. <a href="#S5.F6" title="Figure 6 ‣ V Results ‣ Improved Object Pose Estimation via Deep Pre-touch Sensing" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">6</span></a>. Most of the regions proposed by the network seem reasonable. It is especially promising that when examining the cleanser, the first region proposed by the network was the geometrically unique dispersal end of the object. Fig. <a href="#S5.F6" title="Figure 6 ‣ V Results ‣ Improved Object Pose Estimation via Deep Pre-touch Sensing" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">6</span></a> further illustrates how a robot could strategically choose how much time it spends scanning. If the robot can only afford a small amount of actuation time, a single scan could be used to most likely improve the pose estimate. If more time is available, the robot can likely achieve a highly accurate pose with just a few scans. On the other hand, if a high amount of accuracy is absolutely required, the robot can do many small scans while avoiding an exhaustive scan of the whole object.</p>

</h2>

<div id="S6.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We presented a framework for combining pre-touch sensing with deep learning to improve object pose estimation. By using a deep neural network to detect regions that are rich in geometric features, we can obtain enough information to re-estimate the pose without scanning the whole object. In fact, we found that a single scan was often sufficient to improve the estimate. Our region detection network outperformed two baseline methods, and can typically estimate the pose of an object to within 0.5 cm after a sequence of scans. The network is trained using a new dataset that contains minimal human bias and is applicable to any pre-touch sensor that gathers geometric information. This dataset has been made publicly available.</p>
</div>
<div id="S6.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In future work, we would like to improve the accuracy of our method and integrate it into larger manipulation systems. With respect to accuracy, in this work, our network predicted regions that were individually well suited for pre-touch scanning. It is possible that a model that has memory or explicitly considers a sequence of regions could have better performance, such as a recurrent neural network. We also intend to examine the features learned by our model in more detail, as well as compare them to the features learned in other robot tasks, such as object detection and recognition.</p>
