<p id="id2.id1" class="ltx_p">Efficient object detection methods have recently received great attention in remote sensing. Although deep convolutional networks often have excellent detection accuracy, their deployment on resource-limited edge devices is difficult. Knowledge distillation (KD) is a strategy for addressing this issue since it makes models lightweight while maintaining accuracy. However, existing KD methods for object detection have encountered two constraints. First, they discard potentially important background information and only distill nearby foreground regions. Second, they only rely on the global context, which limits the student detector’s ability to acquire local information from the teacher detector. To address the aforementioned challenges, we propose Attention-based Feature Distillation (AFD), a new KD approach that distills both local and global information from the teacher detector. To enhance local distillation, we introduce a multi-instance attention mechanism that effectively distinguishes between background and foreground elements. This approach prompts the student detector to focus on the pertinent channels and pixels, as identified by the teacher detector. Local distillation lacks global information, thus attention global distillation is proposed to reconstruct the relationship between various pixels and pass it from teacher to student detector. The performance of AFD is evaluated on two public aerial image benchmarks, and the evaluation results demonstrate that AFD in object detection can attain the performance of other state-of-the-art models while being efficient.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Recently, due to the advancement of deep convolution neural networks (CNNs), significant progress has been made in object detection in remote sensing images <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>. Nevertheless, most of cutting-edge CNNs, require a large amount of processing power, preventing them from being used on mobile phones and embedded systems. Knowledge Distillation (KD) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>, Weight pruning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>, and model quantization <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>, are a few examples of the model compression strategies developed to address this problem.
KD in particular has gained popularity as a method for both model compression and model accuracy improvement because of its simplicity and efficacy. In the KD <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>, a heavyweight teacher network’s prediction logits are used to train a smaller, more manageable student network. Therefore, the teacher network’s soft labels can assist the student network in making decisions like the teacher network, leading to better performance despite the student network’s relatively few parameters.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The detection of objects and classification of object types in remote sensing images is complicated due to the presence of multiple objects distributed across various locations. This results in vagueness and imbalance in the details of detection. The representations of different positions, such as background, foreground, centers, or borders, may have varying contributions, making the task of KD challenging. The conventional KD approaches <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite> were established for the classification tasks (see Fig. <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ I Introduction ‣ Efficient Object Detection in Optical Remote Sensing Imagery via Attention-based Feature Distillation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>(a)), due to a lack of localization performance, cannot be used for the detection tasks. For example, hint learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite> is suggested to distill the transitional feature maps, but it does not pass the localization and classification knowledge of the teacher detector to the student detector. In order to address this concern, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite> introduces a new approach to object detection that improves feature extraction, information localization, and classification. Still, because of the disparity between the background and foreground, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite> is not able to efficiently extract the teacher’s knowledge. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>, a feature distillation method is developed, which uses ground truth to filter background regions in order to only perform distillation from the efficient foreground regions. However, this solution does not solve the issue of assigning equal weights to different target regions. Consequently, in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>, the authors suggest applying mechanism of attention to global features in order to build soft weighted masks, whereby these masks facilitate the access of information from certain and highly important locations.
However, we have noticed two main problems that arise when relying only on global feature contexts, potentially resulting in the loss of important information within the teacher’s features. Firstly, there is a tendency to primarily concentrate on foreground areas while disregarding the background. Neglecting the background is unfavorable for accurate object detection in remote sensing images <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite> as it contains valuable information that should not be overlooked. Therefore, efficiently balancing and using all information from both the foreground and the background is the key to boosting distillation performance in object detection. Second, some significant local features that are uniformly distributed in all regions might be overlooked given that the global mask-based approaches just pay attention to the features’ global contexts. Applying the softmax function to the global region, would produce an enhanced mask that supplies considerable attention to a foreground object while ignoring the other objects and background areas <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">To detect and classify objects in remote sensing images, we propose Attention-based Feature Distillation (AFD) to address the above constraints, as illustrated in Fig. <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ I Introduction ‣ Efficient Object Detection in Optical Remote Sensing Imagery via Attention-based Feature Distillation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>(b). In AFD, we propose a new multi-instance attention strategy that is based on the detector’s local and global context features. AFD applies an attention mechanism to local and global features to generate attention masks. In this procedure, the model estimates the attention of various channels and pixels of the teacher’s feature map, enabling the student detector to more focus to the teacher’s most significant channels and pixels. It also distills the relationship between various pixels from the teacher network and feeds it to the student network. To further extract the teacher’s information, the created mask is applied on the extracted features, the Region Proposal Network (RPN) features, the classification output, and the regression output.</p>

<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Additionally, we incorporate a feature map normalization technique and minimize the MSE loss between the normalized features. This approach aims to mitigate the adverse impact of magnitude disparities between the teacher and student detectors, as well as variations between different Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) layers and channels. In our AFD model, all loss functions exclusively operate on features, allowing for direct integration with different one/two-stage detectors. To evaluate AFD’s performance, on two challenging benchmark aerial datasets (DOTA <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>, NWPU VHR-10 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>), a comprehensive set of experiments were conducted.

These detectors often have a strong backbone, such as VGGs <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite> and ResNets <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite>. Consequently, some researches focus on creating lightweight backbone. MobileNet <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite> is a lightweight deep neural network that using depth-separable convolutions with a complementing search strategie.

But since classification and detection tasks are so distinct from one another, a lightweight backbone is not ideal for direct deployment. Hence, some lightweight detectors like Tiny-deeply supervised object detection <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite> and Pelee <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite> have developed specific backbones.

<p id="S2.SS1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">These lightweight detectors often do not provide good detection results when used for remote sensing imagery due to its complex background and multiscale objects. In light of this need, several deep learning-based detectors have been proposed for remote sensing images. To better focus on tiny objects, the authors of <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>]</cite> propose adopting the atrous spatial feature pyramid component and integrating multiscale context information through a loss weighted by region. Merging attention with deformable convolution for object detection is proposed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>]</cite>, via context-based deformable module on the basis of contextual information. Spatial misalignment between anchors and ground truth is one of the problems of object detection in remote sensing images. To address this issue, in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>]</cite> a unique pseudo-anchor proposal module is introduced. To efficiently address the problem of rotated objects, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite> proposes a method that learns rotation invariants and trains the network by applying additional constraints. In addition, to boost geospatial recognition accuracy, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>]</cite> proposes a network based on local-contextual feature fusion and <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite> introduce a new model to enhance feature maps quality for better object detection. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">38</a>]</cite>, a survey of object detection and tracking methods for remote sensing images is gathered that provides thoughts for models further development.
In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">39</a>]</cite>, a pyramid single-shot detector is proposed for small object detection in remote sensing images. To further enhance small object detection, in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib40" title="" class="ltx_ref">40</a>]</cite>, an interactive U-Net architecture is proposed which has higher feature learning by utilising object’s global context information. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib41" title="" class="ltx_ref">41</a>]</cite>, a detector is proposed that uses spatial-frequency channel features by incorporating both rotation-invariant channel features and original spatial channel features which enhances the system’s robustness, and accuracy. However, these detectors are difficult to deploy on devices with limited storage and computational power.</p>

<p id="S2.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">To develop precise and lightweight detectors for natural scenes, researchers have extensively utilize KD in recent years <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>. The application of KD in this particular task focuses on distilling the distinct locations of the detector. However, during the process of imitating the feature maps, the imbalanced distribution of foreground and background pixels is often disregarded, leading to inferior performance. To solve this problem, the authors of <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite> suggest an imitation technique for fine-grained features, which focuses the detector’s attention on the objects. To identify the central foreground pixels, a 2-dimension Gaussian mask is applied in the ground-truth regions for feature distillation in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib42" title="" class="ltx_ref">42</a>]</cite>. This strategy decreases the imbalance at the expense of eliminating the backgrounds.
On the other hand, recent analysis <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib43" title="" class="ltx_ref">43</a>, <a href="#bib.bib44" title="" class="ltx_ref">44</a>]</cite> has shown that the background areas contain important information. Specially, remote sensing objects are often connected to their environments. During the distillation process, it is important to pay attention to the areas around the objects and the background. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib45" title="" class="ltx_ref">45</a>]</cite>, Focal and Global Distillation is proposed that consists of, focal distillation for foreground-background separation, and global distillation for pixel relationship restoration.</p>

These distillation approaches continue to underestimate the importance of background, which result in loss of contextual information around the objects. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib44" title="" class="ltx_ref">44</a>]</cite> introduces a distillation mask-based method that focuses on discriminative patches by determining the differences between the teacher and student results. Moreover, in order to restrict the feature maps, a multiscale feature transition on the output of the FPN is applied. Similarly, in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>, a soft mask-based method is developed which extracts feature attention from its backbone. Conversely, current global attention masks generally overlook other significant regions as networks primarily have attention to small objects or regions. In order to further boost detection performance, we propose creating attention masks for all the local patches. These masks would direct attention to other important patches that contain local information.</p>

An effective feature distillation approach must considers magnitude difference while generating pairs for imitation. In addition, by analyzing the activation patterns, we observe that the dominating FPN layers and channels may directly interact with the student’s training phase and lead to sub-optimal performance, which is ignored by previous studies. To overcome this problem and optimize the learning process as shown in Fig. <a href="#S3.F3" title="Figure 3 ‣ III-A Local and Global Attention-based Mask ‣ III METHODOLOGY ‣ Efficient Object Detection in Optical Remote Sensing Imagery via Attention-based Feature Distillation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a>, we suggest first normalize the teacher’s features and the student ones. This involves transforming the features to have a zero mean and a unit variance. Once the normalization is complete, the next step is to minimize the mean squared error (MSE) between the normalized features. It is also important that the normalization follow the convolution property, to ensure that features are normalized uniformly at different regions of the feature map.

Through the distillation of local and global channel attention features, the channel attention loss is computed. Furthermore, the features obtained from local and global spatial attention are equivalent, while the local features are derived through splitting the global features in the spatial domain. Spatial attention loss, unlike channel attention loss, mainly uses global spatial attention features. Thus, we can write our channel attention and spatial attention losses (<math id="S3.SS2.p1.15.m15.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\ell_{cha}" display="inline"><semantics id="S3.SS2.p1.15.m15.1a"><msub id="S3.SS2.p1.15.m15.1.1" xref="S3.SS2.p1.15.m15.1.1.cmml"><mi mathvariant="normal" id="S3.SS2.p1.15.m15.1.1.2" xref="S3.SS2.p1.15.m15.1.1.2.cmml">ℓ</mi><mrow id="S3.SS2.p1.15.m15.1.1.3" xref="S3.SS2.p1.15.m15.1.1.3.cmml"><mi id="S3.SS2.p1.15.m15.1.1.3.2" xref="S3.SS2.p1.15.m15.1.1.3.2.cmml">c</mi><mo lspace="0em" rspace="0em" id="S3.SS2.p1.15.m15.1.1.3.1" xref="S3.SS2.p1.15.m15.1.1.3.1.cmml">​</mo><mi id="S3.SS2.p1.15.m15.1.1.3.3" xref="S3.SS2.p1.15.m15.1.1.3.3.cmml">h</mi><mo lspace="0em" rspace="0em" id="S3.SS2.p1.15.m15.1.1.3.1a" xref="S3.SS2.p1.15.m15.1.1.3.1.cmml">​</mo><mi id="S3.SS2.p1.15.m15.1.1.3.4" xref="S3.SS2.p1.15.m15.1.1.3.4.cmml">a</mi></mrow></msub><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S3.SS2.p1.15.m15.1b"><apply id="S3.SS2.p1.15.m15.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS2.p1.15.m15.1.1"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S3.SS2.p1.15.m15.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS2.p1.15.m15.1.1">subscript</csymbol><ci id="S3.SS2.p1.15.m15.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S3.SS2.p1.15.m15.1.1.2">ℓ</ci><apply id="S3.SS2.p1.15.m15.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S3.SS2.p1.15.m15.1.1.3"><times id="S3.SS2.p1.15.m15.1.1.3.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS2.p1.15.m15.1.1.3.1"></times><ci id="S3.SS2.p1.15.m15.1.1.3.2.cmml" xref="S3.SS2.p1.15.m15.1.1.3.2">𝑐</ci><ci id="S3.SS2.p1.15.m15.1.1.3.3.cmml" xref="S3.SS2.p1.15.m15.1.1.3.3">ℎ</ci><ci id="S3.SS2.p1.15.m15.1.1.3.4.cmml" xref="S3.SS2.p1.15.m15.1.1.3.4">𝑎</ci></apply></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S3.SS2.p1.15.m15.1c">\ell_{cha}</annotation></semantics></math>, <math id="S3.SS2.p1.16.m16.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\ell_{spa}" display="inline"><semantics id="S3.SS2.p1.16.m16.1a"><msub id="S3.SS2.p1.16.m16.1.1" xref="S3.SS2.p1.16.m16.1.1.cmml"><mi mathvariant="normal" id="S3.SS2.p1.16.m16.1.1.2" xref="S3.SS2.p1.16.m16.1.1.2.cmml">ℓ</mi><mrow id="S3.SS2.p1.16.m16.1.1.3" xref="S3.SS2.p1.16.m16.1.1.3.cmml"><mi id="S3.SS2.p1.16.m16.1.1.3.2" xref="S3.SS2.p1.16.m16.1.1.3.2.cmml">s</mi><mo lspace="0em" rspace="0em" id="S3.SS2.p1.16.m16.1.1.3.1" xref="S3.SS2.p1.16.m16.1.1.3.1.cmml">​</mo><mi id="S3.SS2.p1.16.m16.1.1.3.3" xref="S3.SS2.p1.16.m16.1.1.3.3.cmml">p</mi><mo lspace="0em" rspace="0em" id="S3.SS2.p1.16.m16.1.1.3.1a" xref="S3.SS2.p1.16.m16.1.1.3.1.cmml">​</mo><mi id="S3.SS2.p1.16.m16.1.1.3.4" xref="S3.SS2.p1.16.m16.1.1.3.4.cmml">a</mi></mrow></msub><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S3.SS2.p1.16.m16.1b"><apply id="S3.SS2.p1.16.m16.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS2.p1.16.m16.1.1"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S3.SS2.p1.16.m16.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS2.p1.16.m16.1.1">subscript</csymbol><ci id="S3.SS2.p1.16.m16.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S3.SS2.p1.16.m16.1.1.2">ℓ</ci><apply id="S3.SS2.p1.16.m16.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S3.SS2.p1.16.m16.1.1.3"><times id="S3.SS2.p1.16.m16.1.1.3.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS2.p1.16.m16.1.1.3.1"></times><ci id="S3.SS2.p1.16.m16.1.1.3.2.cmml" xref="S3.SS2.p1.16.m16.1.1.3.2">𝑠</ci><ci id="S3.SS2.p1.16.m16.1.1.3.3.cmml" xref="S3.SS2.p1.16.m16.1.1.3.3">𝑝</ci><ci id="S3.SS2.p1.16.m16.1.1.3.4.cmml" xref="S3.SS2.p1.16.m16.1.1.3.4">𝑎</ci></apply></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S3.SS2.p1.16.m16.1c">\ell_{spa}</annotation></semantics></math>) as:</p>

In addition to feature attention, which aims to sever the relationship between background and foreground, a global distillation approach is also proposed. This approach facilitates the transfer of key knowledge from the teacher detector to the student detector by leveraging the global relationships between neighboring pixels in the feature maps.
To compel the student detector to acquire knowledge about the pixels’ relationship from the teacher detector, we use GcNet <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib46" title="" class="ltx_ref">46</a>]</cite> for the purpose of extracting the global relation information from an image, as demonstrated in Fig. <a href="#S3.F4" title="Figure 4 ‣ III-A Local and Global Attention-based Mask ‣ III METHODOLOGY ‣ Efficient Object Detection in Optical Remote Sensing Imagery via Attention-based Feature Distillation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a>.

<p id="S3.SS4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">By directing attention towards the outputs of the students, the distillation process stimulates them to attain performance levels comparable to that of the teacher. Nonetheless, in the case of remote sensing images, where there exists a substantial imbalance between background and foreground, directly distilling the outputs from the teacher’s head may adversely affect the detection performance of the student. That’s why spatial attention masks are used to ensure that the response-based distillation is as accurate as possible. In particular, from the FPN we take the spatial attention masks (see Eq.

The achieved mAP values not only demonstrate competitive performance but also show instances where the student detectors outperform their respective teacher detectors. Notably, in the case of RetinaNet, the incorporation of our AFD yields a marginal yet discernible improvement in student detector performance, attributed to the efficacy of our attention module. These results show that our AFD is adaptable and can be effectively integrated into a wide range of detector architectures, yielding significant performance improvements.</p>

Upon observing the attention maps of both the teacher and student detectors, noticeable disparities in pixel distribution become apparent prior to applying the distillation process.

<div id="S4.SS6.SSS2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS6.SSS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Since the global attention mask is not distributed equally, KD only with the global feature attention module can extract information from large objects. Alternatively, we believe that small objects can be retrieved using local feature attention. We conduct different distillations using local and global attention masks to determine which is more effective. Based on the data in Table <a href="#S4.T6" title="TABLE VI ‣ IV-F Ablation Study ‣ IV EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS AND ANALYSIS ‣ Efficient Object Detection in Optical Remote Sensing Imagery via Attention-based Feature Distillation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">VI</span></a>, it is clear that local attention leads to a higher mAP than global attention. Despite that, the global attention results are inferior to the local ones, however, detection performance further improves when both local and global attention are used together. Following these observations, AFD’s local attention mask should work with the global attention mask to boost performance further.
Furthermore, by using normalization process, a large uniform value of loss weight can be obtained between the teacher and student detectors to maintain the balance of the detection and distillation losses. This balance is important to ensure that both the detection loss and the distillation loss have appropriate contributions to the overall learning process. Without normalization, one of the losses (detection or distillation) might dominate the training process due to large magnitude differences. This can lead to an imbalance in learning objectives and hinder the effectiveness of KD. Normalization mitigates this issue by ensuring that both losses have comparable magnitudes and influence the training process in a more balanced manner.</p>

The findings indicate the valuable contributions of both channel attention and spatial attention, highlighting their effective combination as a means to enhance overall performance.
Indeed, the teacher detector effectively guides the student detector’s focus towards important components by using a spatial and channel attention mask. We analyze the impact of different masks in Fig. <a href="#S4.F12" title="Figure 12 ‣ IV-F1 AFD Modules ‣ IV-F Ablation Study ‣ IV EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS AND ANALYSIS ‣ Efficient Object Detection in Optical Remote Sensing Imagery via Attention-based Feature Distillation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">12</span></a>. Each attention mask increases our model efficiency, particularly the spatial attention mask. However, the best result is obtained by combining both the masks.
Additionally, we evaluate the effects of the various loss functions of Eq.

<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">This paper introduced AFD, a new mask-based KD approach for target detection in remote sensing images that efficiently uses local and global attention methods to obtain local features and background information. To extract local features, we split the feature maps of input image into patches and apply attention methods. Our method enhances distillation performance by extracting both fine-grained features and more important background information from a range of objects. We showed that AFD outperforms other KD techniques when combined with the different detection systems. The detection results demonstrate that AFD surpasses state-of-the-art models performance and can be adopted in various detectors such as single-stage, two-stage, and even anchor-free. Moreover, we conducted an ablation experiment and analysis, demonstrating the importance of distilling local information from multiple regions for object detection. We believe our work represents a turning point for traditional KD approaches that only rely on global information, into more effective model that incorporate both local and global information.</p>
