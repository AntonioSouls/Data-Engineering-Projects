<p id="id10.id1" class="ltx_p">This paper proposes a novel concept to directly match feature descriptors extracted from 2D images with feature descriptors extracted from 3D point clouds. We use this concept to directly localize images in a 3D point cloud. We generate a dataset of matching 2D and 3D points and their corresponding feature descriptors, which is used to learn a Descriptor-Matcher classifier. To localize the pose of an image at test time, we extract keypoints and feature descriptors from the query image. The trained Descriptor-Matcher is then used to match the features from the image and the point cloud. The locations of the matched features are used in a robust pose estimation algorithm to predict the location and orientation of the query image.
We carried out an extensive evaluation of the proposed method for indoor and outdoor scenarios and with different types of point clouds to verify the feasibility of our approach.
Experimental results demonstrate that direct matching of feature descriptors from images and point clouds is not only a viable idea but can also be reliably used to estimate the 6-DOF poses of query cameras in any type of 3D point cloud in an unconstrained manner with high precision.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The numerous applications of 3D vision, such as augmented reality, autonomous driving and robotic locomotion, aided by the ever increasing computational power of modern machines have caused a steep increase of interest in 3D vision and its applications. The research in the field has also been predominantly motivated by the wide scale access to good quality and low cost 3D scanners, which has opened many new avenues.
However, despite of all the recent advancements of algorithms for 3D meshes and point clouds, there is still room for enhancements to match the performance of the systems designed for 2D images on similar tasks. Nearly all the state-of-the-art methods in the various fields of computer vision are designed for 2D images and there are also immense differences in the sizes of training datasets for 2D images compared to any of their 3D counterparts. This points to a need for the development of bridging techniques, which can make efficient uses of both 2D images and 3D point clouds or meshes. A technique that can fuse information from both 2D and 3D domains can benefit from the matured 2D vision as well as the contemporary advances in 3D vision. The complementary nature of 2D and 3D data can lead to an improved performance and efficiency in many potential applications, e.g., face recognition and verification, identification of objects or different regions of interest from coloured images in 3D maps, use of the 3D model of an object to locate it in an image in the presence of severe perspective distortion <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[Laga et al., <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">2018</a>]</cite>, as well as localization of a 2D images in a 3D point cloud.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">To move towards the goal of multi-domain information fusion from 2D and 3D domains, this paper proposes a novel approach to learn a framework to directly match feature descriptors extracted from 3D point clouds with those extracted from 2D images. This concept is used to localize images in point clouds directly generated from 3D scanners. To localize images, the developed framework is used to match 3D points of the point clouds to their corresponding pixels in 2D images with the help of multi-domain descriptor matching. The matched points between the images and the point clouds are then used to estimate the six degrees-of-freedom (DOF) position and orientation (pose) of images in the 3D world.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">6-DOF pose estimation is an important research topic due to its numerous applications such as augmented reality, place recognition, robotic grasping, navigation, robotic pose estimation as well as simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). Current techniques for camera pose estimation can be classified into two major categories: <span id="S1.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">(i)</span> Regression networks based methods and <span id="S1.p3.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">(ii)</span> Features based methods.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">The regression networks based methods (e.g. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Kendall et al. [<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">2015</a>], Kendall and Cipolla [<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">2017</a>], Walch et al. [<a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">2017</a>]</cite>), use deep neural networks to estimate the pose of the camera and consequently have high requirements for computational resources such as powerful GPUs and require a lot of training data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[Xin et al., <a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>]</cite> from different viewpoints to ensure that the poses of query cameras are sufficiently close to the training ones <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[Sattler et al., <a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>]</cite>. Moreover they scale poorly with the increase in the size of 3D models and usually run into the problems of non-convergence for end-to-end training <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[Brachmann and Rother, <a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">2018</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Features based method use hand-crafted approaches or deep learning methods to extract local or global features from images. An essential step in the state-of-the-art techniques in this category is the use of the Structure from Motion (SfM) pipeline <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[Schönberger and Frahm, <a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">2016</a>, Han et al., <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>]</cite> to create sparse 3D models from images (e.g. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[Li et al., <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">2010</a>, Sattler et al., <a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">2015</a>, <a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">2017</a>]</cite>). Structure from Motion pipelines provide a one-to-one correspondence between the points in the generated sparse point cloud and the pixels of the 2D images that were used to create the model. Several works use this information to localize images with respect to the 3D point cloud generated by SfM. However, model creation with SfM is a computationally expensive process which may be very time consuming depending on the number of images used and the quality of the point cloud to be generated. Models generated with SfM have especially poor quality for or miss out entirely on texture-less regions. Moreover, dependency on SfM generated point clouds renders such techniques futile for scenarios where point clouds have been obtained from 3D scanners. Now-a-days, high quality and user friendly 3D scanners (e.g. LIDAR, Microsoft Kinect, Matterport scanners and Faro 3D scanners) are available which can effectively render dense point clouds of large areas without the use of SfM. These point clouds are of better quality, not only because of their higher point density but also due to the reason that they can effectively capture bland surfaces that SfM based techniques tend to miss.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">To be able to directly localize 2D images in the point clouds generated from any 3D scanners, we propose a novel concept to directly match feature descriptors extracted from 3D point clouds with descriptors extracted from 2D images. The matched descriptors can then be used for 6-DOF camera localization of the image in the 3D point cloud.
Figure <a href="#S0.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ Unconstrained Matching of 2D and 3D Descriptors for 6-DOF Pose Estimation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a> shows a section of the dense point cloud of the Shop Facade dataset <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[Kendall et al., <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">2015</a>]</cite> along with a query image and the localization results of the proposed technique.
To match the feature descriptors from 2D and 3D domain, we generate a dataset of corresponding 3D and 2D descriptors to train a two-stage classifier called ‘Descriptor-Matcher’. For localization of a 2D image in a point cloud, we first use image feature extraction techniques such as Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[Lowe, <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">2004</a>]</cite> to extract keypoints and their descriptors from the 2D image. Similarly, we use techniques designed for point clouds <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[Guo et al., <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">2014</a>]</cite> such as 3D-SIFT key-points <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[Lowe, <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">2004</a>, Rusu and Cousins, <a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">2011</a>]</cite>, 3D-Harris key-points <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[Harris et al., <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">1988</a>, Laga et al., <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">2018</a>]</cite> and Rotation Invariant Features Transform (RIFT) descriptors <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[Lazebnik et al., <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">2005</a>]</cite> to extract 3D keypoints and descriptors from the point cloud.
The Descriptor-Matcher is then used to find the matching pairs of 3D and 2D descriptors and their corresponding keypoints. This results in a list of coordinates in the point cloud and their corresponding pixels in the query image. The resulting one-to-one matches are then used in a robust algorithm for 6-DOF pose estimation to find the location and orientation of the query camera in the 3D point cloud.

<p id="S2.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Features based methods extract convolutional or hand-crafted features from 2D images and use them in different manners to localize the images. However, many of these methods only estimate approximate locations and use number of inliers found with RANSAC <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[Fischler and Bolles, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">1981</a>]</cite> as a criterion for image registration e.g., a query image is considered as registered if the RANSAC stage of the method can find 12 inliers among the features for the query image. This is partly due to the fact that some datasets for image localization do not provide the ground truth position and orientation information for the query cameras. However, inlier count is not a reliable criterion and it does not represent the actual performance of any given method. Feature based methods can further be classified into two types of methods: Image retrieval based methods and SfM based methods.</p>

<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Li et al. [<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">2010</a>]</cite> compared the features extracted from the query 2D images with the 2D features corresponding to the points in the SfM model to localize the images.

<p id="S2.SS1.SSS2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">However, these methods can only work with point clouds generated with SfM based pipelines <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[Piasco et al., <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">2018</a>]</cite>. This is mainly due to the reason that the sparse point clouds generated with SfM save the corresponding information of the points and features from 2D images that were used to create the sparse SfM point cloud. SfM based methods rely on this information for pose estimation. Also some works use element-wise mean (or any other suitable function) of the feature descriptors of the points that were used to create a 3D point in the SfM point cloud as a 3D descriptor of that 3D point. Such an approximation of 3D features is dependent on the inherent information in the point cloud generated with SfM, which is not available if the point cloud had to be generated from a 3D scanner.</p>

<p id="S2.SS1.SSS2.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Structure from Motion is a computationally expensive and time consuming process. The point clouds generated with SfM are sparse and very noisy <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[Feng et al., <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>]</cite>. SfM models have especially poor quality at bland or texture-less regions and may miss out such areas altogether. Moreover, it requires multiple images of the same area from many different angles for good results, which is practically a difficult requirement, especially for large areas or buildings. Also the generated models are created on an arbitrary scale and it is not possible to determine the exact size of the model without extra information from other sources <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[Feng et al., <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>]</cite>. The availability of high quality 3D scanners has made it possible to capture large scale point clouds in an efficient manner without the need to capture thousands of images to be used for the SfM pipeline. Moreover, LIDAR and other 3D scanners are now becoming an essential part of robots, particularly for locomotion and grasping. Therefore, it is essential to develop methods that can estimate 6-DOF poses for cameras in point clouds captured from any scanner.</p>

<p id="S3.p2.1" class="ltx_p">At the core of our technique is a classifier, called ‘Descriptor-Matcher’, which is used to match the feature descriptors from 2D and 3D domain. Descriptor-Matcher is composed of two stages: coarse and fine. To train the Descriptor-Matcher, we need a dataset of 3D points and their corresponding pixel locations in the training images. It is impractical to manually create a dataset of matching 2D and 3D points, especially for large scales. To overcome this issue, we propose a method to automatically collect a large number of matching 3D and 2D points and their corresponding descriptors from a point cloud and a given set of 2D training images. The trained Descriptor-Matcher can then be used to localize a 2D query image in the point cloud.</p>

Projecting the 2D keypoints will involve the voxelization of the point cloud which is a computationally expensive process compared to its alternative (i.e., back ray tracing) for the task at hand. Therefore, for each image in the training set, we use the intrinsic and extrinsic matrix of the camera to trace back rays from the 3D key points <math id="S3.SS2.SSS1.p1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="keys_{3d}" display="inline"><semantics id="S3.SS2.SSS1.p1.1.m1.1a"><mrow id="S3.SS2.SSS1.p1.1.m1.1.1" xref="S3.SS2.SSS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml"><mi id="S3.SS2.SSS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.2" xref="S3.SS2.SSS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml">k</mi><mo lspace="0em" rspace="0em" id="S3.SS2.SSS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.1" xref="S3.SS2.SSS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml">​</mo><mi id="S3.SS2.SSS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.3" xref="S3.SS2.SSS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml">e</mi><mo lspace="0em" rspace="0em" id="S3.SS2.SSS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.1a" xref="S3.SS2.SSS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml">​</mo><mi id="S3.SS2.SSS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.4" xref="S3.SS2.SSS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.4.cmml">y</mi><mo lspace="0em" rspace="0em" id="S3.SS2.SSS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.1b" xref="S3.SS2.SSS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml">​</mo><msub id="S3.SS2.SSS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.5" xref="S3.SS2.SSS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.5.cmml"><mi id="S3.SS2.SSS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.5.2" xref="S3.SS2.SSS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.5.2.cmml">s</mi><mrow id="S3.SS2.SSS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.5.3" xref="S3.SS2.SSS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.5.3.cmml"><mn id="S3.SS2.SSS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.5.3.2" xref="S3.SS2.SSS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.5.3.2.cmml">3</mn><mo lspace="0em" rspace="0em" id="S3.SS2.SSS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.5.3.1" xref="S3.SS2.SSS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.5.3.1.cmml">​</mo><mi id="S3.SS2.SSS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.5.3.3" xref="S3.SS2.SSS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.5.3.3.cmml">d</mi></mrow></msub></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S3.SS2.SSS1.p1.1.m1.1b"><apply id="S3.SS2.SSS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS2.SSS1.p1.1.m1.1.1"><times id="S3.SS2.SSS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS2.SSS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.1"></times><ci id="S3.SS2.SSS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S3.SS2.SSS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.2">𝑘</ci><ci id="S3.SS2.SSS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S3.SS2.SSS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.3">𝑒</ci><ci id="S3.SS2.SSS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.4.cmml" xref="S3.SS2.SSS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.4">𝑦</ci><apply id="S3.SS2.SSS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.5.cmml" xref="S3.SS2.SSS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.5"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S3.SS2.SSS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.5.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS2.SSS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.5">subscript</csymbol><ci id="S3.SS2.SSS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.5.2.cmml" xref="S3.SS2.SSS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.5.2">𝑠</ci><apply id="S3.SS2.SSS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.5.3.cmml" xref="S3.SS2.SSS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.5.3"><times id="S3.SS2.SSS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.5.3.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS2.SSS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.5.3.1"></times><cn type="integer" id="S3.SS2.SSS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.5.3.2.cmml" xref="S3.SS2.SSS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.5.3.2">3</cn><ci id="S3.SS2.SSS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.5.3.3.cmml" xref="S3.SS2.SSS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.5.3.3">𝑑</ci></apply></apply></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S3.SS2.SSS1.p1.1.m1.1c">keys_{3d}</annotation></semantics></math> on the image.

However, as keypoints are extremely sparse, it is possible that points from the areas of the point cloud that are not visible in the image, get projected on the image. For example, if the camera is looking at a wall at a right angle and there is another wall behind the first one, then it is possible that the keypoints detected on the back wall get projected on the image. Theses false projections can create problems during the training of the Descriptor-Matcher as they result in the matching of locations between images and point clouds which are not the same and increase the number of false positives.

<p id="S3.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The generated dataset of corresponding 2D and 3D features is used to train the Descriptor-Matcher. The Descriptor-Matcher is composed of two stages: a coarse matcher and a fine matcher, connected in series (see Figure <a href="#S1.F2" title="Figure 2 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ Unconstrained Matching of 2D and 3D Descriptors for 6-DOF Pose Estimation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>). The two stages allow the Descriptor-Matcher to maintain both a high precision and computational efficiency at the same time, as explained in Section <a href="#S3.SS4" title="3.4 Testing ‣ 3 Proposed Technique ‣ Unconstrained Matching of 2D and 3D Descriptors for 6-DOF Pose Estimation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3.4</span></a>.
We evaluated several different classifiers for the coarse and fine stages including multi-layer fully connected Neural Networks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Khan et al. [<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">2018</a>]</cite>, Support Vector Machines with different kernels, Nearest Neighbour Classifiers with dictionary learning and Discriminant Analysis. However, we empirically found that Classification Tree <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[Breiman et al., <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">1984</a>]</cite> performs best for the coarse stage of the matcher, while for the fine stage only Random Forest classifier <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[Breiman, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">2001</a>]</cite> produces suitable results. Moreover, these classifiers have better robustness, speed, generalization capability and ability to handle over-fitting for the task at hand.</p>

Similarly, 3D keypoints and descriptors are extracted from the point cloud, if not already available. Then we concatenate the 2D descriptors of the query image and the 3D descriptors of the point cloud in a one-to-one fashion and use the two stage Descriptor-Matcher to find the matching and non-matching pairs. The pairs of descriptors are first tested by the coarse matcher and only the pairs with positive results for matches are passed to the fine-matcher. As the coarse matcher is composed of a single classification tree, it greatly reduces the number of pairs which need to be tested by the fine matcher, at only a small computational cost, thus greatly decreasing the prediction time of the algorithm.
Then, we retrieve the corresponding keypoints for the descriptor pairs positively matched by the fine-matcher and use them as matching locations from the image and the point cloud for pose estimation.</p>

The images in these datasets were captured at different times under different lighting and weather conditions and contain a lot of urban clutter which increases the challenges for precise localization of camera poses.
As the Cambridge Landmarks Database does not contain dense point clouds, we used the COLMAP’s Multi View Stereo Pipeline <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[Schönberger et al., <a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">2016</a>]</cite> to generate dense point clouds for these datasets.

Indoor localization of images is a more challenging problem compared to the outdoor settings <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[Sun et al., <a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">2017</a>]</cite>. Due to similar items (e.g., furniture) and the same construction patterns (e.g., cubicle shape of rooms, similar patterns on floor or ceiling, stairs), it is possible that different regions of the building look very similar, which greatly increases the possibility of wrong matches and incorrect camera pose estimation. On the other hand, indoor localization is a more useful application of image localization as many of the traditional localization methods, such as GPS based localization, do not work properly in indoor settings. To evaluate the performance of our technique on practical indoor localization scenarios, we used the Kitchen and Living Room Datasets from the Stanford RGB Localization Database <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[Valentin et al., <a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">2016</a>]</cite> and Baidu Indoor Localization dataset <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[Sun et al., <a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">2017</a>]</cite>.

<p id="S4.SS3.SSS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The Baidu Indoor Localization Dataset <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[Sun et al., <a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">2017</a>]</cite> is composed of a 3D point cloud of a multi-storey shopping mall created with the scans from a LIDAR scanner and a database of images with ground truth information for camera positions and orientations. The 3D point cloud contains more than 67 million points. Figure <a href="#S4.F4" title="Figure 4 ‣ 4.3.2 Living Room Dataset ‣ 4.3 Indoor Datasets ‣ 4 Experiments and Analysis ‣ Unconstrained Matching of 2D and 3D Descriptors for 6-DOF Pose Estimation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a> shows different views of the point cloud of the mall. The images in the dataset are captured with different cameras and smart phones and at different times which increases the complexity of the dataset. Moreover, many of the images contain occlusions due to the persons shopping in the mall.

<div id="S4.SS4.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The proposed technique for image localization in point clouds is based on a novel concept of directly matching the descriptors extracted from images and point clouds. The SfM based techniques are based on the matching of 2D features and require the point cloud to be generated from SfM pipeline. On the other hand, our technique can work with point clouds created with any 3D scanner or generated with any method and has no dependency on any information from SfM.</p>
</div>
<div id="S4.SS4.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS4.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The network based regression methods train directly to regress the poses of the images. However, this causes the networks to over-fit on the ground truth poses. Therefore at test time, they only produce good results for the images with poses close to the training ones <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[Sattler et al., <a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>]</cite>. In our technique, training of the Descriptor-Matcher is carried out on the feature descriptors with no information of the poses or the location of the points. This ensures that the Descriptor-Matcher does not over-fit on the training poses, rather it learns to find a mapping between the 2D and 3D descriptors. The final pose estimation is based on the principles of geometry which produce better pose estimates compared to end-to-end trained methods <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[Sattler et al., <a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>]</cite>. Therefore, the proposed method benefits from the non-reliance on SfM pipeline like the network based methods, as well as the ability to use geometry based pose estimation similar to the SfM based methods.</p>

The results of the compared methods are not available for Baidu Indoor Localization Dataset or Stanford RGB Localization Database.
Our proposed method achieved competitive or superior localization accuracy to the state-of-the-art methods for 6-DOF pose estimation on all the datasets.

<div id="S5.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">This paper proposed a novel method to directly match descriptors from 2D images with those from 3D point clouds, where the descriptors are extracted using 2D and 3D feature extraction techniques, respectively.
We have shown that direct matching of 2D and 3D feature descriptors is an unconstrained and reliable method for 6-DOF pose estimation in point clouds.
Our approach results in a pipeline which is much simpler compared to SfM or network based methods.
Extensive quantitative evaluation has demonstrated that the proposed method achieved competitive performance with the state-of-the-art methods in the field.
Moreover, unlike SfM based techniques, the proposed method can be used with point clouds generated with any type of 3D scanners and can work in both indoor and outdoor scenarios.</p>
