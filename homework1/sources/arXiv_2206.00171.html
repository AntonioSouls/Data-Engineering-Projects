<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">3D hand pose estimation (HPE) is the process of locating the joints of the hand in 3D from any visual input. HPE has recently received an increased amount of attention due to its key role in a variety of human-computer interaction applications. Recent HPE methods have demonstrated the advantages of employing videos or multi-view images, allowing for more robust HPE systems. Accordingly, in this study, we propose a new method to perform Sequential learning with Transformer for Hand Pose (SeTHPose) estimation. Our SeTHPose pipeline begins by extracting visual embeddings from individual hand images. We then use a transformer encoder to learn the sequential context along time or viewing angles and generate accurate 2D hand joint locations. Then, a graph convolutional neural network with a U-Net configuration is used to convert the 2D hand joint locations to 3D poses. Our experiments show that SeTHPose performs well on both hand sequence varieties, temporal and angular. Also, SeTHPose outperforms other methods in the field to achieve new state-of-the-art results on two public available sequential datasets, STB and MuViHand.</p>

<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Various human-computer interaction applications including gaming, autonomous driving, automatic sign-language recognition, and others, rely upon the estimation of hand joint locations—i.e., hand pose estimation (HPE)—from input visual data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>. Despite the considerable improvements in HPE methods with the help of deep learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>, many methods still struggle to deal with challenges such as
occlusions (which could happen by a body part or by a part of the hand itself, called self-occlusion), large number of possible hand poses (large pose space), large number of hand shapes, various skin colors, and sharp camera viewpoints.</p>

<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Despite sequential information (time/view) often being ignored for HPE, we believe their effective learning and aggregation could lead to more robust contextualized representations and ultimately more accurate HPE. While recurrent neural networks have been used in the past for learning such time/view contextual information <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>, <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>, the Transformer self-attention <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite>, which has recently
shown remarkable results in various computer vision tasks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>, <a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>, <a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite>,
appears to be a strong candidate for learning sequential information across time or views for enhancing 3D HPE.
As a result, we propose a new HPE method called <span id="S1.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_framed ltx_framed_underline">Se</span>quential learning with <span id="S1.p3.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_framed ltx_framed_underline">T</span>ransformer for <span id="S1.p3.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_framed ltx_framed_underline">H</span>and <span id="S1.p3.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_framed ltx_framed_underline">P</span>ose (SeTHPose) estimation.
Our model first uses a CNN encoder to generate the spatial embeddings for each hand frame, followed by a transformer encoder to learn the contextual relations of the hand embeddings across time or views (Figures <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ I Introduction ‣ Learning Sequential Contexts using Transformer for 3D Hand Pose Estimation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>(a) and (b) demonstrate the different contextual data types, while (c) demonstrates a sample 3D pose output). Next, an MLP is used for estimating the 2D hand joint locations. This is followed by a graph convolutional U-network to convert the learned 2D structures to 3D hand joint locations.
We validate our model on two publicly available <span id="S1.p3.1.5" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">sequential</span> datasets, STB <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite> and MuViHand <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite>, and achieve state-of-the-art results by outperforming previous works in the area. Moreover, we perform additional experiments, such as ablation studies, to evaluate the impact of contextual learning within our model. While a few new techniques have been recently proposed to use transformers for HPE <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>, their use has been solely limited for obtaining better single-image embeddings or joint locations, while our method uses the transformer component to learn the contextual information across time or view sequences.
To the best of our knowledge, SeTHPose is the first method that learns <span id="S1.p3.1.6" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">sequential contextual information</span> with transformer for 3D HPE.</p>

<p id="S2.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In some prior HPE literature, estimating 2D hand locations had been used as an intermediary step for estimating 3D poses from RGB images.

Similarly, in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>, the depth data was measured in addition to the initial 2D heatmaps, from which the 3D hand pose was calculated.

In our model, a ResNet is first used to encode the input images and produce individual hand frame embeddings. Then, inspired by recent works in other fields of computer vision that have used transformers to learn sequential information across time <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>, <a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>]</cite> or space <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>, <a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>]</cite>, we use a transformer encoder to learn the contextual sequential (temporal or angular) information.
The output of the transformer is then used to produce 2D hand joint locations. SeTHPose then passes the estimated 2D joints to a Graph U-Net to estimate the 3D hand poses. In the following sub-sections we discuss each of the main components of SeTHPose in detail.</p>

By design, this encoder does not incorporate contextual sequential information because it only focuses on single frames. Thus, we need another component in our model to combine the individual embeddings in order to learn the surrounding context for each input frame. This leads to the use of a transformer encoder in SeTHPose, which we describe in the following sub-section.</p>

It can be observed that the performance of our method drops in the absence of learning contextual information, indicating that temporal and multi-view sequences provide additional valuable data points which can be effectively and successfully exploited by the transformer in our model. In particular, the EPE increases by around 25 <span id="S4.SS5.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">mm</span> for the STB dataset, and by an average of 7 <span id="S4.SS5.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">mm</span> and 27 <span id="S4.SS5.p1.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">mm</span> for MuViHand dataset in the cross-subject and cross-activity schemes, respectively.</p>

<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We present SeTHPose, a model capable of exploiting sequential hand data (video or multi-view images) using transformers to perform accurate 3D HPE. Our model includes multiple components to encode individual hand frames, learn the sequential contexts, and estimate 3D hand poses. Our model is evaluated by a number of experiments, which include comparisons with state-ofthe-art methods using publicly available datasets and ablated baselines. These experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method by outperforming other solutions in the area.</p>
