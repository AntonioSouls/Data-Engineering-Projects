<p id="id19.id1" class="ltx_p">Fully supervised object detection requires training images in which all instances are annotated. This is actually impractical due to the high labor and time costs and the unavoidable missing annotations. As a result, the incomplete annotation in each image could provide misleading supervision and harm the training. Recent works on sparsely annotated object detection alleviate this problem by generating pseudo labels for the missing annotations. Such a mechanism is sensitive to the threshold of the pseudo label score. However, the effective threshold is different in different training stages and among different object detectors. Therefore, the current methods with fixed thresholds have sub-optimal performance, and are difficult to be applied to other detectors. In order to resolve this obstacle, we propose a <span id="id19.id1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Calibrated Teacher</span>, of which the confidence estimation of the prediction is well calibrated to match its real precision. In this way, different detectors in different training stages would share a similar distribution of the output confidence, so that multiple detectors could share the same fixed threshold and achieve better performance. Furthermore, we present a simple but effective <span id="id19.id1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Focal IoU Weight</span> (FIoU) for the classification loss. FIoU aims at reducing the loss weight of false negative samples caused by the missing annotation, and thus works as the complement of the teacher-student paradigm. Extensive experiments show that our methods set new state-of-the-art under all different sparse settings in COCO. <span id="id19.id1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" style="color:#000000;">Code will be available at <span class="ltx_ref ltx_nolink ltx_url ltx_ref_self"><span id="id19.id1.3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_upright">https://github.com/Whileherham/CalibratedTeacher</span></span></span>.</p>

<div id="Sx1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Remarkable progress in fully supervised object detection has been witnessed in recent years. In order to train such an object detector, a large number of training images are required, and bounding boxes in each image are supposed to be exhaustively annotated. However, it could be practically infeasible due to the high labor and time costs with the volume of datasets increasing, and some of the annotations would be unavoidably missing due to human error.</p>
</div>
<div id="Sx1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Sparsely annotated object detection (SAOD) aims to handle such a task that each training image may miss some box annotations. It is highly relevant to a popular topic called semi-supervised object detection (SSOD), whose training data consists of a fully labeled part and an unlabeled part. It is worth mentioning that these two tasks are complementary, since even in the semi-supervised settings, the case of missing labels may still appear in the part of labeled data.

</figure>
<div id="Sx1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Considering the relevance of these two tasks, we start from one of the most widely studied methods called “pseudo labeling” in semi-supervised learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Tarvainen and Valpola <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">2017</a>)</cite>.
Pseudo labeling utilizes the predictions of a teacher network to produce supervision signals over unlabeled data for a student network. Therefore, it is natural to transfer this idea to the case of sparse annotation. In terms of pseudo labeling, the main difference between the semi-supervised task and sparsely annotated task is that the image in the former is either fully annotated or completely unlabeled, while in the later, it is unknown how well the image is labeled. In order to guarantee the precision of pseudo labels, most of previous methods for the semi-supervised task obtain pseudo labels by taking a high score threshold to filter the detection boxes from teacher network. As for the sparsely annotated task, an additional IoU filter is indispensable to drop the predictions which have high overlap with the sparse annotations. The remain boxes along with the sparse annotations compose the final supervision signal.</p>
</div>
<div id="Sx1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Following this paradigm, some recent works have tried to generate pseudo labels for the missing annotation boxes to train the model. However, all of the previous methods <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Wang et al. <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>; Rambhatla et al. <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022</a>)</cite> adopt a fixed score threshold, which is usually set to a high value, to guarantee only a few accurate pseudo boxes could survive. Such a high score threshold drops lots of moderately confident predictions, which may contain more valuable information (e.g. tiny objects, with rare classes, partially occluded objects), leading to insufficient learning on the missing label. Therefore, a fixed score threshold is not a good choice.</p>
</div>
<div id="Sx1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Nevertheless, it is non-trivial to select a better strategy of score threshold, since we find the meaning of confidence score is changing all the time. Firstly we compare the most effective thresholds in different training stages. Concretely, we train RetinaNet under the teacher-student paradigm with six different thresholds. During training we evaluate these models every 36k iterations, of which the best model is utilized to initialize all the models for the next stage. As shown in Fig. <a href="#Sx1.F2" title="Figure 2 ‣ Introduction ‣ Calibrated Teacher for Sparsely Annotated Object Detection" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a> (a) that the lower thresholds result in the better performance in the earlier stage, but the advantage is narrowing with the training going on. Finally the relatively high thresholds perform better at the end of the training, while the lowest threshold performs worse than not using pseudo labels.</p>
</div>
<div id="Sx1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">Besides, as shown in Fig. <a href="#Sx1.F2" title="Figure 2 ‣ Introduction ‣ Calibrated Teacher for Sparsely Annotated Object Detection" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a> (b), the precision of candidates decreases gradually, which reflects that a stricter threshold is required to ensure the quality of pseudo labels.</p>
</div>
<div id="Sx1.p7" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx1.p7.1" class="ltx_p">Furthermore, there are numerous factors impacting the meaning of confidence score predictions. Fig. <a href="#Sx1.F2" title="Figure 2 ‣ Introduction ‣ Calibrated Teacher for Sparsely Annotated Object Detection" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a> (c)<math id="Sx1.p7.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\sim" display="inline"><semantics id="Sx1.p7.1.m1.1a"><mo id="Sx1.p7.1.m1.1.1" xref="Sx1.p7.1.m1.1.1.cmml">∼</mo><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="Sx1.p7.1.m1.1b"><csymbol cd="latexml" id="Sx1.p7.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="Sx1.p7.1.m1.1.1">similar-to</csymbol></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="Sx1.p7.1.m1.1c">\sim</annotation></semantics></math>(e) show the score distribution of RetinaNet <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Lin et al. <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">2017</a>)</cite>, FCOS <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Tian et al. <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>)</cite>, and Faster R-CNN <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Ren et al. <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">2015</a>)</cite> respectively. A wide variation is exhibited due to the different types of loss function(e.g. focal loss v.s. cross entropy loss), different score formulations (e.g. classification score multiply with centerness in FCOS), different model designs(e.g. single stage v.s. two stages). As shown in Fig. <a href="#Sx1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ Introduction ‣ Calibrated Teacher for Sparsely Annotated Object Detection" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a> (a), it turns into an engineering task to search for a proper threshold strategy to filter out the correct pseudo labels.</p>
</div>
<div id="Sx1.p8" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx1.p8.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we propose to give a unified and specific meaning for the confidence score to simplify the selection of score threshold in pseudo label generating. Inspired by the idea of confidence calibration <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Guo et al. <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">2017</a>)</cite>, We propose to calibrate the predictions of the teacher model during training. After calibration. the confidence score is supposed to reflect the expectation of its precision, which is decoupled from the characters and capabilities of detectors. As shown in Fig. <a href="#Sx1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ Introduction ‣ Calibrated Teacher for Sparsely Annotated Object Detection" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a> (b), it becomes easier to set a unified threshold for different training stages and detectors after calibration.</p>
</div>
<div id="Sx1.p9" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx1.p9.1" class="ltx_p">Besides, in order to guarantee the precision of pseudo labels, it is impossible to cover all possible candidates. Hence there still exist some missing annotations not recalled. To resolve this problem, we propose a <span id="Sx1.p9.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Focal IoU Weight</span>(FIoU) for the classification loss. Supposing the missing annotations tend to have a low IoU with the existing annotations, FIoU down-weights the negative samples who have low IoU with the existing ground truth, with a mechanism similar to focal loss <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Lin et al. <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">2017</a>)</cite>. Therefore, FIoU could be regarded as the complement of SAOD methods.</p>

<p id="Sx2.SS0.SSS0.Px1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">is one of the most fundamental problems in computer vision.

Besides, anchor-free methods draw attention gradually, which usually predict the bounding boxes based on the center points <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Zhou, Wang, and Krähenbühl <a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>)</cite>, pseudo center points <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Tian et al. <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>)</cite> or corner points <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Law and Deng <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">2018</a>)</cite>. with the development of transformer, query-based methods <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Carion et al. <a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>; Zhu et al. <a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite> are proposed to model the detection as a set prediction problem. Meanwhile, there exist numerous works on the design of loss function to focus on the class imbalance <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Lin et al. <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">2017</a>)</cite>, the scale variation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Yu et al. <a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">2016</a>; Rezatofighi et al. <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>)</cite> and uncertainty measurement <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Li et al. <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite>. However, numerous architectures and training strategies bring great difficulty to design a unified method for sparsely annotated object detection.

Although confidence calibration is rarely explored in object detection <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Kuppers et al. <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite>, the methodology could be referenced from image classification, such as temperature scaling <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Guo et al. <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">2017</a>)</cite>, Plat scaling <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Platt et al. <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">1999</a>)</cite>, histogram binning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Zadrozny and Elkan <a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">2001</a>)</cite>, Bayesian binning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Naeini, Cooper, and Hauskrecht <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">2015</a>)</cite>, etc. However, all of these methods require an extra fully annotated validation set to optimize the calibrator after training. On the contrary, we optimize the calibrator with the sparsely annotated training set only, which releases the dependence on the extra clean data and makes it possible to update the calibrator during training. To our best knowledge, this is the first time to introduce the idea of confidence calibration into the sparsely annotated object detection.</p>

<p id="Sx3.SSx3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In order to address the shortcomings of the dynamic threshold, we first analyse the mechanism behind this method. An ideal threshold is closely related to the confidence distribution of the teacher network’s prediction, which varies in the different training stages and among different detectors. The dynamic strategy tries to fit the variation of this distribution and adjust the threshold accordingly. However, the variation of confidence distribution is hard to parameterized, which brings great difficulty of designing a pre-defined rules of adjusting threshold. </p>
</div>
<div id="Sx3.SSx3.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx3.SSx3.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Hence, it is unwise to leverage a pre-defined rules to adapt to the confidence distribution changing continuously. Instead, we turn to focus on the adjustment of confidence distribution and leave the threshold unchanged. This is ideally equivalent to dynamic threshold. However, with the fixed threshold, all we need is to calibrate the confidence distribution into some specific form, which is more robust and easier than adapting the threshold to a varying and non-parametric distribution. Furthermore, once the confidence is calibrated, an effective threshold could also work in other cases, <span id="Sx3.SSx3.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">i.e.</span>, in other training stages or using other detectors.</p>

<p id="Sx3.SSx3.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Then the problem turns into what the target confidence distribution looks like and how we transform the original distribution to that. For the first problem, considering that the precision is the most direct and crucial indicator of the quality of pseudo labels, we expect the confidence score to reflect the real precision. This is the same as the target of confidence calibration in object detection <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Kuppers et al. <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite>, which defines a calibrated confidence (unbiased confidence) as follows.</p>

<p id="Sx3.SSx4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In the field of model calibration, the parameters of calibrators are optimized with the validation set at the end of training. However, there exist two extra challenges in our framework. The first challenge is that there is no validation set available. Although we could utilize training set instead, it is actually noisy due to the missing annotation. The calibrator optimized with such dataset would tend to output the low confidence, as it is trained to reduce the confidence of some correct prediction assigned with the missing ground truth. The second challenge is that the meaning of the score prediction is varying during training, and thus we have to calibrate the teacher network timely, which requires the calibrate model is updating during the training stage.</p>
</div>
<div id="Sx3.SSx4.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx3.SSx4.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In order to tackle the first challenge, we divide the teacher’s prediction in the training set into two parts by an IoU filter. Bounding boxes having a high IoU with at least one of the existing ground truth are more likely to be assigned to the sparse annotation, while those having a low IoU with all the existing annotations possibly cover the missing annotation. Theoretically, the statistics of the two parts are similar, therefore we could optimize the calibrator with the sparse annotations and the corresponding predictions (the high IoU parts).</p>

<p id="Sx3.SSx5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Although the calibrated teacher is able to generate pseudo labels properly, it is impossible to cover all the missing annotation. On the one hand, even the model trained with the complete annotation could fail to detect all instances in the training set. On the other hand, the high recall of missing annotation could also result in the low precision, since we have to set a low threshold and thus preserve many false positive predictions. Therefore, the missing but not recalled annotation would still make some positive samples regarded as negative samples. These false negative samples have little influence on the two-stage detectors like Faster R-CNN due to the sampling strategy. However, for the one-stage detector like RetinaNet, they are unlikely to be ignored. Furthermore, the false negative samples usually have a relatively high confidence of foreground, they would further harm the training due to the commonly used focal loss.</p>

<div id="Sx3.SSx5.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx3.SSx5.p2.6" class="ltx_p">As a result, it is necessary to reduce the influence of false negative samples. Inspired by <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Zhang et al. <a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite>, we adopt the IoU with the existing ground truth as the criterion for judging negative samples. It is safe to assign a high weight to those negative samples with high IoU with the existing ground truth labels, as they are less likely to match the missing labels, and vice versa. Analogous to the mechanism of focal loss, where high weights are assigned to negative samples with high foreground confidence, we propose a <span id="Sx3.SSx5.p2.6.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Focal IoU Weight</span> (FIoU) for the classification loss.

<p id="Sx4.SSx3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this subsection we compare our methods with state-of-the-art. Tab. <a href="#Sx4.T1" title="Table 1 ‣ Implementation Details ‣ Experimental Results ‣ Calibrated Teacher for Sparsely Annotated Object Detection" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a> reports the results in Split-1,2,3. It could be seen that our framework with both RetinaNet and Faster R-CNN could set new state-of-the-art in all sparse settings. Specifically, when adopting RetinaNet as the detector, our methods surpass the counterparts by a large margin (12.8 mAP at most and 7.3 mAP on average). Meanwhile, our methods with Faster R-CNN have the superiority of 3.1 mAP at most and 1.6 mAP on average. It is encouraging to find that our framework improves the performance of baseline methods significantly, which is close to the models trained with the complete training set. This inspires us that in order to relieve the burden of annotating, a sparsely annotated dataset could replace the completely annotated one to some extent. Furthermore, different from the recent work <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Rambhatla et al. <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022</a>)</cite>, which could only be applied on two-stage detectors due to the dependence on the architecture modification of RPN, our framework is model-agnostic, which is convenient and flexible for practical application. In conclusion, the strong performance demonstrates the effectiveness of our methods.</p>

It could be found that the dynamic threshold does not always outperform the fixed threshold. This might result from the difficulty of designing a proper dynamic strategy, as different detectors may not share the same effective strategy due to the different confidence distribution. However, Calibrated Teacher is able to surpass both dynamic threshold and fixed threshold in all three detectors, even without adjusting hyper-parameters according to the property of them. Hence we could conclude that Calibrated Teacher is a general framework with better performance. It simplifies the design of hyper-parameters by providing an adaptive strategy to select proper pseudo labels in different training stages, and making it possible that different detectors could share the same hyper-parameters.</p>

Furthermore, when combined these two modules, the performance gain is greater than the sum of the respective gains. Taking experiments in Hard set as an example, Calibrated Teacher and Focal IoU could only bring the improvement of 0.2 mAP and 0.3 mAP, but the combination could result in a performance gain of 1.1 mAP. This is because the two modules are complementary. Focal IoU down-weights the false negative anchors to avoid great misleading supervision, which is helpful to train a better model to generate better pseudo labels.</p>

In the 2nd column we miss one instance in a pile of donuts. This is possibly because the missing donuts are too close to be distinguished from its neighbors, making its corresponding prediction refused by the IoU filter. In the 3rd column the person behind the mesh wire is not recalled, which might result from the great variation in color. In the 4th column we fail to find the ball in the left mostly due to its extremely tiny volume. Finally the right person is excluded from the pseudo labels, which is possibly because only an arm is visible in the picture. Although our method fails to recall some instances, it is actually unavoidable when guarantee the precision of pseudo labels, which is why we need the Focal IoU Weight as a complement.</span></p>

<div id="Sx5.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this work we experimentally explain the obstacle of recent methods of sparsely annotated object detection (SAOD). Hence we propose a Calibrated Teacher that adjusts the confidence of the teacher network’s prediction adaptively to provide reliable pseudo labels. We further present the Focal IoU Weight as a complement to down-weight the false negative samples. Extensive methods show that our methods not only outperform the state-of-the-art counterparts, but also simplify the threshold tuning greatly. One limitation is that we only adopt a simple strategy for calibration, it is unclear that whether other advanced calibrators could help the performance. We leave it for future work.</p>
