<p id="id16.id1" class="ltx_p">As a general model compression paradigm, feature-based knowledge distillation allows the student model to learn expressive features from the teacher counterpart. In this paper, we mainly focus on designing an effective feature-distillation framework and propose a spatial-channel adaptive masked distillation (AMD) network for object detection. More specifically, in order to accurately reconstruct important feature regions, we first perform attention-guided feature masking on the feature map of the student network, such that we can identify the important features via spatially adaptive feature masking instead of random masking in the previous methods. In addition, we employ a simple and efficient module to allow the student network channel to be adaptive, improving its model capability in object perception and detection. In contrast to the previous methods, more crucial object-aware features can be reconstructed and learned from the proposed network, which is conducive to accurate object detection. The empirical experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method: with the help of our proposed distillation method, the student networks report 41.3%, 42.4%, and 42.7% mAP scores when RetinaNet, Cascade Mask-RCNN and RepPoints are respectively used as the teacher framework for object detection, which outperforms the previous state-of-the-art distillation methods including FGD and MGD.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Recent years have witnessed successful and pervasive applications of Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in various computer vision tasks. However, deep CNNs usually cost a huge amount of computational resources in pursuit of higher performance, which adversely affects their deployment in practical applications and leads to severe parameter redundancy.</p>

<figcaption class="ltx_caption"><span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_figure">Figure 1: </span>Different regions are quantified with varying attention scores in the feature map of teacher model. The regions with higher scores encode the region importance and should outweigh the low-score regions in the feature masking.</figcaption>
</figure>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">It is therefore necessary to transfer the dark knowledge learned in the complex networks (teacher) to another lightweight network (student). This is also termed as knowledge distillation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite> which allows the student model to generate expressive features learned from the teacher model. Thus, it is more preferable to deploy the student model with compact network architecture sacrificing minimal loss of performance.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">The earliest distillation algorithms function mainly at the output head. The representative examples include logit-based distillation for classification and head-based distillation for detection <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>. Recently, a more common distillation strategy emerges as feature-based distillation mechanism. Since only the head or projector after the generated feature varies within different networks, the feature-based distillation approaches can potentially be employed in a variety of tasks. Therefore, it has become a prominent line of research for both model compression and performance improvement due to its simplicity and efficacy.</p>

The auxiliary clues are then fused with the output from the generation block via a Hadamard product, such that the generated feature from the student model is channel adaptive.</figcaption>

<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">In object detection, in particular, a variety of feature-based distillation approaches have been developed. The earlier research, such as FitNet <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>, performs distillation at the global level. FGFI <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite> operates by distilling the features of high IoU between ground truth and anchors. FGD <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite> was developed to separate distillation of foreground and background.
Recent research suggests it is preferable for the student model to reconstruct and learn expressive features from the teacher model in the first place instead of following the teacher for generating competitive representations. For instance, MGD <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite> was proposed to randomly mask pixels in the feature map of student network, leading to reconstructed features of the teacher model via a simple block.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Although MGD further improves the feature distillation by reconstructing the features of masked areas, the masked regions are generated in a random manner. This random operation fails to identify the region-specific importance, and is likely to cause the student model to generate features of the teacher in unimportant regions. As illustrated in Fig. <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ I Introduction ‣ AMD: Adaptive Masked Distillation for Object Detection" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>, the importance of different regions in the feature map of a teacher model can be quantified using the region-specific attention scores. Only the regions with higher scores play critical role in feature masking while the low-score regions should be downplayed.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">To alleviate the above-mentioned drawback, we propose an adaptive masked distillation (AMD) framework which enjoys object-aware spatial and channel adaptivity. On the one hand, we perform attention-guided spatial masking instead of random masking on the feature map of the student network. More specifically, we first learn a spatial attention map from the feature map of the teacher model, producing a region-specific mask. Then, the feature of the student network is adaptively masked by using this attention map. Benefiting from this selective feature masking, it allows subsequent generation block to focus on those adaptively masked important areas, leading to robust and expressive representations. On the other hand, to further explore the object-awareness capability, we leverage a simple and effective SE layer <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite> for modeling the channel attention of the resulting feature of the teacher model. The learned clue and the output from the generation block of students will be fused via a Hadamard product, achieving desirable object-aware channel adaptivity.</p>

<div id="S2.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">As one fundamental vision task, object detection aims to determine the category and location of the objects in an image. Over recent years, the success of CNNs has enormously advanced the research in object detection. In general, the detectors based on deep CNNs can be classified into three categories including anchor-based detectors <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>, anchor-free detectors <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite> and end-to-end detectors <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>. In particular, anchor-based detection models are divided into two-stage <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite> and one-stage detectors <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>. The former detection method, represented by R-CNN like <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite> algorithms, has a higher detection accuracy, whereas its inference speed is usually unsatisfactory due to expensive computational costs incurred by region proposal network (RPN). As a result, it is impractical for some real-time scenarios. In contrast, one-stage detectors directly perform classification and regression on the anchors without generating proposals beforehand. Thus, they run faster with guaranteed detection performance.</p>

<div id="S2.SS2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Recently, knowledge distillation has received increasing attention in model compression, since it is capable of retaining compact model structure with promoted performance. Hinton et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite> first came up with the concept of knowledge distillation by introducing the soft label of the teacher network as part of the loss of the student network, allowing the student network to learn probability distribution fitting of the teacher model for classification task. Moreover, Romero et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite> demonstrated that semantic information in the intermediate layer can also be learned as dark knowledge by student networks. Thus, knowledge distillation can therefore be widely applied to a wide range of downstream tasks. Chen et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite> distilled the neck feature, classification head, and regression head by setting up three loss functions, respectively. Tang et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite> carefully designed the distillation weights and distillation loss functions such that they are automatically adjusted between samples for the single-stage object detector. Li et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite> used region proposals of the larger network to help the smaller network learn higher semantic information. Zheng et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite> transferred the knowledge distillation of the classification head to the location head of object detection, leading to a new distillation mechanism termed Localization Distillation (LD). LD makes logit mimicking become a better alternative to feature imitation, and reveals the knowledge of object category and object location should be handled separately. Dai et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite> developed GID framework which selects distillation areas based on differences between the student and teacher networks. Yang et al. proposed FGD <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite> which separates the foreground and background, enabling the student model to learn from the teacher network areas of interest and global knowledge via local and global distillation respectively. Besides, MGD <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite> imposes random masking on the feature map of the student model, and then generates the feature map reconstructing from the teacher network. However, the uncertainty of random masking may introduce additional noise, producing biased feature map with compromised representation capability.</p>

<p id="S3.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Recent research suggests learning and reconstructing the features of the teacher model is a desirable alternative to feature imitation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>. More specifically, expressive features can be generated from the masked regions on the feature map of the student network. However, previous state-of-the-art method mainly performs random feature masking without identifying the importance of different regions on the feature map. In this paper, we attempt to make the student model generate features corresponding to the important areas on the feature map of the teacher network. Towards this end, we propose a spatial-channel adaptive masked distillation strategy termed AMD. In contrast to the random masking strategy in the previous method, we perform feature masking via region-aware attention for identifying the important areas in the feature map of the teacher network. In order to improve the object-aware capability, we further introduce a simple and efficient SE module such that the resulting features are channel adaptive. The framework of our proposed method is illustrated in Fig. <a href="#S1.F2" title="Figure 2 ‣ I Introduction ‣ AMD: Adaptive Masked Distillation for Object Detection" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>.</p>

<p id="S3.SS1.p1.12" class="ltx_p">Using random pixels to recover the complete feature map, MGD allows the masked features of the student model to generate features of the teacher model. Thus, it is beneficial for the student network to obtain a better representation. However, the region-specific importance is discarded due to the random masking in MGD. To alleviate this drawback, we carefully design the region-aware feature masking with the help of spatial attention.
To begin with, we calculate the absolute mean value of the teacher network along the channel dimension:</p>

Except for the effective receptive field (ERF), the capability of capturing the object information in different scales can also bring a significant performance fluctuation for a detector, which is not considered in the previous work <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>.

We use 120k training images for training and 5k validation images for testing. For performance measures, we use Average Precision (AP) and Average Recall (AR) to evaluate the performance of different object detectors. Three mainstream detectors including the anchor-based one-stage detector RetinaNet <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>, the two-stage detector Faster-RCNN <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>, and the anchor-free detector RepPoint <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite> are involved in our comprehensive experiments.

In the other case, Ada-Channel is embedded within two consecutive convolution layers of the generation block, which implies that two modules are coupled.

<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we focus on the topic of feature-based masked distillation and propose spatial-channel adaptive masked distillation termed AMD for object detection. On the one hand, we perform spatially adaptive feature masking to encode the region-specific importance, such that more important and expressive features can be learned from the teacher network. On the other hand, to improve the object-awareness capability, we utilize the simple and efficient SE block to generate informative channel-adaptive clues for the student model. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority and effectiveness of our method, showing that the proposed AMD model not only significantly boosts the performance of the baseline student model but also outperforms the other state-of-the-art distillation approaches.</p>

<div id="S5.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In our proposed AMD, the spatial attention map generated from the feature of the teacher model lacks information interaction. Our future work will focus on exploring alternative strategies to enhance the interaction among different locations on the attention map.</p>
