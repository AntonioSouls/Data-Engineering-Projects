<p id="id13.id1" class="ltx_p">Dexterous manipulation of objects in virtual environments with our bare hands, by using only a depth sensor and a state-of-the-art 3D hand pose estimator (HPE), is challenging. While virtual environments are ruled by physics, e.g. object weights and surface frictions, the absence of force feedback makes the task challenging, as even slight inaccuracies on finger tips or contact points from HPE may make the interactions fail. Prior arts simply generate contact forces in the direction of the fingers’ closures, when finger joints penetrate virtual objects. Although useful for simple grasping scenarios, they cannot be applied to dexterous manipulations such as in-hand manipulation. Existing reinforcement learning (RL) and imitation learning (IL) approaches train agents that learn skills by using task-specific rewards, without considering any online user input. In this work, we propose to learn a model that maps noisy input hand poses to target virtual poses, which introduces the needed contacts to accomplish the tasks on a physics simulator. The agent is trained in a residual setting by using a model-free hybrid RL+IL approach. A 3D hand pose estimation reward is introduced leading to an improvement on HPE accuracy when the physics-guided corrected target poses are remapped to the input space. As the model corrects HPE errors by applying minor but crucial joint displacements for contacts, this helps to keep the generated motion visually close to the user input. Since HPE sequences performing successful virtual interactions do not exist, a data generation scheme to train and evaluate the system is proposed. We test our framework in two applications that use hand pose estimates for dexterous manipulations: hand-object interactions in VR and hand-object motion reconstruction in-the-wild. Experiments show that the proposed method outperforms various RL/IL baselines and the simple prior art of enforcing hand closure, both in task success and hand pose accuracy.</p>

<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Capturing and transferring human hand motion to anthropomorphic hand models in physics-embedded environments, is the cornerstone of applications that require realistic interactions in VR/AR.
To capture hand motion in such applications, most previous works resort to expensive and intrusive motion capture (mocap) systems, such as gloves <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>, exoskeletons and controllers <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>. In this work, we aim to avoid such systems and explore a solution that allows us to perform dexterous manipulation actions by only using an estimate of the human hand pose.</p>

Simple pose retargeting functions fail due to the domain gap, contact physics, pose prediction errors and noise. Our method observes both the imperfect mapped hand pose from the user input, middle row, and the state of the simulation and produces a small residual correction that completes the task. To train our system, we generate input hand poses, top row, with a new data generation scheme that builds upon a mocap dataset <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite> and a large public hand pose dataset <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>.

<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Hand pose estimators (HPEs) typically produce 3D locations of keypoints of a human hand model.
Given the difference between the human hand and the hand model, the design of a function mapping an input hand pose to the model’s parameters is needed, a process known as inverse kinematics or motion/pose retargeting.
Designing a function that produces a visually similar output is relatively straightforward, and hand-engineered <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>, data-driven <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite> or hybrid <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite> solutions are available.
However, when interacting with the simulated physical environment,
visual resemblance between input and target is not enough, given that one needs to consider both contact physics between the hand and object and input noise coming from the hand pose estimator as shown in Fig. <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ I INTRODUCTION ‣ Physics-Based Dexterous Manipulations with Estimated Hand Poses and Residual Reinforcement Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>.
Commercial solutions <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite> circumvent these problems simply by ignoring physics laws and ‘attracting’ the hand towards the object.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Other approaches model the underlying contact physics by establishing relationships between the virtual penetration of the hand on the object <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>.
Such solutions, despite being effective for some simple grasping actions, do not produce physically realistic motion in the target domain. Also, the inferred contact force will depend directly on the noisy pose estimate, making it difficult to apply the precise forces and subtle movements required in some dexterous tasks.</p>

<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">We propose a system, illustrated in Fig. <a href="#S2.F2" title="Figure 2 ‣ II RELATED WORK ‣ Physics-Based Dexterous Manipulations with Estimated Hand Poses and Residual Reinforcement Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>, that observes an imperfect user input and refines it in order to accomplish the manipulation task. We define the user input, Section <a href="#S3.SS1" title="III-A Inverse kinematics: from human hand pose to virtual pose ‣ III PROPOSED FRAMEWORK ‣ Physics-Based Dexterous Manipulations with Estimated Hand Poses and Residual Reinforcement Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag"><span class="ltx_text">III-A</span></span></a>, as an estimated hand pose mapped by an inverse kinematics or pose retargeting function. To achieve this, we introduce a residual agent that acts on top of the user input in Section <a href="#S3.SS2" title="III-B Residual Hand Agent ‣ III PROPOSED FRAMEWORK ‣ Physics-Based Dexterous Manipulations with Estimated Hand Poses and Residual Reinforcement Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag"><span class="ltx_text">III-B</span></span></a>. We assume that the user input is similar to the optimal action –modern HPEs present average joint errors in the range of 7 to 15 mm <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>– and only require a correcting stage to produce the correct kinematics. In order to automatically learn this correction without making any assumptions on the underlying contact physics, we train the residual agent using reinforcement learning (RL) in a model-free setting <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite> within an accurate physics simulator <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>. To avoid unnatural motion typically present under RL framework <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>, our system builds upon recent work in adversarial imitation learning (IL) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>, <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>, that uses a discriminator to encourage the policy to produce actions similar to trajectories from a dataset captured using a mocap glove <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>.
Unlike prior arts <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>, our method enables dexterous manipulations e.g. in-hand pen manipulation or picking a coin. The proposed residual agent is also learned by the 3D hand pose estimation reward, improving HPE accuracy when the physics-guided corrected target poses are re-mapped to input space. These objectives are presented in Section <a href="#S3.SS2.SSS1" title="III-B1 Reward function ‣ III-B Residual Hand Agent ‣ III PROPOSED FRAMEWORK ‣ Physics-Based Dexterous Manipulations with Estimated Hand Poses and Residual Reinforcement Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag"><span class="ltx_text">III-B</span>1</span></a>.</p>

<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">To train such a framework, we need continuous intended action sequences of noisy estimated hand poses, as well as some successful manipulation actions obtained by mocap data. It is difficult to collect such HPE sequences in an online fashion, because users tend to stop their motions in the middle of the tasks when they fail.
We first explore generating noisy input sequences by adding random noise to the ground-truth mocap data. To circumvent the gap between the synthetic noise and the real structured noise coming from HPE, we propose, in Section <a href="#S3.SS3" title="III-C Data generation scheme ‣ III PROPOSED FRAMEWORK ‣ Physics-Based Dexterous Manipulations with Estimated Hand Poses and Residual Reinforcement Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag"><span class="ltx_text">III-C</span></span></a>, a data generation approach which, given a dataset of successful manipulation sequences in the virtual space <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>, finds a ground-truth hand pose and depth image that is most likely to have generated such action, by querying a public large scale hand pose dataset <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>. Using this pipeline we conduct experiments on two potential applications of our framework. The first one, <span id="S1.p6.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Experiment A</span>, appears in Section <a href="#S4.SS1" title="IV-A Performing dexterous manipulations in a virtual space with estimated hand poses in mid-air ‣ IV EXPERIMENTS1footnote 11footnote 1Appendix can be found at the end of this document and videos in the project page: https://sites.google.com/view/dexres ‣ Physics-Based Dexterous Manipulations with Estimated Hand Poses and Residual Reinforcement Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag"><span class="ltx_text">IV-A</span></span></a> and it studies a typical VR scenario where the user interacts with the environment with their bare hands in mid-air and a hand pose estimator.

We share with <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite> the aim of achieving realistic interactions, but simply forcing contact is not enough for dexterous actions such as in-hand manipulation. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>]</cite> introduces a HPE tailored to a robot hand model. Given that our framework is HPE-agnostic, both works are complementary and could to produce a solid system if combined. In the VR and graphics community, perhaps the simplest approach for tackling such problems, and as adopted by commercial products such as Leap Motion <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite> or Hololens <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>, is to recognize the ongoing hand gesture, e.g. swipe or pinch, and then trigger a prerecorded output <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>, <a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">38</a>, <a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">39</a>]</cite>. However, such approaches produce artificial motion that often deviates significantly from the user input. Similarly, the interaction engine by Leap Motion <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite> recognizes the gesture and ‘attracts’ the object to the hand producing an artificial ‘sticking’ effect. Our method corrects the user input slightly, but only enough to achieve the task, and importantly it respects the laws of physics. Other works use a priori information about the hand and the scene, by synthesizing a grasp from a predefined database <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib40" title="" class="ltx_ref">40</a>, <a href="#bib.bib41" title="" class="ltx_ref">41</a>, <a href="#bib.bib42" title="" class="ltx_ref">42</a>, <a href="#bib.bib43" title="" class="ltx_ref">43</a>, <a href="#bib.bib44" title="" class="ltx_ref">44</a>]</cite>, limited to a specific set of objects and interactions, and very sensitive to uncertainty about the environment. Some works attempt to model the contact physics <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib45" title="" class="ltx_ref">45</a>, <a href="#bib.bib46" title="" class="ltx_ref">46</a>, <a href="#bib.bib47" title="" class="ltx_ref">47</a>, <a href="#bib.bib48" title="" class="ltx_ref">48</a>, <a href="#bib.bib49" title="" class="ltx_ref">49</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite> to infer contact forces between the hand and objects, by measuring, for example, the penetration of the user hand into the object mesh. The main problem of such approaches is that the computed contact force relies on high-precision hand pose estimation, and the method tends to apply forces that do not necessarily transfer to the real world without unexpected consequences.</p>

The main difference of our work is that we perform online predictions given a noisy user input instead of learning to mimic a skill in an offline fashion.
For this reason, we embrace the noisy nature of our problem and propose the residual learning guided by the hand pose estimation reward and the noisy data generation scheme.</p>

For attempting to learn robotic manipulation skills without user input, and using both RL and IL, we highlight three recent works <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>, <a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>. We share with <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite> a similar adversarial hybrid loss, however our model has significantly more degrees of freedom.We build upon <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>’s simulation framework, using their dataset of glove demonstrations, and extend the environments to deal with vision-based hand pose estimation. We share with <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite> the ambition of learning physically accurate dexterous hand manipulations, but more in physics embedded VR space using user’s hand via state-of-the-art hand pose estimator.</p>

We share with these works the residual nature of our policy and the idea that improving an action, instead of learning from scratch, significantly helps the exploration problem of RL and tends to produce more robust policies. The main difference from our work is that our residual action works on top of a user input instead of a pre-trained policy, i.e. our policy observes the action taken by the user and the world and then acts accordingly, instead of just observing the state of the world, which could lead to a discrepancy between the user’s intention and the agent. Other differences include the nature of the problem, the complexity of the action space, the combination with adversarial IL, and a problem setting similar to shared autonomy <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>.</p>

The discriminator indicates how much the actions resemble expert human actions from a mocap dataset <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>, whilst the simulator allows us to generate several samples of rich physics simulation and to measure the resemblance between input and virtual poses. To train our framework in the absence of ground-truth pairs hand poses and actions, we can generate estimated hand poses by finding images on a large hand pose dataset <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite> that are likely to have generated the actions from the mocap dataset. Once we find these samples, we pass them through a hand pose estimator and an inverse kinematics or pose retargeting function to generate user input.

Two results are reported: the task success on noisy sequences generated from demonstration sequences that are only seen during training, and the accuracy on an independent test set. Some of the baselines do not succeed on some environments, being consistent with the results reported by <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. Furthermore, when training our residual policy, it converges significantly faster than other baselines (see Fig. <a href="#S3.F3" title="Figure 3 ‣ III-C Data generation scheme ‣ III PROPOSED FRAMEWORK ‣ Physics-Based Dexterous Manipulations with Estimated Hand Poses and Residual Reinforcement Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a> (a)). For instance, our policy converges after 3.8M and 5.2M samples for door opening and in-hand manipulation, compared to 7.9M and 13.8M for RL baseline. In our RL framework for our approach and baselines, 5M samples with network updates are generated in about 12 hours on a single core machine with a GTX 1080Ti, while RL alone baselines require only. The reason for this faster convergence is the help in exploration that the user input brings to the learning process <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib62" title="" class="ltx_ref">62</a>]</cite>. For the last scenario, ‘object relocation’, none of our baselines nor our approach is able to correct the user input and degrade its performance. We hypothesize that the low result of PPO propagates to our algorithm and using other optimization could help to recover the user input <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>.</p>

<p id="S4.SS1.SSS1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">To conclude this experiment we perform an ablation study to evaluate the impact of each RL and IL components of our approach. Combining both leads to accomplishing the task while keeping a motion that resembles the human experts more closely (see Fig. <a href="#S3.F3" title="Figure 3 ‣ III-C Data generation scheme ‣ III PROPOSED FRAMEWORK ‣ Physics-Based Dexterous Manipulations with Estimated Hand Poses and Residual Reinforcement Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a> (b) and video). In terms of task success, RL alone achieves 75.9% while IL alone 36.5%.</p>

Using RL with user-augmented reward improves the IK baseline on ‘in-hand’, however it struggles when noise from hand pose estimator is added. ‘RL-no user’ performs well on ‘door-op’, however in this baseline the virtual hand does not follow the user input and acts independently, similarly to triggering a prerecorded sequence.

We observe that our approach is able to accomplish the task while keeping a hand posture similar to the visual input (qualitative results are shown in Fig. <a href="#S4.F5" title="Figure 5 ‣ IV-B Physics-based hand-object sequence reconstruction ‣ IV EXPERIMENTS1footnote 11footnote 1Appendix can be found at the end of this document and videos in the project page: https://sites.google.com/view/dexres ‣ Physics-Based Dexterous Manipulations with Estimated Hand Poses and Residual Reinforcement Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5</span></a>) and perform better than all baselines at train and test time. We observe that introducing the pose reward encourages a virtual pose closer to the visual input. Note that the virtual model is fixed in terms of bone lengths and kinematics and thus the reprojected pose will have an error offset even if the mapping was perfect. We show a successful example with generated contact forces in Fig. <a href="#S3.F3" title="Figure 3 ‣ III-C Data generation scheme ‣ III PROPOSED FRAMEWORK ‣ Physics-Based Dexterous Manipulations with Estimated Hand Poses and Residual Reinforcement Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a> (c)). We observe a significant gap between training and test results that is even more severe in the ‘give coin’ scenario where all the baselines show poor results in both training and test sets. Slight inaccuracies make the light and thin coin fall and thus failing in the task. We suspect that there are two main reasons for this. First, hand pose estimation errors are more severe than in the previous experiment and propagate through the hand model. Second the small number of training sequences may lead our network to overfit to the training set to some extent. This effect could be relieved by recording more training data or some data/trajectory augmentation technique. Note that the results on training sequences are still meaningful in the problem of offline motion reconstruction <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>.</p>

<div id="S5.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We presented a framework that can perform dexterous manipulation skills by simply using a hand pose estimator without the need of any costly hardware. A residual agent learns within a physics simulator how to improve the user input to achieve a task while keeping the motion close to the input and expert recorded trajectories. We showed that our approach can be applied on two applications that require accurate hand-object motion while using noisy input poses.</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p2.1" class="ltx_p">We believe this paper can inspire future work and it can be extended in several different ways. For instance, making the full framework end-to-end, where the gradients propagate from the simulator to the hand pose estimator, is a promising direction for physics-based pose estimation. For the second application, it would also be interesting to add a 6D object pose estimator in the loop <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib66" title="" class="ltx_ref">66</a>]</cite>. Besides, generating synthetic data to close the training loop has also potential, for instance by fitting a realistic hand model in a similar way as in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib67" title="" class="ltx_ref">67</a>]</cite> on top of mocap data or already trained policies <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. This could also help to narrow, to some extent, the training-test gap found in our experiments and make possible the deployment of the system to receive poses in a stream in a VR system and may prompt additional challenges. The study of RL generalization to both in-the-wild scenarios and other tasks is an open research problem. New results in these areas would benefit the present work, because how to scale up the number of tasks in the current framework is not clear.</p>

We then retrieve the associated depth image and compute the estimated hand pose. We do not consider the translation of the hand in the image given that this seriously limits the number of candidate poses, however we deal with this by generating different positions by adding noise on the ground-truth translations, which also allows us to generate diverse realistic sequences, thus making our training more diverse.

The user hand has to pick up the hammer from the ground, move it over to the nail and hammer in with a significant force to get the nail to move into the board. The nail has dry friction capable of absorbing up of 15N of force. There are more than one steps needed to perform this task, which require accurate grasping and positioning.

We use the inverse kinematics function from <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite> to do the first mapping between estimated hand poses and hand model. We control the 23 actuators of the hand model, while the global rotation and orientation of the model in the virtual space are predicted by the hand pose estimator. As action representation, PD controllers are used to compute joint torques with default gain parameters <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite>. In this experiment we found that using early termination (i.e. resetting the environment when the object falls far away) helped to make the training converge faster. 25% of the action space is used as residual domain.</p>

The box represents the other user’s hand and the task is to place the coin within the limits of the box. There are two big challenges in this task: holding the small coin and carefully placing it in the box. In the original dataset there are 25 sequences, however we had to discard five of them due to simulator instabilities.</p>

The first two lines of the equation represent the ‘approaching box’ phase where contact between index, thumb and coin are encouraged. The last two lines give a high reward when the coin is within the limits of the box and penalizes when the coin is far from the target (e.g. the coin fell outside the box).</p>
