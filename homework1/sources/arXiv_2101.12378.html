<p id="id2.id1" class="ltx_p">3D pose estimation is a challenging but important task in computer vision.
In this work, we show that standard deep learning approaches to 3D pose estimation are not robust when objects are partially occluded or viewed from a previously unseen pose.
Inspired by the robustness of generative vision models to partial occlusion, we propose to integrate deep neural networks with 3D generative representations of objects into a unified neural architecture that we term NeMo.
In particular, NeMo learns a generative model of neural feature activations at each vertex on a dense 3D mesh.
Using differentiable rendering we estimate the 3D object pose by minimizing the reconstruction error between NeMo and the feature representation of the target image.
To avoid local optima in the reconstruction loss, we train the feature extractor to maximize the distance between the individual feature representations on the mesh using contrastive learning.
Our extensive experiments on PASCAL3D+, occluded-PASCAL3D+ and ObjectNet3D show that NeMo is much more robust to partial occlusion and unseen pose compared to standard deep networks, while retaining competitive performance on regular data.
Interestingly, our experiments also show that NeMo performs reasonably well even when the mesh representation only crudely approximates the true object geometry with a cuboid, hence revealing that the detailed 3D geometry is not needed for accurate 3D pose estimation.

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Object pose estimation is a fundamentally important task in computer vision with a multitude of real-world applications, e.g. in self-driving cars, or partially autonomous surgical systems.
Advances in the architecture design of deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Tulsiani &amp; Malik (<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">2015</a>); Su et al. (<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">2015</a>); Mousavian et al. (<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">2017</a>); Zhou et al. (<a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">2018</a>)</cite>
increased the performance of computer vision systems at 3D pose estimation enormously.
However, our experiment shows current 3D pose estimation approaches are not robust to partial occlusion and when objects are viewed from a previously unseen pose.
This lack of robustness
can have serious consequences in real-world applications
and therefore needs to be addressed by the research community.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In general, recent works follow either of two approaches for object pose estimation:
Keypoint-based approaches detect a sparse set of keypoints and subsequently align a 3D object representation to the detection result.
However, due to the sparsity of the keypoints, these approaches are highly vulnerable when the keypoint detection result is affected by adverse viewing conditions, such as partial occlusion.
On the other hand, rendering-based approaches utilize a generative model, that is built on a dense 3D mesh representation of an object. They estimate the object pose by reconstructing the input image in a render-and-compare manner (Figure <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ NeMo: Neural Mesh Models of Contrastive Features for Robust 3D Pose Estimation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>).
While rendering-based approaches can be more robust to partial occlusion <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Egger et al. (<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">2018</a>)</cite>, their core limitation is that they model objects in terms of image intensities. Therefore, they pay too much attention to object details that are not relevant for the 3D pose estimation task. This makes them difficult to optimize <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Blanz &amp; Vetter (<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">2003</a>); Schönborn et al. (<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">2017</a>)</cite>, and also requires a detailed mesh representation for every shape variant of an object class (e.g. they need several types of sedan meshes instead of using one prototypical type of sedan).</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">In this work, we introduce NeMo a rendering-based approach to 3D pose estimation that is highly robust to partial occlusion, while also being able to generalize to previously unseen views. Our key idea is to learn a generative model of an object category in terms of neural feature activations, instead of image intensities (Figure <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ NeMo: Neural Mesh Models of Contrastive Features for Robust 3D Pose Estimation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>).
In particular, NeMo is composed of a prototypical mesh representation of the object category and feature representations at each vertex of the mesh.
The feature representations are learned to be invariant to instance specific details (such as shape and color variations) that are not relevant for the 3D pose estimation task.
Specifically, we use contrastive learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">He et al. (<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>); Wu et al. (<a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">2018</a>); Bai et al. (<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite> to ensure that the extracted features of an object are distinct from each other (e.g. the features of the front tire of a car are different from those of the back tire), while also being distinct from non-object features in the background.
Furthermore, we train a generative model of the feature activations at every vertex of the mesh representation.
During inference, NeMo estimates the object pose by reconstructing a target feature map with using render-and-compare and gradient-based optimization w.r.t. the 3D object pose parameters.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">We evaluate NeMo at 3D pose estimation on the PASCAL3D+ <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Xiang et al. (<a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">2014</a>)</cite> and the ObjectNet3D <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Xiang et al. (<a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">2016</a>)</cite> dataset. Both datasets contain a variety of rigid objects and their corresponding 3D CAD models.
Our experimental results show that NeMo outperforms popular approaches such as Starmap <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Zhou et al. (<a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">2018</a>)</cite> at 3D pose estimation by a wide margin under partial occlusion, and performs comparably when the objects are not occluded.
Moreover, NeMo is exceptionally robust when objects are seen from a viewpoint that is not present in the training data.
Interestingly, we also find that the mesh representation in NeMo can simply approximate the true object geometry with a cuboid, and still perform very well.

Category-Level object pose estimation has been well explored by the research community. A classical approach as proposes by <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Tulsiani &amp; Malik (<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">2015</a>)</cite> and <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Mousavian et al. (<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">2017</a>)</cite> was to formulate object pose estimation as a classification problem. Another common category-level object pose estimation approach involves a two-step process <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Szeto &amp; Corso (<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">2017</a>); Pavlakos et al. (<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">2017</a>)</cite>: First, semantic keypoints are detected interdependently and subsequently a Perspective-n-Point problem is solved to find the optimal 3D pose of an object mesh <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Lu et al. (<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">2000</a>); Lepetit et al. (<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">2009</a>)</cite>. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Zhou et al. (<a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">2018</a>)</cite> further improved this approach by utlizing depth information. Recent work <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Wang et al. (<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>); Chen et al. (<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite> introduced render-and-compare to for category-level pose estimation. However, both approaches used pixel-level image synthesis and required detailed mesh models during training.In contrast, NeMo preforms render-and-compare on the level of contrastive features, which are invariant to intra-category nuisances, such as shape and color variations. This enables NeMo to achieve accurate 3D pose estimation results even with a crude prototypical category-level mesh representation.</p>

Keypoint-based pose estimation methods are sensitive to outliers, which can be caused by partial occlusion <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Pavlakos et al. (<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">2017</a>); Sundermeyer et al. (<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">2018</a>)</cite>. Some rendering-based approaches achieve satisfactory results on instance-level pose estimation under partial occlusion <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Song et al. (<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>); Peng et al. (<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>); Zakharov et al. (<a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>); Li et al. (<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">2018</a>)</cite>. However, these approaches render RGB images or use instance-level constraints, e.g. pixel-level voting, to estimate object pose. Therefore, these approaches are not suited for category-level pose estimation. To the best of our knowledge, NeMo is the first approach that performs category-level pose estimation robustly under partial occlusion.</p>

<p id="S3.SS4.p2.1" class="ltx_p">A fundamental benefit of our Neural Mesh Models is that, they are generative on the level of neural feature activations. This makes the overall reconstruction loss very smooth compared to related works who are generative on the pixel level. Therefore, NeMo can be optimized w.r.t. the pose parameters with standard stochastic gradient descent. We visualize the loss as a function of the individual pose parameters in Figure <a href="#S3.F2" title="Figure 2 ‣ 3.3 Training using Maximum Likelihood and Contrastive Learning ‣ 3 NeMo: A 3D generative model of neural features ‣ NeMo: Neural Mesh Models of Contrastive Features for Robust 3D Pose Estimation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>. Note that the losses are generally very smooth and contain one clear global optimum. This is in stark contrast to the optimization of classic generative models at the level of RGB pixels, which often requires complex hand designed initialization and optimization procedures to avoid the many local optima of the reconstruction loss <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Blanz &amp; Vetter (<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">2003</a>); Schönborn et al.

For each example, we show four subfigures. Top-left: the input image; Top-right: A mesh superimposed on the input image in the predicted 3D pose. Bottom-left: The occluder localization result, where yellow is background, green is the non-occluded area of the object and red is the occluded area as predicted by NeMo.
Bottom-right: The loss landscape for each individual camera parameter respectively. The colored vertical lines demonstrate the final prediction and the ground-truth parameter is at center of x-axis.

For initialization of pose optimization, we uniformly sample 144 different poses (12 azimuth angles, 4 elevation angles, 3 in-plane rotations respectively). Then we pick the initial pose with minimum reconstruction loss as a starting point of optimization (optimization conduct with only the chosen pose, others will be deprecated). On average each image takes about 8s with a single GPU for inference. The whole inference process on PASCAL3D+ takes about 3 hours using a 8 GPU machine.</p>

<p id="S4.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S4.SS2.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">NeMo.</span> We evaluate NeMo in three different setups: NeMo uses a down-sampled object mesh as geometry representation, NeMo-MultiCuboid and NeMo-SingleCuboid approximate the 3D object geometry crudely using 3D cuboid boxes. We discuss the cuboid generation and results in detail in the next paragraph.
Compared to the baseline performances, we observe that NeMo achieves competitive performance at estimating the 3D pose of non-occluded objects. Moreover, <span id="S4.SS2.p2.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">NeMo is much more robust compared to all baseline approaches</span>. In particular, we observe that NeMo achieves the highest performance at every evaluation metric when the objects are partially occluded.
Note that the training data for all models is exactly the same.

<br class="ltx_break">To further investigate and understand the robustness of NeMo, we qualitatively analyze the pose estimation and occluder location predictions of NeMo in Figure <a href="#S4.F3" title="Figure 3 ‣ 4 Experiment ‣ NeMo: Neural Mesh Models of Contrastive Features for Robust 3D Pose Estimation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a>. Each subfigure shows the input image, the pose estimation result, the occluder localization map and the loss as a function of the pose angles.
We visualize the loss landscape along each pose parameter (azimuth, elevation and in-plane rotation) by sampling the individual parameters in a fixed step size, while keeping all other parameters at their ground-truth value.
We further split the binary occlusion map <math id="S4.SS2.p2.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\mathcal{Z}" display="inline"><semantics id="S4.SS2.p2.1.m1.1a"><mi class="ltx_font_mathcaligraphic" id="S4.SS2.p2.1.m1.1.1" xref="S4.SS2.p2.1.m1.1.1.cmml">𝒵</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S4.SS2.p2.1.m1.1b"><ci id="S4.SS2.p2.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS2.p2.1.m1.1.1">𝒵</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S4.SS2.p2.1.m1.1c">\mathcal{Z}</annotation></semantics></math> into three regions to highlight the occluder localization performance of NeMo. In particular, we split the region that is explained by the background model into a yellow and a red region. The red region is covered by rendered mesh and highlights the locations with the projected region of the mesh, which the neural mesh model cannot explain well. Hence these mark the locations in the image that NeMo predicts to be occluded. From the qualitative illustrations, we observe that NeMo maintains high robustness even under extreme occlusion, when only a small part of the object is visible. Furthermore, we can clearly see that NeMo can approximately localize the occluders. This occluder localization property of NeMo makes our model not just more robust but also much more human-interpretable compared to standard deep network approaches.</p>

<div id="S4.SS2.p3" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S4.SS2.p3.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S4.SS2.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">NeMo without detailed object mesh.</span> We approximate the object geometry in NeMo by replacing the downsampled mesh with 3D cuboid boxes (see Figure <a href="#A1.F5" title="Figure 5 ‣ Appendix A Appendix ‣ NeMo: Neural Mesh Models of Contrastive Features for Robust 3D Pose Estimation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5</span></a>). The vertices of the cuboid meshes are evenly distributed on all six sides of the cuboid.
For generating the cuboids, we use three constraint: 1) The cuboid should cover all the vertices of the original mesh with minimum volume; 2) The distances between each pair of adjacent vertices should be similar; 3) The total number of vertices for each mesh should be around 1200 vertices. We generate two different types of models. NeMo-MultiCuboid uses a separate cuboid for each object mesh in an object category, while NeMo-SingleCuboid uses on cuboid for all instances of a category.

<br class="ltx_break">We report the pose estimations results with NeMo using cuboid meshes in Table <a href="#S4.T1" title="Table 1 ‣ 4.1 Experimental Setup ‣ 4 Experiment ‣ NeMo: Neural Mesh Models of Contrastive Features for Robust 3D Pose Estimation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>. The results show that approximating the detailed mesh representations of a category with <span id="S4.SS2.p3.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">a single 3D cuboid gives surprisingly good results</span>. In particular, NeMo-SingleCuboid even often outperforms our standard model. This shows that generative models of neural network feature activations must not retain the detailed object geometry, because the feature activations are invariant to detailed shape properties. Moreover, NeMo-MultiCube outperforms the SingleCube model significantly. This suggests that for some categories the size between different sub-types can be very differnt (e.g. for the airplane class it could be a passanger jet or a fighter jet). Therefore, a single mesh may not be representative enough for some object categories. The MultiCuboid model even outperforms our the model with detailed mesh geometry. This is very likely caused by difficulties during the down-sampling of the original meshes in PASCAL3D+, which might remove important parts of the object geometry.
<br class="ltx_break">We also conduct experiment on ObjectNet3D dataset, which reported in Table <a href="#S4.T2" title="Table 2 ‣ 4.2 Robust 3D Pose Estimation Under Occlusion ‣ 4 Experiment ‣ NeMo: Neural Mesh Models of Contrastive Features for Robust 3D Pose Estimation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>. The result demonstrates that NeMo outperforms StarMap in 14 categories out of all 18 categories. Note that due to the considerable number of occluded and truncated images in ObjectNet3D dataset, this dataset is significantly harder than PASCAL3D+, however, NeMo still demonstrates reasonable accuracy.</p>

The histogram on the left shows how we separate the PASCAL3D+ test dataset into subsets based on the azimuth pose of the object. We have similarly split the training dataset and trained all models only on the ”seen” subset. We evaluate on both test sets (Seen &amp; Unseen). Note the strong generalization performance of NeMo in unseen view points.</figcaption><img src="/html/2101.12378/assets/Figures/ViewPointDistribution.png" id="S4.F4.1.g1" class="ltx_graphics ltx_img_square" width="110" height="110" alt="Refer to caption">

<p id="S4.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">To further investigate robustness of NeMo to out-of-distribution data, we evaluate the performance of NeMo when objects are observed from previously unseen viewpoints.
For this, we split the PASCAL3D+ dataset into two sets based on the ground-truth azimuth angle.
In particular, we use the front and rear views for training.
We evaluate all approaches on the full testing set and split the performance into seen (front and rear) and unseen (side) poses. The histogram on the left of Table <a href="#S4.F4" title="Figure 4 ‣ 4.3 Generalization to Unseen Views ‣ 4 Experiment ‣ NeMo: Neural Mesh Models of Contrastive Features for Robust 3D Pose Estimation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a> shows the distribution of ground-truth azimuth angles in the PASCAL3D+ test dataset. The seen-test-set contains 7305 images while the unseen-test-set contains 3507 images.
Table <a href="#S4.F4" title="Figure 4 ‣ 4.3 Generalization to Unseen Views ‣ 4 Experiment ‣ NeMo: Neural Mesh Models of Contrastive Features for Robust 3D Pose Estimation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a> shows that NeMo can significantly better generalize to novel viewpoints compared to the baselines. For some categories the accuracy of NeMo on the unseen-test-set is even comparable to seen-test-set (Table <a href="#A1.F7" title="Figure 7 ‣ Appendix A Appendix ‣ NeMo: Neural Mesh Models of Contrastive Features for Robust 3D Pose Estimation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">7</span></a>).
These results highlight the importance of building neural networks with 3D internal representations, which enable them to generalize exceptionally well to unseen 3D transformations.</p>

Specifically, we remove the clutter feature, background score and occluder prediction during inference, and only use foreground score to calculate pose loss. This reduces the robustness to occlusion significantly.
Furthermore, we remove the contrastive loss and use neural features that were extracted with an ImageNet-pretrained Resnet50 with non-parametric-upsampling. This leads to a massive decrease in performance, and hence highlights the importance of learning locally distinct feature representations.
Table <a href="#S4.T4" title="Table 4 ‣ 4.4 Ablation Study ‣ 4 Experiment ‣ NeMo: Neural Mesh Models of Contrastive Features for Robust 3D Pose Estimation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a> (and Table <a href="#A1.T9" title="Table 9 ‣ Appendix A Appendix ‣ NeMo: Neural Mesh Models of Contrastive Features for Robust 3D Pose Estimation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">9</span></a>) study the sensitivity of NeMo to the random pose initialization before the pose optimization.
In this ablation, we evaluate NeMo-MultiCuiboid with 144 down to 1 uniformly sampled initialization poses.
Note that we do not run 144 optimization processes.
We instead evaluate the reconstruction error for each initialization and start the optimization from the initializaiton with the lowest error.
Hence, every experiment only involves one optimization run.
The results demonstrate that NeMo benefits from the smooth lose landscape. With 6 initial samples NeMo achieves a reasonable performance, while 72 initial poses almost yield the maximum performance.
This ablation clearly highlights that, unlike standard Render-and-Compare approaches <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Blanz &amp; Vetter (<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">1999</a>); Schönborn et al.

<div id="S5.p1" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this work, we considered the problem of robust 3D pose estimation with neural networks. We found that <span id="S5.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">standard deep learning approaches do not give robust predictions</span> when objects are partially occluded or viewed from an unseen pose.
In an effort to resolve this fundamental limitation we developed Neural Mesh Models (NeMo), a neural network architecture that <span id="S5.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">integrates a prototypical mesh representation with a generative model of neural features</span>. We combine NeMo with contrastive learning and show that this makes possible to <span id="S5.p1.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">estimate the 3D pose with very high robustness to out-of-distribution data</span> using simple gradient-based render-and-compare. Our experiments demonstrate the superiority of NeMo compared to related work on a range of challenging datasets.</p>

<figcaption class="ltx_caption"><span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_figure">Figure 6: </span>Visualization of failure case of NeMo on occluded PASCAL3D+. For each example, we show four subfigures. Top-left: the input image; Top-right: A mesh superimposed on the input image in the predicted 3D pose. Bottom-left: The occluder localization result, where yellow is background, green is the non-occluded area of the object and red is the occluded area as predicted by NeMo.
Bottom-right: The loss landscape for each individual camera parameter respectively. The colored vertical lines demonstrate the final prediction and the ground-truth parameter is at center of x-axis.
