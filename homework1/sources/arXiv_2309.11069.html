<p id="id11.id1" class="ltx_p">We introduce Dynamic Tiling, a model-agnostic, adaptive, and scalable approach for small object detection, anchored in our inference-data-centric philosophy. Dynamic Tiling starts with non-overlapping tiles for initial detections and utilizes dynamic overlapping rates along with a tile minimizer. This dual approach effectively resolves fragmented objects, improves detection accuracy, and minimizes computational overhead by reducing the number of forward passes through the object detection model. Adaptable to a variety of operational environments, our method negates the need for laborious recalibration. Additionally, our large-small filtering mechanism boosts the detection quality across a range of object sizes. Overall, Dynamic Tiling outperforms existing model-agnostic uniform cropping methods, setting new benchmarks for efficiency and accuracy.</p>

<span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_section">1 </span>Introduction</h2>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Off-the-shelf deep learning-based object detection models often struggle to detect extremely small objects that are significantly smaller than the overall image size. To tackle this problem, previous studies have proposed various solutions such as modifying network architectures with scale-aware or attention mechanisms, artificially increasing image resolution using super-resolution techniques, or performing density cropping using additional annotations or auxiliary learning architectures <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#biba.bibx4" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>. However, these methods can be resource-intensive, time-consuming, and practically complex; which may hamper the broader adoption of this technology.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">We argue that small object detection, particularly the handling of prediction data during inference, embodies a unique inference-data-centric challenge. This perspective diverges from the more generalized view of data-centric AI, which predominantly emphasizes refining and curating training datasets while maintaining a consistent approach in model architectures, hyperparameters, and training pipelines. However, we posit that a holistic data-centric approach should encompass the entire lifecycle of a model. Beyond just training, passive or imprecise handling of data during both development and, crucially, during the inference stage can introduce systematic data errors or inefficiencies. Simply put, an overemphasis on training data quality, without a corresponding focus on data handling during model development and inference, may undermine the effectiveness of the entire system. Consequently, a comprehensive approach that prioritizes accurate data representation throughout both development and inference is essential to realize truly impactful object detection models.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Tiling, or uniform cropping, emerges as a promising inference-data-centric approach for small object detection. During inference, this technique uniformly breaks down images into smaller patches, each subjected to independent object detection. These separate detections are later combined using Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS) to present a holistic detection collection of the entire image. Fixed overlaps are commonly utilized during tiling to ensure that objects on the borderlines of these patches are effectively captured by adjacent tiles. Full image inference can also be employed with the smaller patches using NMS to detect larger objects. Tiling increases the relative pixel coverage of smaller objects compared to simply using the original image as input to the model. It allows models to fully harness the source image’s resolution, despite the constraints of limited GPU memory. Although this strategy has been critiqued for inefficiency due to performing detection on overlapping and empty patches, it is more straightforward compared to many alternatives and has seen widespread adoption because it can be used only in the inference phase. The only adjustment made during training to accommodate tiling better is in the data augmentation process. Consequently, object detectors that utilize tiling can demonstrate excellent performance in the immediate detection of small objects with minimal modifications.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">While current methodologies lay a foundational approach, there exists an avenue for optimization to heighten their practicality. The limitations of a one-size-fits-all strategy become evident when uniformly applying an overlapping rate across all patches, as it inadequately caters to the diverse characteristics of objects of different sizes and different environments. Additionally, relying solely on NMS for blindly merging detections from different tiles often falls short, especially when faced with edge cases of irregularly shaped objects. Challenges are further compounded when large objects span multiple patches, resulting in fragmentation and subsequent detection inaccuracies. This becomes especially problematic for classes with closely resembling features, such as cars and trucks. The existing non-class-agnostic NMS, even when applied to both patches and full image predictions, struggles to address this.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">In response to these challenges, we introduce Dynamic Tiling, a flexible and adaptive tiling solution specifically tailored for small object detection during inference. Our method is built on the notion of dynamic overlapping rates, which are informed by initial detections from non-overlapping patches. This unique approach not only rectifies fragmented objects but also optimizes computational efficiency by selectively applying overlapping only when necessary.</p>

<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S2.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold ltx_font_italic">Learning-based object detection:</span>
In recent years, learning-based object detection techniques have gained widespread use across various applications. These techniques can be broadly classified into two primary categories: two-stage detectors and single-stage detectors. Two-stage detectors, such as Fast R-CNN <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#biba.bibx7" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>, Faster R-CNN <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#biba.bibx12" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite>, and Cascade R-CNN <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#biba.bibx2" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>, involve an initial proposal stage that is subsequently refined. This process makes them slower but often yields more accurate results. In contrast, single-stage detectors, such as SSD <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#biba.bibx11" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite>, YOLO <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#biba.bibx8" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>, and RetinaNet <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#biba.bibx9" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>, bypass the proposal stage to directly predict object locations, resulting in faster, albeit less accurate, detection.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Recently, anchor-free detectors like FCOS <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#biba.bibx13" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite>, VFNet <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#biba.bibx15" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite>, TOOD <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#biba.bibx6" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>, and the more recent Yolov8 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#biba.bibx8" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite> have begun to garner attention. These models remove the need for predefined anchor boxes and strive to strike a balance between detection speed and accuracy. We undertake an empirical study using the anchor-free one-stage YOLOv8m detectors.</p>

<div id="S2.p3" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S2.p3.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S2.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold ltx_font_italic">Tiling-based solutions to small object detection:</span> To address the challenge of small object detection, some prior studies have manipulated data during inference by dividing images into smaller patches, a process known as tiling.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p4.1" class="ltx_p">For instance, DarkHelp for YOLOv4 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#biba.bibx3" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite> allows users to define a fixed tiling dimension (e.g., 3x2, 5x3). If detected objects are located near the "dividing line" (the boundary between two tiles) and the bounding boxes are approximately of similar size, these are likely parts of the same object split across two tiles. Consequently, they are "merged" into a single entity. However, this method can lead to incorrect detections at the boundaries. For example, two separate objects located adjacently and sharing similar sizes could be incorrectly merged. Similarly, if a single irregular object is divided into large and small boxes, these might not be recognized as belonging to the same entity.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p5.1" class="ltx_p">The predefined dimension with overlapping tiling method <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#biba.bibx14" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite> requires users to define a fixed tiling dimension and an overlap threshold (e.g., 25%, 50%). However, using a fixed overlap with a specific number of tiles necessitates an increase in tile size, which could potentially decrease pixel coverage for small objects.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p6.1" class="ltx_p">SAHI <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#biba.bibx1" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>, a seminal paper in the tiling approach, employs a user-specified patch size (e.g., <math id="S2.p6.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="640\times 640" display="inline"><semantics id="S2.p6.1.m1.1a"><mrow id="S2.p6.1.m1.1.1" xref="S2.p6.1.m1.1.1.cmml"><mn id="S2.p6.1.m1.1.1.2" xref="S2.p6.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml">640</mn><mo lspace="0.222em" rspace="0.222em" id="S2.p6.1.m1.1.1.1" xref="S2.p6.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml">×</mo><mn id="S2.p6.1.m1.1.1.3" xref="S2.p6.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml">640</mn></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S2.p6.1.m1.1b"><apply id="S2.p6.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S2.p6.1.m1.1.1"><times id="S2.p6.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S2.p6.1.m1.1.1.1"></times><cn type="integer" id="S2.p6.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S2.p6.1.m1.1.1.2">640</cn><cn type="integer" id="S2.p6.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S2.p6.1.m1.1.1.3">640</cn></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S2.p6.1.m1.1c">640\times 640</annotation></semantics></math>) and an overlap threshold that is applied across the entire image. One challenge with this approach is the potential need for adjustments or the addition of extra patches to cover areas that remain when the image dimensions and stride do not align perfectly. Moreover, although SAHI can be applied solely during inference, the original paper utilizes up-scaling for both training and inference. This design choice may not fully reveal the actual performance capabilities of SAHI. In contrast, our method maintains the resolution at the tile size for both training and inference, enabling us to isolate the effects of our Dynamic Tiling approach. Remarkably, even under these constraints, our Dynamic Tiling approach still achieves performance metrics that surpass those reported for SAHI in their original publication.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p7" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p7.1" class="ltx_p">Moreover, adapting current tiling methods like DarkHelp, the predefined dimension with overlapping tiling, or SAHI to new environments presents yet another challenge: the necessity for recalibration of overlap thresholds. These existing methods rely on user-specified or predetermined tiling dimensions and overlap percentages, which may not translate well when applied to different data distributions or object scales. The need to fine-tune these parameters for each new setting significantly hampers the scalability and generalizability of such approaches. For instance, what works for urban scenes with large, well-defined objects may fall short when applied to natural environments where objects can be smaller and more irregularly shaped. In contrast, our Dynamic Tiling approach is designed to adapt seamlessly across various conditions, reducing the need for laborious and time-consuming recalibration, and thereby offering a more robust and versatile solution.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p8" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p8.1" class="ltx_p">Building on these points, our Dynamic Tiling pipeline, rooted in our inference-data-centric philosophy, serves as a paradigm shift in object detection methodologies. Unlike traditional methods that lock users into labor-intensive recalibration cycles when adapting to new settings, our system’s adaptive nature streamlines this process. By performing inference on non-overlapping tiles and generating and merging dynamic patches only when necessary, we not only minimize computational overhead, heighten detection accuracy, but also ensure accurate object detection across a myriad of operational environments. This ability to self-adjust according to the data at hand also makes our approach uniquely scalable and generalizable, setting a new standard in the field of small object detection. Additionally, the incorporation of an object size filter enhances the quality of object detection for both small and large objects, offering a comprehensive solution that meets a broad range of detection needs.</p>

The maximum number of detections allowed per image is 1000. We measure the efficiency of our approach by determining the average time it takes to predict one image. To provide a clearer understanding of these metrics, we present the details used for their calculations.</p>

<p id="S4.SS3.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Our approach, exemplified by our best configuration "YOLOv8m + Dynamic Tiling (Ours) + FI + Tile Minimizer + TTA," has set new standards in the domain of model-agnostic small object detection, as evidenced by its outstanding performance across various evaluation metrics. Specifically, our best configuration achieves a mAP@0.5 score of 45.5 and a mAP@0.5:0.95 score of 27. The inclusion of Full-Image Inference (FI) allows our model to take into account global contextual information when detecting objects, thereby improving accuracy. Its incorporation into our best configuration contributes significantly to the elevated mAP scores, especially when detecting both large and small objects in complex scenes. When compared to "YOLOv8m + SAHI + FI + TTA," which had a mAP@0.5 of 41.6 and a mAP@0.5:0.95 of 24.7, our best configuration shows a relative improvement of 9.4% and 9.3% in these metrics, respectively. This level of performance suggests that our approach, instantiated by Dynamic Tiling, offers a superior balance of precision and recall across a range of object sizes and IoU thresholds. Furthermore, the significant gains in our best configuration can be primarily attributed to its proficiency in detecting small objects, where it achieves a mAP@0.5s of 31.2. In comparison to other methods such as "YOLOv8m + SAHI + FI + TTA," "YOLOv8m + PowerTiling + FI + TTA," and "YOLOv8m + Darkhelp + TTA," our best configuration shows a relative improvement in mAP@0.5s of 16.4%, 25.3%, and 13.5%, respectively.</p>

<div id="S4.SS3.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS3.p4.1" class="ltx_p">It’s important to note that there appears to be a trade-off between inference time and performance in our best configuration. While TTA enhances the mAP@0.5 score from 43.8 to 45.6, it more than doubles the average inference time from 0.160 to 0.333 seconds. However, Tile Minimizer, a feature in our best configuration, allows us to maintain high accuracy—comparable to configurations without Tile Minimizer—while notably reducing inference times. Specifically, the average inference time is brought down to 0.148 seconds, representing an improvement of 7.5% over the 0.160-second TTA-exclusive configuration, and to 0.301 seconds, representing an improvement of 9.6% over the 0.333-second TTA-inclusive configuration. Moreover, when compared to other previous methods, our best configuration consistently outperforms them in terms of inference time. Together with its outperformance in mAP metrics, this offers a more balanced solution for practical applications. Therefore, both our approach and our best configuration distinguish themselves by achieving remarkable accuracy while maintaining computational efficiency.</p>

<div id="S5.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Existing tiling methods confront critical limitations such as difficulties in detecting objects of varying sizes and extended inference times. To address these challenges, we introduce Dynamic Tiling. This innovative method, rooted in our inference-data-centric paradigm, diverges from traditional techniques that mainly focus on neural network architectures and optimization strategies.</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Our premier configuration, "YOLOv8m + Dynamic Tiling (Ours) + FI + Tile Minimizer + TTA," sets new benchmarks across multiple evaluation metrics, including mAP@0.5, mAP@0.5:0.95, and particularly mAP@0.5s for small object detection. Notably, our approach significantly increases detection accuracy through the use of dynamic overlapping rates, which enable the effective rectification of fragmented objects. In addition to improved accuracy, Dynamic Tiling reduces inference time by minimizing the number of forward passes needed through the object detection model and avoiding unnecessary overlapping in patches. This reduction in computational overhead strikes a unique balance between efficiency and performance, making our approach particularly suited for real-time applications.</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p3.1" class="ltx_p">What sets our method apart is its unparalleled adaptability. Dynamic Tiling eliminates the need for laborious recalibration, offering seamless integration into existing pipelines across a wide range of operational environments. This exceptional adaptability is further augmented by a large-small filtering mechanism that effectively consolidates detections from both patches and full images, enhancing the detection quality for objects of all sizes.</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Given these advantages, Dynamic Tiling does not merely find immediate applicability but also serves as a catalyst for revolutionary advancements in the fields of real-time small object detection and spatial computing, both of which require a delicate balance of computational power and accuracy. Through our focus on inference-data-centricity, we anticipate that Dynamic Tiling will establish a new paradigm, acting as a cornerstone for future innovations and setting unprecedented standards in object detection.</p>
