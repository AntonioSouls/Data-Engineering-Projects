<p id="id12.id1" class="ltx_p">LiDAR-based 3D object detection and panoptic segmentation are two crucial tasks in the perception systems of autonomous vehicles and robots. In this paper, we propose All-in-One Perception Network (AOP-Net), a LiDAR-based multi-task framework that combines 3D object detection and panoptic segmentation. In this method, a dual-task 3D backbone is developed to extract both panoptic- and detection-level features from the input LiDAR point cloud. Also, a new 2D backbone that intertwines Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) and convolution layers is designed to further improve the detection task performance. Finally, a novel module is proposed to guide the detection head by recovering useful features discarded during down-sampling operations in the 3D backbone. This module leverages estimated instance segmentation masks to recover detailed information from each candidate object. The AOP-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance for published works on the nuScenes benchmark for both 3D object detection and panoptic segmentation tasks. Also, experiments show that our method easily adapts to and significantly improves the performance of any BEV-based 3D object detection method.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Understanding the surrounding 3D environment is an essential component in autonomous driving and robotics to ensure safety and reliability. LiDAR-based 3D object detection and panoptic segmentation are two common tasks performed by the perception systems. For 3D object detection, foreground objects such as cars, pedestrians, etc., are classified and localized by 3D bounding boxes.
For 3D panoptic segmentation, each point in the scene is categorized with a semantic label and points for the same foreground object are assigned a unique instance ID.
For efficiency, most detection methods <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite> attempt to extract features from a summarized representation of the scene. Some quantize LiDAR points into volumetric grids, known as voxels, and then process the voxels with a 3D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Others project the point cloud or 3D voxels into 2D grids in Bird’s-Eye-View (BEV) or Range-View (RV) and process the grids by a 2D CNN. Furthermore, the CNNs deployed
typically perform
down-sampling steps to enlarge the receptive fields of convolution kernels and extract features efficiently. However, while quantization, projection, and down-sampling reduce computational cost, they result in considerable information loss about the scene.
</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Likewise, LiDAR-based 3D panoptic segmentation methods <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite> follow similar point cloud data representation strategies. While recent 3D object detection methods mostly operate in the scale-invariant BEV plane
<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>, many 3D panoptic segmentation methods rely on the denser and more detailed object representations in RV
<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>. Considering the strengths of each projection view and complementary goals of each perception task, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite> demonstrates that information extracted by the backbone of RV-based panoptic segmentation model can also be helpful for object detection. This approach presents a question: can object detection and panoptic segmentation networks be more integrated, so that both tasks benefit from one another?</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">To this end, we propose the All-in-One Perception Network (AOP-Net) for LiDAR-based joint 3D object detection and panoptic segmentation. In this multi-task framework, 3D object detection and panoptic segmentation are jointly trained and take advantage of one another for performance gains. More specifically, a dual-task 3D backbone is developed to extract both detection- and panoptic-level features from the voxelized 3D space. A new 2D backbone for 3D object detection is proposed that extensively fuses Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) layers into CNN, enabling a larger receptive field and deeper pixel-wise feature extraction while exhibiting a similar model complexity compared to traditional 2D backbones used for detection <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>. Finally, to recover lost useful features due to down-sampling, a novel Instance-based Feature Retrieval (IFR) module is proposed, which leverages the instance-level estimation from panoptic segmentation to recover object-specific features and highlight corresponding locations to guide object detection.
Our contributions can be summarized into four-fold: 1) A multi-task framework is proposed for joint LiDAR-based 3D object detection and panoptic segmentation. In this method, both tasks achieve performance gains as they mutually benefit from one another.
2) A deep and efficient 2D backbone that mixes MLPs and convolution layers for 3D object detection.
3) The IFR module that augments the detection head and recovers useful discarded multi-scale features based on panoptic segmentation estimations.
4) Through experiments, we show that each new component provides effective performance gain, and that the proposed framework easily adapts to and improves the performance of any BEV-based 3D object detection method.

This lightweight operation effectively augments the panoptic head with detection-level features.

However, in contrast to former methods,
detailed object information embedded in two sets of higher resolution voxel features will be recovered later in the IFR module. Moreover, three sets of higher resolution voxel features are projected to RV, fused with features extracted directly from the RV-projected point cloud via corresponding CBAMs, and processed by CPSeg’s RV encoding blocks. These multi-scale voxel-based features augment the RV-based panoptic head.
Meanwhile, this augmentation also enforces the 3D backbone to develop a richer set of semantic- and instance-level features.

<p id="S3.SS3.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Inspired by the ConvMLP <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite> used in image domains, we propose a simplified version of this architecture to process the BEV-projected features from the 3D backbone before feeding them to the detection head. The simplified ConvMLP (SC) block and the overall proposed 2D backbone architecture are shown in Figure <a href="#S3.F3" title="Figure 3 ‣ III-C Simplified ConvMLP (SC) Backbone ‣ III Method ‣ AOP-Net: All-in-One Perception Network for Joint LiDAR-based 3D Object Detection and Panoptic Segmentation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a>. Compared to the original ConvMLP block, we remove the last MLP layer and add a skip connection over the convolution layer to further ease the gradient flow.
In this architecture, the MLP block enables the interaction of features
in each spatial location, while the subsequent depth-wise convolution
enables efficient space-wise interaction.
In the backbone,
consecutive Conv blocks (each consists of a convolution layer followed by batch-normalization and ReLU) are first applied to enhance features interactions spatial-wise. Then, resulting features are sent through the first set of SC blocks,
down-sampled, and fed to another set of SC blocks. The outputs of these two sets of SC blocks are then matched and concatenated as the final set of the 2D features, which is sent to the detection head.

<p id="S3.SS3.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Compared to the regular 2D backbone in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>, the proposed 2D backbone boosts the detection performance without a steep increase in the model complexity. More specifically, compared to a regular 3x3 convolution layer, an SC block requires 54.6% less memory and 54.8% fewer FLOPs. Thus, by replacing regular convolutions with the lighter SC block, we afford to build more consecutive convolutions in a single resolution, achieving a larger receptive field without the need for further down-sampling. In addition, unlike other CNNs that employ a single 1x1 convolution layer for channel depth adjustment, this architecture employs MLP blocks extensively to emphasize on feature extraction within each BEV plane location.</p>

This enables the lower resolution averaged-voxels of an instance to leverage the higher resolution encoded features of the same instance. Finally, the resulting encoded feature vectors of each instance in different resolutions are concatenated and distributed to all the BEV locations that correspond to the instance according to the coarse-scale instance masks. This new set of feature maps is then concatenated to the output features from the 2D backbone and fed to the detection head. By doing so, we effectively augment the detection head by recovering and processing multi-scale information that is unique for each instance and commonly lost prior to the 2D backbone.</p>

is a large-scale dataset for autonomous driving that includes both 3D object detection and panoptic segmentation labels.
For 3D object detection, mean Average Precision (mAP) is a metric that is used for evaluation on this benchmark. Moreover,
nuScenes Detection Score (NDS) is another metric used, which is a weighted sum of mAP and box estimation quality metrics that account for translation, scale, orientation, attributes, and velocity. For 3D panoptic segmentation, we use the mean Panoptic Quality (PQ), which considers both mean Recognition Quality (RQ) and mean Segmentation Quality (SQ), to evaluate the performance.

The AOP-Net is based on the CenterPoint first stage. As shown, the proposed method outperforms the CenterPoint in both mAP and NDS scores for nuScenes significantly, and mAP and mAPH for Waymo considerably. As elaborated in ablations, improvements in the detection of large and small objects can be attributed to the SC Backbone and the IFR module, respectively.</p>

It can be seen that the proposed method outperforms all other methods in terms of NDS and all five error metrics that represent the box estimation quality, including the mean average errors in translation (mATE), scale (mASE), orientation (mAOE), velocity (mAVE), and attribute (mAAE). This improvement can be attributed to the guidance received from the panoptic segmentation module,
both direct (exploitation of panoptic segmentation predictions in IFR) and indirect (back propagation of panoptic loss in backbones).</p>

In example (a), the standalone CPSeg struggles to predict the semantics of distant points, leading to three false positives and one false negative. In (b), CPSeg under-segments on the left and over-segments near the top as it is less confident about regions that are less visible behind a large body of points.
In both cases, the dual-task 3D backbone in the AOP-Net provides effective multi-scale 3D features to prevent these errors.</p>

<p id="S4.SS4.SSS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Specifically, in Table <a href="#S4.T6" title="TABLE VI ‣ IV-C2 3D Panoptic Segmentation ‣ IV-C Results ‣ IV Experiments ‣ AOP-Net: All-in-One Perception Network for Joint LiDAR-based 3D Object Detection and Panoptic Segmentation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">VI</span></a>, it can be seen that incorporating the dual-task 3D backbone significantly boosts performances for both tasks. In particular, the improvement of AOP-Net in panoptic segmentation is mainly attributed to this module. As the 3D backbone is conditioned on both tasks, the learned features are enriched and provide additional clues regarding foreground objects. Moreover, the 3D backbone captures features without the occlusion or scale-variant issues common for feature extraction in RV plane. When projected to RV and fused with already extracted RV-based features, these set of features are more reliable and helpful in segmenting occluded and distant objects. These factors lead to a significant improvement in both mIOU and PQ.</p>

This is because IFR influences the detection head to pay more attention to
multi-scale features that are relevant to foreground objects. By reintroducing this information that is otherwise lost in the down-sampling process in the 3D backbone, the detection head improves both precision (by refining possible candidates) and recall (retrieving missed objects that are better detected in RV panoptic segmentation).</p>

<p id="S4.SS4.SSS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">To show that AOP-Net can also work with anchor-based detection methods,
we performed experiments by adapting the AOP-Net to PointPillars <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite> and SECOND <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>. The results of these experiments are shown in Table <a href="#S4.T10" title="TABLE X ‣ IV-C2 3D Panoptic Segmentation ‣ IV-C Results ‣ IV Experiments ‣ AOP-Net: All-in-One Perception Network for Joint LiDAR-based 3D Object Detection and Panoptic Segmentation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">X</span></a>. Also, we increased the model complexity of the PointPillars and SECOND and named them as Complex PointPillars and Complex SECOND. It can be seen that by simply increasing the model complexity, the performance boost is either nonexistent or limited. However, under the proposed framework, the mAP and NDS are improved remarkably.
The effects of the proposed framework are prevalent in Figure <a href="#S4.F6" title="Figure 6 ‣ IV-C2 3D Panoptic Segmentation ‣ IV-C Results ‣ IV Experiments ‣ AOP-Net: All-in-One Perception Network for Joint LiDAR-based 3D Object Detection and Panoptic Segmentation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">6</span></a>. It can be seen that in both examples (a) and (b), due to the loss of fine-scale features during down-sampling, PointPillars fails to detect small objects. On the other hand, in the proposed method, these objects are recognized by the RV-based segmentation module and their fine-scale features are recovered by the IFR module, allowing for their detection. Moreover, in example (b), PointPillars produces two false positives from afar, while the AOP-Net is properly guided by panoptic-level information and circumvents these mistakes.</p>

<div id="S5.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We propose AOP-Net, an all-in-one perception framework for LiDAR-based joint 3D object detection and panoptic segmentation. In this framework,
we design the dual-task 3D backbone to consider both semantic- and instance-level information of the scene, thereby augmenting both the BEV-based detection head and RV-based panoptic head.
Also, the multi-scale 3D voxel features resulted from this backbone are used to augment the single-scale RV feature maps in the panoptic segmentation task. Moreover, a deep and efficient 2D backbone based on the simplified ConvMLP (SC) block is proposed, which results in detection improvement. Finally, to recover features lost during down-sampling operations in the dual-task 3D backbone, a novel instance-based feature retrieval (IFR) module is proposed that relies on predicted instance masks and recovers features to augment the detection backbone. Experimental results on nuScenes and Waymo datasets show strong improvements in both 3D panoptic segmentation and object detection tasks under the proposed framework, while demonstrating that the detection accuracy of any BEV-based 3D object detection can be improved using the proposed strategy.</p>
