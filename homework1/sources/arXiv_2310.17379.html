<p id="id2.id1" class="ltx_p">Vehicle perception systems strive to achieve comprehensive and rapid visual interpretation of their surroundings for improved safety and navigation. We introduce YOLO-BEV, an efficient framework that harnesses a unique surrounding cameras setup to generate a 2D bird’s-eye view of the vehicular environment. By strategically positioning eight cameras, each at a 45-degree interval, our system captures and integrates imagery into a coherent 3x3 grid format, leaving the center blank, providing an enriched spatial representation that facilitates efficient processing. In our approach, we employ YOLO’s detection mechanism, favoring its inherent advantages of swift response and compact model structure. Instead of leveraging the conventional YOLO detection head, we augment it with a custom-designed detection head, translating the panoramically captured data into a unified bird’s-eye view map of ego car. Preliminary results validate the feasibility of YOLO-BEV in real-time vehicular perception tasks. With its streamlined architecture and potential for rapid deployment due to minimized parameters, YOLO-BEV poses as a promising tool that may reshape future perspectives in autonomous driving systems.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Autonomous driving systems represent a transformative shift in transportation, mobility, and road safety. The primary challenge for these systems lies in their ability to perceive and understand the environment effectively. Presently, mainstream research in the industry focuses on two main types of perception technologies: sensor-fusion solutions that integrate both LiDAR and radar with cameras <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>, and vision-only systems that rely solely on cameras <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>. While the fusion of sensor and vision-based technologies can offer robust perception, the approach often comes with increased cost and potential environmental challenges, making it less feasible for large-scale deployments.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In contrast, vision-based systems, which rely solely on camera setups for environmental perception, are emerging as not only a cost-effective alternative but also a method that aligns more closely with sustainable development goals. Consequently, vision-based solutions are increasingly being considered as a possible ultimate direction for the entire autonomous driving sector. One burgeoning research focus within this vision-based paradigm centers on generating a bird’s-eye view (BEV) of the surrounding environment as a means of enhancing vehicular perception. Traditional methods of generating such a view often suffer from limited scope due to constrained camera angles, thereby inhibiting the vehicle’s spatial awareness capabilities essential for real-time decision-making.</p>

<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Our work aims to break free from this limitation by pioneering an approach that establishes a direct spatial correspondence between the vehicle’s various camera locations and the BEV map. Specifically, the position of each image in the BEV map is determined by the vantage point from which it was captured; for example, an image taken from the front of the vehicle is mapped to the top part of the BEV, while an image from the rear finds its place at the bottom. In this way, we ensure a coherent and intuitive spatial representation of the environment around the vehicle.</p>

</h3>

<div id="S2.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In the realm of image-based object detection, techniques generally fall into either of two categories: two-stage and one-stage detectors. Faster R-CNN <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite> and Mask R-CNN <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite> are the notable examples of a two-stage detector, characterized by high levels of object recognition and localization accuracy. On the other hand, one-stage detectors like YOLO <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite> and SSD <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite> are known for their rapid inference capabilities. Given the specific requirements of autonomous driving and generating bird’s-eye views, the selection of the object detection algorithm is crucial. Although two-stage detectors, like Faster R-CNN, offer high accuracy, they may not be ideal for real-time applications due to computational complexities. On the contrary, one-stage detectors like YOLO offer a balanced compromise between speed and accuracy, crucial for real-time processing in autonomous driving where latency is a critical factor. Moreover, YOLO serves not just as a model backbone but as a foundational theory for our work. Many of our techniques and methods are derived or adapted from YOLO’s principles. Thus, we base our approach on YOLO for its real-time capabilities and theoretical robustness in the context of bird’s-eye view generation.</p>

<div id="S2.SS2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Advancements in 3D object detection have seen the adoption of 2D detection principles, a study has directly predicted 3D bounding boxes based on 2D bounding boxes <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>. Innovations like DETR3D <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite> have bypassed the need for NMS post-processing for end-to-end 3D bounding box predictions.The generation of bird’s-eye view (BEV) features is often achieved through various techniques. Methods like IPM <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite> convert the perspective view directly into BEV, while approaches such as Lift-Splat <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite> rely on depth distribution. Unlike methods that only focus on spatial information, certain works <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite> also consider temporal aspects by stacking BEV features from multiple timestamps. Studies have also explored the conversion of multi-camera features to BEV in map segmentation tasks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>. There are architectures like PYVA <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite> that apply transformers for this translation but face challenges in computational efficiency when fusing features from multiple cameras. In summary, while the field of camera-based 3D perception has seen a wide range of intricate methodologies, our work aims to achieve similar levels of BEV generation by utilizing the simpler, yet effective, features of YOLO for 2D object detection. This aligns with the principle of Occam’s razor, suggesting that less complex approaches can also yield promising results.</p>

<div id="S2.SS3.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Deep learning techniques have become the norm for predicting trajectories, with notable works like <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>, and <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite> leading the way.

While deep learning provides powerful tools for trajectory prediction, traditional simulation methods also offer valuable insights for autonomous driving scenarios. Advanced driving simulators that utilize manually-designed rules for agent behavior represent an alternative approach to simulation. Well-known instances of this category include SUMO <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite> and CARLA <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>. To summarize, both deep learning and traditional simulation methods provide valuable approaches for trajectory prediction in the realm of autonomous driving. In line with this, our research seeks to utilize YOLO-BEV generation in conjunction with our in-development driving simulator. The goal is to facilitate robust and efficient testing for end-to-end autonomous driving solutions. It’s worth noting that this paper will not delve extensively into the subject of trajectory planning; however, it constitutes an area of related research interest for us.</p>

<p id="S3.SS4.SSS0.Px2.p1.11" class="ltx_p">By leveraging PyTorch’s robust tensor operations, this intricate adjustment mechanism ensures that the predicted coordinates are systematically transmuted into a form that is globally informative.

<p id="S3.SS5.p2.1" class="ltx_p">For the spatial aspect, we introduce the bounding box loss, which uses Mean Square Error (MSE) as the underlying loss metric. Given the predicted bounding box coordinates and orientation, these are transformed into Axis-Aligned Bounding Boxes (AABBs) to facilitate the computation of Intersection-over-Union (IoU) against the ground truth boxes, also transformed into AABBs. Figure <a href="#S3.F6" title="Figure 6 ‣ III-E Loss Function ‣ III YOLO-BEV ‣ YOLO-BEV: Generating Bird’s-Eye View in the Same Way as 2D Object Detection" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">6</span></a> elucidates the Axis-Aligned Bounding Boxes (AABBs) used in our bounding box loss calculation. The figure illustrates two object bounding boxes and their corresponding AABBs. An intersection of these AABBs is also shown. It is worth noting that while AABBs simplify the computation of Intersection-over-Union (IoU), they may generally result in slightly larger IoU values compared to more exact oriented bounding box methods. This is because the boxes are aligned to the axis and may encompass extra area that is not a true part of the overlap. Importantly, empirical testing has shown that this slight overestimation is generally acceptable, as it still effectively aids in reducing the loss during training. Mathematically, the bounding box loss is defined as:</p>

<p id="S3.SS5.p6.1" class="ltx_p">To provide a more comprehensive overview, our loss function is not an isolated innovation but rather an advanced adaptation, largely inspired by the YOLO architecture’s approach to loss formulation. Much like YOLO, which has set industry standards for real-time object detection, we leverage a similar multi-component loss function that handles both spatial coordinates and confidence scores. This intricately designed loss function embodies the crucial attributes of object localization and confidence estimation, tailored to serve the unique requirements of our model. By integrating these YOLO-inspired components, we are able to establish a robust yet flexible loss function. This configuration makes our approach particularly apt for addressing the intricate challenges commonly faced in autonomous driving applications, such as real-time object tracking and high-fidelity localization.</p>

<p id="S5.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS) has been a staple in object detection tasks to refine and reduce multiple bounding boxes into the most probable one. While effective in many scenarios, NMS introduces nuances in the context of generating bird’s-eye view maps for autonomous driving. Unlike standard deployments, the NMS technique used here must delicately balance the prevention of rectangle overlap with the risk of shifting rectangles that represent vehicles, possibly leading to imprecise vehicle positions.</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.SS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">One of the challenges is that NMS traditionally prioritizes the highest-scoring rectangle, which could, in specific settings, result in the misalignment or shifting of bounding boxes representing adjacent or closely-spaced vehicles.
