<p id="id2.2" class="ltx_p">Recently, deep convolution neural networks (CNNs) have promoted accuracy in the computer vision field. However, the high computation and memory cost prevents its development in edge devices with limited resources, such as intelligent satellites and unmanned aerial vehicles. Considering the computation complexity, we propose a <span id="id2.2.1" class="ltx_text ltx_framed ltx_framed_underline">G</span>uided <span id="id2.2.2" class="ltx_text ltx_framed ltx_framed_underline">H</span>ybrid Quantization with <span id="id2.2.3" class="ltx_text ltx_framed ltx_framed_underline">O</span>ne-to-one <span id="id2.2.4" class="ltx_text ltx_framed ltx_framed_underline">S</span>elf-<span id="id2.2.5" class="ltx_text ltx_framed ltx_framed_underline">T</span>eaching (<span id="id2.2.6" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">GHOST</span>) framework. More concretely, we first design a structure called guided quantization self-distillation (GQSD), which is an innovative idea for realizing lightweight through the synergy of quantization and distillation. The training process of the quantization model is guided by its full-precision model, which is time-saving and cost-saving without preparing a huge pre-trained model in advance. Second, we put forward a hybrid quantization (HQ) module to obtain the optimal bit width automatically under a constrained condition where a threshold for distribution distance between the center and samples is applied in the weight value search space. Third, in order to improve information transformation, we propose a one-to-one self-teaching (OST) module to give the student network a ability of self-judgment. A switch control machine (SCM) builds a bridge between the student network and teacher network in the same location to help the teacher to reduce wrong guidance and impart vital knowledge to the student. This distillation method allows a model to learn from itself and gain substantial improvement without any additional supervision. Extensive experiments on a multimodal dataset (VEDAI) and single-modality datasets (DOTA, NWPU, and DIOR) show that object detection based on GHOST outperforms the existing detectors. The tiny parameters (<math id="id1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="&lt;" display="inline"><semantics id="id1.1.m1.1a"><mo id="id1.1.m1.1.1" xref="id1.1.m1.1.1.cmml">&lt;</mo><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="id1.1.m1.1b"><lt id="id1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="id1.1.m1.1.1"></lt></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="id1.1.m1.1c">&lt;</annotation></semantics></math>9.7 MB) and Bit-Operations (BOPs) (<math id="id2.2.m2.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="&lt;" display="inline"><semantics id="id2.2.m2.1a"><mo id="id2.2.m2.1.1" xref="id2.2.m2.1.1.cmml">&lt;</mo><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="id2.2.m2.1b"><lt id="id2.2.m2.1.1.cmml" xref="id2.2.m2.1.1"></lt></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="id2.2.m2.1c">&lt;</annotation></semantics></math>2158 G) compared with any remote sensing-based, lightweight or distillation-based algorithms demonstrate the superiority in the lightweight design domain.

<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Object detection in aerial images plays an important role in military security aiming to locate interested objects (e.g., vehicles, airplanes) on the ground and identifying their categories <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. From universal detectors for natural images such as YOLOv3 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>, Faster R-CNN <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>, FCOS <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite> are widely introduced in the field of remote sensing (RS); more and more dedicated detectors for RS scene are designed and improved with the requirements of objects tasks.
However, the large complexity of the object detection network is under-investigated, which limits the practical deployment under resource-limited scenarios and bring a heavy burden to process massive multimodal images collected from satellites, drone, and airplanes. Hence, a series of compression schemes have been proposed to settle this problem, such as pruning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>, quantization <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite> and distillation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>.</p>

Instead of implementing two steps in traditional distillation, which means that to train a large teacher model comes first, following by distilling the knowledge from it to the student model, we propose a two-step mixed-bit self distillation framework, in which the training process of the second quantization step is based on the pretrained small full-precision model. The proposed framework not only requires less computation cost (from 20797 G BOPs to 692 G BOPs on VEDAI dataset, a 30X faster training cost), but also can accomplish much higher accuracy (from 75.84% in traditional quantization to 80.31% on SuperYOLO)

R-CNN <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite> creates a new era as one of the most successive two-stage algorithms owing to the upgrading of the second-stage classifier to a convolution network.

Recently, a series of SSD <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>, <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>, <a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite> and YOLO <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>, <a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>, <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite> have renewed interest in the one-stage object detection. SSD implements independent detection on multiscale feature maps, while the YOLO utilizes combined detection. These methods have paid more attention to speed, but their accuracy trails behind that of tow-stage methods. YOLOv2 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite> modifies the location regression pattern depending on bounding boxes. YOLOv3 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite> considers multiscale objects and detects them in the three scales, which can realize the detection of multiple sizes of objects. YOLOv4 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite> introduces more data augmentation tricks, activation functions, backbone structures, and IoU loss metrics to enhance the robustness of the network. YOLOv5 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite> releases four different size models, where the basic structures are identical, which allows YOLOv5 to have higher flexibility and versatility in practical applications. To solve the dilemma of the category imbalance, RetinaNet <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite> reduces the weight of massive amounts of simple negative samples in training by designing a focal term for cross-entropy loss. As FCOS <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite> which belongs to anchor-free methods is proposed, adjusting hyperparameters and calculations related to anchor boxes has been avoided.

<div id="S2.SS2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Although the speed of the one-stage detection network is superior, its large model and high computation complexity still deserves to explore. Some researches focus on the design of a lightweight backbone. MobileNetV2 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite> utilizes the depthwise separable convolutions to build a lightweight model. ShuffleNet <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite>, and SqueezeNet <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite> also effectively reduces the memory footprint during inference and speed up the detection. In the literature, a potential direction of model compression is knowledge distillation (KD) which concentrates on transferring knowledge from a heavy model (teacher) to a light one (teacher) to improve the light model’s performance without introducing extra costs <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>, <a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>]</cite>. Whereas the knowledge distillation enables utilizing the larger network in a condensed manner, the pretraining of the large network requires extra substantial computation resources to prepare the teacher network <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>. The preparation of the pretrained teacher network is time-consuming and cost-consuming. The self-knowledge distillation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite> can overcome this problem by distilling its own knowledge without prior preparation of the teacher network. Quantization is another way to compact the model directly and compress the ponderous network by using low-bit representation. Mixed-precision quantization method uses different numbers of bits for a given data type to represent values in weight tensor. Many works <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>, <a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>, <a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>]</cite> have shown that the mixed-precision method is efficient for quantizing network layers that have different importance and sensitiveness for the bit width. However, trivially applying quantization to CNNs usually leads to inferior performance if the compression bit decreases to a low level.</p>

<p id="S3.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The student model size is commonly designed in a small size to achieve the purpose of model compression in which the performance of the student can chase the teacher but consumes a computing-friendly resource. Nonetheless, the computation cost of the student model is larger than the pruning method directly completed on the teacher model. This demonstrates that the existing KD-based quantization algorithms still have great potential room for improvement.</p>

The SCM controls the distillation switch and determines which knowledge should be delivered dynamically. Knowledge from each teacher feature is transferred to the student with similarities identified by SCM by self-distillation with the same structure.

<p id="S3.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Powerful deep networks normally benefit from large model capacities but induce high computational and storage costs. Modal quantization is a promising approach to compress deep neural networks, making it possible to be deployed on edge devices.
The quantization operator divides the weight into different fixed values by a quantization function which can be regarded as a cluster of convolution kernels in substance. The different scale weights are clustered to a certain value.

As described in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>, the first and last layers in the network are sensitive to performance during the process of quantization. Based on this intuition, the last detection layer keeps intact to avoid potential degradation of detection performance.</p>

<p id="S3.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Previous mixed quantization approaches pay more attention to the bit-width selection <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite> which costs a lot of resources to obtain the optimal decision. Our hybrid quantization method can make a quick decision with less computation cost. The loss of performance is fixed by the guide of distillation.
In general, previous distillation algorithms are a full precision network, so the network weights are in the same order of magnitude, and the feature maps generated by the teacher network or the student network are similar. However, for the quantitative network, the feature map generated by the quantitative network as a student network will have obvious weight information loss due to the increase of the zero content, resulting in some differences between the feature map of the teacher network and the feature map of the student network, which makes it difficult for the teacher network to directly restrict the quantitative student network from the feature layer. Therefore we proposed an OST to conquer this question.
SCM first calculates the inner connected relationship between the full-precision and quantization network. The distillation switch (DS) chooses the core information between matched student and teacher features by this relationship matrix. We sketch the architecture of self-feature distillation in Fig. <a href="#S2.F2" title="Figure 2 ‣ II Related Work ‣ Guided Hybrid Quantization for Object Detection in Multimodal Remote Sensing Imagery via One-to-one Self-teaching" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>.</p>

In addition, data is augmented with Hue Saturation Value (HSV), multi-scale, translation, left-right flip, and mosaic. The augmentation strategy is canceled in the test stage. The standard Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) is used to train the network with a momentum of 0.937, weight decay of 0.0005 for the Nesterov accelerated gradients utilized, and a batch size of 2. The learning rate is set to 0.01 initially. All the baseline training process is completed from scratch without any pre-trained model while the GHOST is carried on the baseline model.
In the test stage, the IoU threshold of non-maximum suppression is 0.6 on NWPU VHR-10 and VEDAI, and it is 0.4 on DOTA and DIOR.

Owning to the GQSD design idea, our student model is very lightweight. We compare the GHOST and the teacher model in terms of parameters and BOPs on the four datasets. As Fig. <a href="#S4.F6" title="Figure 6 ‣ IV Experimental Results ‣ Guided Hybrid Quantization for Object Detection in Multimodal Remote Sensing Imagery via One-to-one Self-teaching" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">6</span></a> shows, GHOST has smaller model parameters, and fewer BOPs compared with the teacher model no matter in which dataset. Hence, our compression strategy for the lightweight model is more practical to be deployed on intelligent terminals.</p>

<div id="S5.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we propose a GHOST framework for a lightweight object detection method in remote sensing imagery. We first design a guided quantization self-distillation structure which is not only a training technique to preserve model performance but also a method to compress and accelerate models. Although most of the previous research focuses on knowledge transfer among different models, we believe that inside distillation is also very promising. Secondly, we propose a hybrid quantization that captures the optimal bit width selection based on an adaptive way in the weight value research space to break the limit of the fixed quantization model accuracy. Thirdly, the proposed one-to-one self-teaching module gives the student network of self-judgment through a switch control machine that accurately handles the knowledge transformation. It can dynamically discriminate the wrong guidance and mine the effective knowledge from the teacher. The experiments based on the VEDAI, DOTA, NWPU, and DIOR datasets certify that our GHOST achieves SOTA performance compared with other detectors. It can well balance the tradeoff between accuracy and specific resource constraints.</p>
