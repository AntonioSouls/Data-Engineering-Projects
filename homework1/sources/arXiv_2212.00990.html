<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">Camouflaged object detection (COD) aims to detect/segment camouflaged objects embedded in the environment, which has attracted increasing attention over the past decades. Although several COD methods have been developed, they still suffer from unsatisfactory performance due to the intrinsic similarities between the foreground objects and background surroundings. In this paper, we propose a novel Feature Aggregation and Propagation Network (FAP-Net) for camouflaged object detection. Specifically, we propose a Boundary Guidance Module (BGM) to explicitly model the boundary characteristic, which can provide boundary-enhanced features to boost the COD performance. To capture the scale variations of the camouflaged objects, we propose a Multi-scale Feature Aggregation Module (MFAM) to characterize the multi-scale information from each layer and obtain the aggregated feature representations. Furthermore, we propose a Cross-level Fusion and Propagation Module (CFPM). In the CFPM, the feature fusion part can effectively integrate the features from adjacent layers to exploit the cross-level correlations, and the feature propagation part can transmit valuable context information from the encoder to the decoder network via a gate unit. Finally, we formulate a unified and end-to-end trainable framework where cross-level features can be effectively fused and propagated for capturing rich context information. Extensive experiments on three benchmark camouflaged datasets demonstrate that our FAP-Net outperforms other state-of-the-art COD models. Moreover, our model can be extended to the polyp segmentation task, and the comparison results further validate the effectiveness of the proposed model in segmenting polyps.

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Camouflaged Object Detection (COD) aims to identify objects with a similar texture to their surroundings. Camouflaged objects can be roughly classified into two types, <em id="S1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">i.e.</em>, natural and artificial camouflaged objects. Natural camouflaged objects hide in the background environment with their own advantages (<em id="S1.p1.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">e.g.</em>, color, shape, etc.) to adapt to the environment
<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>, while artificial camouflaged objects often occur in a real-world scenario. It has a variety of applications, such as security and surveillance (<em id="S1.p1.1.3" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">e.g.</em>, search-and-rescue work <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>), agriculture (<em id="S1.p1.1.4" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">e.g.</em>, detecting agricultural pests), and medical imaging analysis (<em id="S1.p1.1.5" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">e.g.</em>, lung infection segmentation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>, and polyp segmentation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>). Therefore, due to its application and scientific value, COD has attracted more and more attention.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Compared to generic object detection <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>, COD is a more challenging task due to the high intrinsic similarities between the camouflaged objects and their background. Camouflaged objects often have a diversity of size, color, shape, and texture, which aggravates difficulties in accurately detecting camouflaged objects. To overcome this challenge, various COD models have been developed to improve detection performance. In the early years, several traditional COD methods <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite> have been proposed to segment camouflaged objects by using manually designed features. Recently, due to the development of deep learning-based representation methods, many deep learning-based COD methods have been proposed to obtain state-of-the-art performance <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>. For example, ANet <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite> utilizes a classification network to determine whether the image contains camouflaged objects or not, and then uses a fully convolutional network for COD. SINet <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite> is proposed to utilize a search module to coarsely select the candidate regions of camouflaged objects and then proposes an identification module to precisely detect camouflaged objects. More importantly, a large-scale dataset for COD also is proposed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>, which advances this field and promotes more explorations.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Although progress has been made in the COD field, existing methods could still misunderstand camouflaged objects as the background due to their similar texture, and there is still considerable room for improving COD. <em id="S1.p3.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">First</em>, scale variation is one of the major challenges in the COD, how to effectively characterize the multi-scale information from a convolutional layer deserves further exploration. <em id="S1.p3.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">Second</em>, several COD methods often integrate multi-level features and then feed them into the decoder network, while they ignore the contributions of the feature representation from different encoder blocks. <em id="S1.p3.1.3" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">Third</em>, due to the boundary between a camouflaged object and its background is not sharp, thus it is helpful to locate the boundaries of camouflaged objects or incorporate boundary-attention features for improving the COD performance.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">To this end, we propose a novel COD framework, <em id="S1.p4.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">i.e.</em>, Feature Aggregation and Propagation Network (FAP-Net), to accurately detect camouflaged objects. Specifically, we first propose a Boundary Guidance Module (BGM) to learn the boundary-enhanced representations, which are then incorporated into the decoder network via a layer-wise manner to help the model detect the boundaries of camouflaged objects. Moreover, we propose a Multi-scale Feature Aggregation Module (MFAM) to exploit multi-scale information from a single convolutional block. To effectively integrate the multi-level features, we propose a Cross-level Fusion and Propagation Module (CFPM) to first fuse cross-level features. In addition, the feature propagation part can adaptively weigh the contributions of features from the encoder and decoder, which makes the decoder obtain more effective features from the encoder to boost the COD performance. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that our FAP-Net performs favorably against other state-of-the-art COD methods under different evaluation metrics. Moreover, the proposed model has also been extended to the polyp segmentation task, and the effectiveness can be further validated.</p>

<div id="S2.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Early COD methods focused on detecting the foreground areas, and proposed several methods based on handcrafted features, including color, intensity, shape, direction, and edge <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>. For instance, Mondal <span id="S2.SS1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite> proposed a tracking-by-detection strategy to discover and track camouflaged objects, in which multiple types of features (including histogram of orientation gradients, CIELab, and locally adaptive ternary pattern) are integrated to represent a camouflaged object. However, due to the limited-expression ability of handcrafted features, these early models often are unable to obtain promising performance. To address this, several deep learning based methods have been developed and obtain promising camouflaged object detection performance. For example, Li <span id="S2.SS1.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite> proposed a new camouflaged color target detection model based on image enhancement, in which the image enhancement algorithm is adapted to capture the difference between the target and background features.

For example, in semantic segmentation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>, <a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>, <a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite>, feature maps from selected levels are utilized with a shortcut connection to provide multiple granularities for boosting the segmentation performance. In visual recognition <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>, <a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>, <a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>]</cite>, deep features from some selected layers can be merged together to improve the final layer representation.
Besides, Zhang <span id="S2.SS2.p2.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>]</cite> proposed a generic aggregating multi-level convolutional feature framework for salient object detection, which integrates multi-level feature maps into multiple resolutions by incorporating coarse semantics and fine details. Hu <span id="S2.SS2.p2.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>]</cite> proposed to fully exploit the complementary information from multiple layers by recurrently concatenating multi-layer features to locate salient objects.
In addition, several multi-level feature fusion strategies and multi-modal interactions have been developed and applied in several detection and
segmentation tasks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>, <a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">38</a>, <a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">39</a>, <a href="#bib.bib40" title="" class="ltx_ref">40</a>]</cite>.</p>

<p id="S2.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The gated mechanism is proposed to adaptively control the flow of information and is widely applied in several computer vision tasks. For example, Cheng <span id="S2.SS3.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib41" title="" class="ltx_ref">41</a>]</cite> designed a gated fusion module to adaptively integrate the two modalities (<em id="S2.SS3.p1.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">i.e.</em>, RGB and depth) for object recognition. Zhang <span id="S2.SS3.p1.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib42" title="" class="ltx_ref">42</a>]</cite> proposed a gated bi-directional message passing module to adaptively incorporate multi-level features. Liu <span id="S2.SS3.p1.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib43" title="" class="ltx_ref">43</a>]</cite> regarded an adaptive gated fusion module as a part of the discriminator network to adaptively integrate the RGB and depth features, which is beneficial to obtaining an effective gated fusion of saliency maps during adversarial learning. Zhao <span id="S2.SS3.p1.1.5" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib44" title="" class="ltx_ref">44</a>]</cite> utilized multilevel gate units to balance the contribution of each encoder path and also suppress the activation of the features from non-salient regions. Zhou <span id="S2.SS3.p1.1.6" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib45" title="" class="ltx_ref">45</a>]</cite> proposed a gate fusion module to regularize the process of feature fusion, leading to obtaining better results via filtering noise and interference. Most above methods often consider the information fusion or interaction between different levels either in the encoder or decoder. We integrate the features from the encoder network and the decoder one via a gate propagation strategy, which automatically learns the contributions of different features from the encoder and decoder to boost the segmentation performance.</p>

After that, the aggregated features are fed into the proposed CFPM to effectively integrate cross-level features and propagate the fused features to the decoder network. More importantly, the boundary-enhanced feature representations can be also combined into the decoder network. Finally, multiple side-out supervised strategies are implemented to boost the COD performance. We will provide the details of each key component below.</p>

In the COD task, since camouflaged objects are visually embedded in their background, which makes that the boundary between a camouflaged object and its surrounding background is not sharp. Therefore, it is critical to locate the boundaries of camouflaged objects, in which boundary information provides useful constraints to guide feature extraction during camouflaged object detection.

Because each convolutional layer only is able to handle a special scale, it is demanded to capture multi-scale information from a single layer to characterize variations of the object’s scale.

<p id="S3.SS3.p3.1" class="ltx_p">It is worth noting that our MFAM introduces different sizes of convolution kernels to adaptively extract features in different scales, and multi-scale features interact with each other to produce more effective and discriminate image information. Then, the aggregated features can be obtained by fusing multi-scale features with a residual connection, which makes that our model can effectively deal with scale variations.</p>

<p id="S3.SS4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Effective fusion of cross-level features by exploiting their correlations often boosts the learning performance. In addition, accurate camouflaged object detection usually relies on the effective features provided by the encoder. However, existing methods directly pass all features to the decoder network, while ignoring the contributions of features from different levels. In this case, the valuable context information can be adequately propagated into the decoder, resulting in unsatisfactory detection results. To lighten these effects, we propose a Cross-level Fusion and Propagation Module (CFPM), which includes two key parts, <em id="S3.SS4.p1.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">i.e.</em>, cross-feature fusion and feature propagation.</p>

Therefore, the normalized feature maps can be considered as feature-level attention maps to adaptively enhance the feature representation. In this case, the fused feature map is used to enhance the cross-level features to capture their correlation. Besides, to preserve the original information of each feature, a residual connection is adapted to combine the enhanced features with their original features. Therefore, we obtain the enhanced features as follows:</p>

On the CHAMELEON dataset, from the results, it can be seen that our method outperforms all the state-of-the-art methods in all evaluation metrics. LSR and PFNet achieve relatively better COD performance than other comparison methods. Besides, some methods (<em id="S4.SS2.SSS2.p1.12.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">e.g.</em>, EGNet <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib64" title="" class="ltx_ref">64</a>]</cite> and PFANet <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib60" title="" class="ltx_ref">60</a>]</cite>) also utilize auxiliary edge or boundary information and still fail to locate camouflaged objects, while our model can effectively locate them and achieve the best performance. This is because our model can fully capture the multi-scale information to deal with the objects’ scale variations, and the fused features cross-level features from the encoder can be propagated to the decoder for providing much useful context information to improve the COD performance. On the CAMO dataset, our model consistently obtains the best performance, further demonstrating its robustness in locating camouflaged objects under challenging factors.

In the “B1” experiment, we add the MFAM, while other key components are removed and the related experimental settings are similar to “A3”. In addition, we adopt the Inception module <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib71" title="" class="ltx_ref">71</a>]</cite> instead of MFAM, and this experiment is denoted as “B2”. In the “C1” experiment, we further add the cross-level feature fusion part of the CFPM, while other key components are removed. In the “C2” experiment, we utilize the full CFPM, while only BGM is removed. Moreover, in the “D” experiment, we adopt the Attention Gate in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib70" title="" class="ltx_ref">70</a>]</cite> instead of the proposed CFPM. Finally, we show the experiment of our full model in the “E” experiment.

In the proposed MFAM, we adopt multi-scale convolutional kernels to extract the aggregated features from the original layers, which can capture multi-scale information to deal with the scale variations of camouflaged objects. Besides, comparing “B2” with “B1”, it can be seen that our model using MFAM performs better than that using the Inception module in terms of most evaluation metrics.</p>

<p id="S4.SS3.p4.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S4.SS3.p4.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Effectiveness of CFPM</span>. Comparing “C1” with “B1”, it can be seen that the feature fusion part in the CFPM can improve the COD performance, which indicates that the part effectively integrates the features from adjacent levels to exploit the correlations from cross-level features. Comparing “C1” with “C2”, we can see that the feature propagation part further boosts the COD performance in CFPM. Therefore, combined with the two ablation experiments, the effectiveness of CFPM can be well validated. The proposed CFPM first carries out cross-level fusion and then conducts feature propagation, which can effectively propagate the useful information from the encoder to the decoder network for boosting the COD performance. Besides, comparing “C2” with “D”, it can be observed that the proposed COD framework using CFPM performs better than that using the simple Attention Gate unit <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib70" title="" class="ltx_ref">70</a>]</cite>. Therefore, the effectiveness of the proposed CFPM can be further validated.</p>

Comparing “C2” with “E”, it can be seen that the BGM can further improve the COD performance. This is mainly because the boundary-enhanced features are integrated into the decoder, which can provide much low-level structure information to locate the boundaries of camouflaged objects.</p>

<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we have proposed a novel camouflaged object detection framework, <em id="S5.p1.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">i.e.</em>, Feature Aggregation and Propagation Network (FAP-Net). We first utilize the proposed BGM to explicitly model the boundary characteristic, and the obtained boundary-enhanced feature representations are integrated into the decoder to boost the COD performance. Then, we propose the MFAM to extract the multi-scale information from a single layer for dealing with scale variations. Moreover, we design the CFPM to effectively fuse cross-level features and then propagate them to the decoder network with the valuable context information from the encoder. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our FAP-Net outperforms other state-of-the-art COD methods. Furthermore, we apply FAP-Net to the polyp segmentation task, and the results show that our model outperforms other polyp segmentation methods.</p>
