<p class="ltx_p" id="id2.id1">This study introduces a training-free conditional diffusion model for learning unknown stochastic differential equations (SDEs) using data. The proposed approach addresses key challenges in computational efficiency and accuracy for modeling SDEs by utilizing a score-based diffusion model to approximate their stochastic flow map. Unlike the existing methods, this technique is based on an analytically derived closed-form exact score function, which can be efficiently estimated by Monte Carlo method using the trajectory data, and eliminates the need for neural network training to learn the score function. By generating labeled data through solving the corresponding reverse ordinary differential equation, the approach enables supervised learning of the flow map. Extensive numerical experiments across various SDE types, including linear, nonlinear, and multi-dimensional systems, demonstrate the versatility and effectiveness of the method. The learned models exhibit significant improvements in predicting both short-term and long-term behaviors of unknown stochastic systems, often surpassing baseline methods like GANs in estimating drift and diffusion coefficients.</p>

<p class="ltx_p" id="S1.p1.1">Stochastic differential equations (SDEs) play a pivotal role in scientific and engineering simulations, particularly when modeling large ensembles of particles. These equations find diverse applications across fields such as plasma physics, where they describe electron and ion interactions with electromagnetic fields, and fluid mechanics, where they model the dispersion of pollutants in oceans and the atmosphere. SDEs also prove valuable in simulating biological and chemical systems. From a mathematical standpoint, SDEs offer a discrete particle representation that corresponds to the continuous Fokker-Planck equation, underpinning Monte Carlo methods for solving partial differential equations. While highly valuable, the use of SDEs faces a significant challenge: for many complex systems it is difficult, if not impossible, to derive accurate SDE models that capture all the important physics embedded in the systems.</p>

<p class="ltx_p" id="S1.p2.1">Recent years have seen a growing interest in developing data-driven approaches for uncovering unknown dynamical systems. The primary objective is to unearth the core principles or mathematical formulations underlying observational data, enabling the creation of effective predictive models for unexplored dynamics. When dealing with stochastic systems, the presence of data noise and the inability to directly observe the system’s inherent randomness present considerable obstacles in understanding the system. Most existing approaches concentrate on analyzing Itô-type SDEs.

<p class="ltx_p" id="S1.p3.1">Despite the success of generative models
in learning SDEs, there is a significant challenge in training the generative models to achieve the desired accuracy. Due to the lack of labeled data, training generative models is usually classified as unsupervised learning.
Various unsupervised loss functions have been defined to train generative models, including adversarial loss for GANs <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2410.03108v1#bib.bib11" title="">11</a>]</cite>, the maximum likelihood loss for normalizing flows <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2410.03108v1#bib.bib14" title="">14</a>]</cite>, and the score matching losses for diffusion models

Specifically, we derived the closed form of the exact score function for the conditional diffusion model used to approximate the stochastic flow map of the target SDE. In fact, the score function can be represented as an expectation with respect to the conditional distribution defined by the flow map. However, since we use trajectories of the target SDE as observation data, we do not have a large number of samples from each conditional distribution. Instead, the trajectory data can be treated as samples from the joint distribution of the input and the output of the flow map. Thus, we propose an approximate score function that involves a weighted expectation with respect to the joint distribution, and use Monte Carlo estimators (based on the trajectory data) to approximate the expectation. This approach allows us to directly generate samples of the target flow map. With the estimated score function, we then generate labeled data by solving the corresponding reverse ordinary differential equation, instead of the reverse SDE for the diffusion model. Following this, we employ the generated labeled data to train a simple fully connected neural network to learn the flow map via supervised learning. Our method shows remarkable accuracy in predicting both short-term and long-term behaviors of stochastic systems, often outperforming baseline methods such as GANs <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2410.03108v1#bib.bib6" title="">6</a>]</cite> in terms of drift and diffusion coefficient estimation, as well as in predicting mean and standard deviation at termination times.</p>

The standard score-based diffusion model uses a neural network to learn the score function, which is computationally intensive because it requires to solve the reverse SDE to generate each sample of the target distribution. Moreover, when estimating the score function, the neural network is trained in an unsupervised manner due to the lack of labeled data, which requires storing a large number of trajectories of the forward SDE to be used to train the score function approximation.</p>

For each example, the neural network is trained for 2,000 epochs using the Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 0.01. During the training period, the best neural network parameters are saved based on validation performance to ensure optimal training loss. Since the neural network structure is simple, we use the simple grid search method to tune the number of neurons in the hidden layer.</p>

<div class="ltx_para" id="S5.p1">
<p class="ltx_p" id="S5.p1.1">In this paper, we have introduced a novel training-free conditional diffusion model for learning the flow map of stochastic dynamical systems. Our approach offers a promising alternative to traditional methods for solving SDEs, addressing key challenges in computational efficiency and accuracy. The proposed method leverages the power of score-based diffusion models to generate samples from complex distributions without the need for extensive training data or computationally intensive solving procedures. By introducing a conditional framework, we have enabled our model to capture the dynamics of SDEs across a wide range of initial conditions and system parameters. Our numerical experiments, spanning various types of SDEs including linear, nonlinear, and multi-dimensional systems, demonstrate the effectiveness and versatility of our approach. The model shows remarkable accuracy in predicting both short-term and long-term behaviors of stochastic systems, often outperforming baseline methods such as GANs in terms of drift and diffusion function estimation, as well as in predicting mean and standard deviation at termination times.</p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="S5.p2">
<p class="ltx_p" id="S5.p2.1">While our proposed method has shown promising results, there are several avenues for future research that could further enhance its capabilities and applications. First, extending the model to handle more complex stochastic processes, such as jump diffusions or fractional Brownian motion, could broaden its applicability in fields like finance and environmental science. Second, investigating the theoretical properties of the proposed score estimation technique, including convergence rates and error bounds, would provide a stronger mathematical foundation for the method. Third, exploring the integration of this approach with other machine learning techniques, such as transfer learning or meta-learning, could potentially improve its performance on new, unseen stochastic systems. Fourth, applying this method to real-world problems in areas such as climate modeling, epidemiology, or quantum systems could demonstrate its practical value and potentially lead to new insights in these fields. Finally, optimizing the computational efficiency of the algorithm, particularly for high-dimensional systems, remains an important area for future work. This could involve developing advanced parallelization strategies or leveraging specialized hardware accelerators to further reduce computation time.</p>
