<p id="id8.id1" class="ltx_p">The majority of current salient object detection (SOD) models are focused on designing a series of decoders based on fully convolutional networks (FCNs) or Transformer architectures and integrating them in a skillful manner. These models have achieved remarkable high performance and made significant contributions to the development of SOD. Their primary research objective is to develop novel algorithms that can outperform state-of-the-art models, a task that is extremely difficult and time-consuming. In contrast, this paper proposes a positive feedback method based on F-measure value for SOD, aiming to improve the accuracy of saliency prediction using existing methods. Specifically, our proposed method takes an image to be detected and inputs it into several existing models to obtain their respective prediction maps. These prediction maps are then fed into our positive feedback method to generate the final prediction result, without the need for careful decoder design or model training. Through applying the positive feedback method for decision fusion of multi-model perception results. Moreover, our method is adaptive and can be implemented based on existing models without any restrictions. Experimental results on five publicly available datasets show that our proposed positive feedback method outperforms the latest 12 methods in five evaluation metrics for saliency map prediction. Additionally, we conducted a robustness experiment, which shows that when at least one good prediction result exists in the selected existing model, our proposed approach can ensure that the prediction result is not worse. Our approach achieves a prediction speed of 20 frames per second (FPS) when evaluated on a low configuration host and after removing the prediction time overhead of inserted models. These results highlight the effectiveness, efficiency, and robustness of our proposed approach for salient object detection. Code and Saliency maps will be available.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Salient object detection (SOD) aims to mimic the human visual perception system to capture the most prominent regions in given images or videos. It can serve as a pre-processing step for other realated computer vision tasks, including object tracking<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>, action recognition<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>, video segmentation<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>, and image captioning<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Existing SOD models can be mainly divided into traditional algorithm-based and deep learning-based approaches. Traditional SOD methods rely on handcrafted features and use these features to predict saliency maps in a bottom-up manner. Common handcrafted features include center prior<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite> and distance transform<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>, which only contain low-level clues and perform poorly in complex scenes. With the emergence of deep learning techniques, SOD has made remarkable progress. Recent SOD models are mainly implemented based on fully convolutional networks (FCNs) and Transformer architectures, among which FCN is still the mainstream SOD architecture. SOD FCNs-based models mainly design a series of decoders around feature extraction, refinement or enhancement, and multi-level feature fusion and set specific loss functions to assist model training<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite><cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite><cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite><cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite><cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite><cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite><cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite><cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite><cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite><cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>. Inspired by the impressive performance of the Transformer in the field of natural language processing (NLP), researchers have also carried out some innovative work using the Transformer architecture in the SOD research field and achieved impressive performance improvements. These models mainly rely on the powerful long-distance feature correlation capture ability of the Transformer architecture and help the model generate more complete predictions by effectively extracting global contextual clues<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite><cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>. In addition, a hybrid architecture of FCN and Transformer has been proposed by integrating the advantages of both models<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite><cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>.</p>

<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">The main research content of the above work is to design different network models carefully based on the characteristics of the SOD task and demonstrate the performance beyond the previous proposed models, playing an extremely important role in the rapid development process of the SOD research field. However, the process of carrying out these works is usually challenging, time-consuming, and requires difficultly obtaining higher performance than the latest methods. Therefore, in contrast to the above work, this paper proposes a positive feedback approach based on F-measure value for SOD, which is based on existing methods to obtain more accurate prediction results. The approach allows any existing method to be inserted, such as traditional algorithms and various deep learning methods, and can achieve performance beyond the inserted methods.</p>

<div id="S2.SS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The successful performance of SOD models depends on the effective integration of multi-level features. Several studies have highlighted the significant differences between the low-level and high-level features extracted from backbone networks. To address this issue, Chen et al.<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite> proposed a progressive context aware feature aggregation module, while Dai et al.<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite> developed a middle layer feature extraction module to achieve better feature fusion results. Moreover, the integration of multiscale features has been shown to improve SOD detection performance in various studies. For instance, Zhang et al.<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite> developed a neural structure based search unit to automatically determine the multiscale features that need to be aggregated. Fang et al.<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite> proposed a densely nested-based network framework to utilize multiscale high-level feature maps effectively. Meanwhile, Zhuge et al.<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite> used various multiscale feature extraction methods to obtain diverse multiscale features and designed an integrity channel enhancement module to highlight salient objects. Base on work<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>, Wu et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite> proposed a dynamic pyramid convolution to extract multiscale features instead of fixed size convolutions. Effective supervision strategy have also been employed to help models predict salient objects more accurately. For instance, Wei et al.<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite> proposed pixel position aware losss to guide networks to pay more attention to local details, while Yang et al.<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite> proposed progressive self-guided loss to guide network learning to more complete salient regions. Additionally, Xu et al.<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite> designed a knowledge review network to roughly locate salient regions first and then finely segment salient objects. Wu et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite> proposed a decomposition and completion network to predict the saliency, edge, and skeleton maps respectively, and then filled the saliency map using edge and skeleton maps.</p>

In order to verify our method more conveniently, we use the precious models in advance to generate saliency maps, which are marked as <math id="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.5" class="ltx_Math" alttext="Smp_{i}(i=1,2,3,4)" display="inline"><semantics id="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.5a"><mrow id="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.5.5" xref="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.5.5.cmml"><mi id="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.5.5.3" xref="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.5.5.3.cmml">S</mi><mo lspace="0em" rspace="0em" id="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.5.5.2" xref="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.5.5.2.cmml">​</mo><mi id="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.5.5.4" xref="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.5.5.4.cmml">m</mi><mo lspace="0em" rspace="0em" id="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.5.5.2a" xref="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.5.5.2.cmml">​</mo><msub id="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.5.5.5" xref="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.5.5.5.cmml"><mi id="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.5.5.5.2" xref="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.5.5.5.2.cmml">p</mi><mi id="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.5.5.5.3" xref="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.5.5.5.3.cmml">i</mi></msub><mo lspace="0em" rspace="0em" id="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.5.5.2b" xref="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.5.5.2.cmml">​</mo><mrow id="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.5.5.1.1" xref="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.5.5.1.1.1.cmml"><mo stretchy="false" id="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.5.5.1.1.2" xref="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.5.5.1.1.1.cmml">(</mo><mrow id="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.5.5.1.1.1" xref="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.5.5.1.1.1.cmml"><mi id="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.5.5.1.1.1.2" xref="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.5.5.1.1.1.2.cmml">i</mi><mo id="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.5.5.1.1.1.1" xref="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.5.5.1.1.1.1.cmml">=</mo><mrow id="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.5.5.1.1.1.3.2" xref="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.5.5.1.1.1.3.1.cmml"><mn id="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1" xref="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml">1</mn><mo id="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.5.5.1.1.1.3.2.1" xref="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.5.5.1.1.1.3.1.cmml">,</mo><mn id="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.2.2" xref="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.2.2.cmml">2</mn><mo id="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.5.5.1.1.1.3.2.2" xref="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.5.5.1.1.1.3.1.cmml">,</mo><mn id="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.3.3" xref="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.3.3.cmml">3</mn><mo id="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.5.5.1.1.1.3.2.3" xref="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.5.5.1.1.1.3.1.cmml">,</mo><mn id="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.4.4" xref="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.4.4.cmml">4</mn></mrow></mrow><mo stretchy="false" id="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.5.5.1.1.3" xref="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.5.5.1.1.1.cmml">)</mo></mrow></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.5b"><apply id="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.5.5.cmml" xref="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.5.5"><times id="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.5.5.2.cmml" xref="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.5.5.2"></times><ci id="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.5.5.3.cmml" xref="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.5.5.3">𝑆</ci><ci id="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.5.5.4.cmml" xref="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.5.5.4">𝑚</ci><apply id="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.5.5.5.cmml" xref="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.5.5.5"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.5.5.5.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.5.5.5">subscript</csymbol><ci id="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.5.5.5.2.cmml" xref="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.5.5.5.2">𝑝</ci><ci id="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.5.5.5.3.cmml" xref="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.5.5.5.3">𝑖</ci></apply><apply id="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.5.5.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.5.5.1.1"><eq id="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.5.5.1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.5.5.1.1.1.1"></eq><ci id="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.5.5.1.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.5.5.1.1.1.2">𝑖</ci><list id="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.5.5.1.1.1.3.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.5.5.1.1.1.3.2"><cn type="integer" id="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1">1</cn><cn type="integer" id="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.2.2.cmml" xref="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.2.2">2</cn><cn type="integer" id="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.3.3.cmml" xref="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.3.3">3</cn><cn type="integer" id="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.4.4.cmml" xref="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.4.4">4</cn></list></apply></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.5c">Smp_{i}(i=1,2,3,4)</annotation></semantics></math>.</p>

<p id="S4.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">To facilitate the testing of the proposed positive feedback method, we implemented the following steps. Firstly, we generated prediction maps of a multi-branch model using the model disclosed by the author and Python tools. Secondly, we evaluated the positive feedback method using Matlab tools.</p>
</div>
<div id="S4.SS2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">To evaluate the effectiveness and characteristics of our proposed method, we conducted comparative, ablation, and robustness experiments. In the comparative experiment, we compared the performance with other state-of-the arts models. Results showed that the positive feedback mechanism improved the model’s performance on multiple metrics. In the ablation experiment, we compared the performance of the positive feedback mechanism with pixel-level addition fusion on five datasets. In the robustness experiment, we manually selected good and bad renderings from each model and input them into the positive feedback mechanism to observe the visual comparison results.</p>

<p id="S4.SS4.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Based on the results of the two sets of comparative experiments on ablation, we can derive several professional conclusions. Firstly, in cases where there is a significant difference in performance between the selected methods and their placement in a multi-branch structure, the proposed method exhibits greater advantages over direct fusion. Conversely, when the performance difference between the selected methods is minor, the proposed method can only exhibit limited superiority over direct fusion. Additionally, it is important to note that the performance synthesis level achieved through positive feedback fusion is consistently superior to that of each individual model within a multi-branch structure.</p>

<div id="S4.SS5.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">To assess the proposed method’s robustness against interference, we conducted adversarial experiments on a four-branch structure. Despite the outstanding detection performance of many existing methods, their capabilities are not consistently strong, as depicted in Figure <a href="#S4.F4" title="Figure 4 ‣ 4.5 Robustness experiment ‣ 4 Experimental results and analysis ‣ A positive feedback method based on F-measure value for Salient Object Detection" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a>. To better showcase the superiority of our approach, we manually selected several sets of input predictions with both desirable and undesirable effects for the proposed method, and presented visual comparisons in Figure <a href="#S4.F4" title="Figure 4 ‣ 4.5 Robustness experiment ‣ 4 Experimental results and analysis ‣ A positive feedback method based on F-measure value for Salient Object Detection" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a>. This not only explains why the proposed method is superior to methods introduced into a multi-branch structure, but also superior to direct fusion, as it allows for automatic weight updating to achieve satisfactory results, instead of treating all branches equally. Furthermore, it should be noted that even in the absence of good predictions in the four-branch structural model, a favorable outcome may still be yielded, as demonstrated in the seventh row.</p>

<h2 class="ltx_title ltx_title_section">Conclusion</h2>

<div id="Sx1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Distinguished from most existing efforts in salient object detection (SOD), this study focuses on enhancing the accuracy of previously established algorithms. Specifically, we introduce a positive feedback approach based F-measure value for SOD that comprises a multi-branch model structure and a positive feedback prediction structure. The method involves feeding input images into the multi-branch model structure to generate their corresponding saliency maps, and then processing these maps through the positive feedback prediction structure for obtaining the final result via positive feedback calculation. Notably, our method requires no model training, entails minimal hyperparameter tuning, and features automatic calculation. By integrating multiple existing models, our method surpasses the performance of individual models. Our proposed method achieves a prediction speed of 20 frames per second (FPS) even on a low-end host, while removing the prediction time overhead of inserted models. Our findings suggest that higher performance of the inserted models leads to better overall results, and the initialization stage is crucial due to the positive feedback mechanism. Selecting models with insignificant performance differences weakly showcases the advantages of our approach. We believe that our study is not only of significant research value but also has practical applications, and thus, merits the attention and scrutiny of future researchers.</p>
