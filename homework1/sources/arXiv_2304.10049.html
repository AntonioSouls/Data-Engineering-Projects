<h6 class="ltx_title ltx_title_abstract">Abstract</h6>
<p id="id20.id1" class="ltx_p">Real-time detection of moving objects is an essential capability for robots acting autonomously in dynamic environments.
We thus propose <em id="id20.id1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">Dynablox</em>, a novel online mapping-based approach for robust moving object detection in complex unstructured environments.
The central idea of our approach is to incrementally estimate high confidence free-space areas by modeling and accounting for sensing, state estimation, and mapping limitations during online robot operation.
The spatio-temporally conservative free space estimate enables robust detection of moving objects without making any assumptions on the appearance of objects or environments.
This allows deployment in complex scenes such as multi-storied buildings or staircases, and for diverse moving objects such as people carrying various items, doors swinging or even balls rolling around.
We thoroughly evaluate our approach on real-world data sets, achieving 86% IoU at 17 FPS in typical robotic settings.
The method outperforms a recent appearance-based classifier and approaches the performance of offline methods.
We demonstrate its generality on a novel data set with rare moving objects in complex environments.
We make our efficient implementation and the novel data set available as open-source.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">As the capabilities of mobile robots are advancing beyond controlled environments to diverse tasks such as inspection, security, or logistics in complex dynamic environments, the need to reliably detect a variety of moving objects such as people, vehicles, and other robots is of utmost importance for safe robot operation.
This is a challenging problem for several reasons.
In many cases, autonomous robots have to act in new or rapidly changing environments.
They thus must detect moving objects online and on-board instead of relying on an existing map.
In addition, real-world workplaces and public spaces come with multiple challenges in that they do not exhibit strong structure such as flat streets or marked pedestrian crossings.
Instead there is large variety in environment structure, such as tunnels in mines to shopping malls with open floor plans in multiple levels, stairs, or ramps, as well as in the type of moving objects encountered, such as children playing ball, pets, or people carrying objects.
However, most work on online moving object detection make heavy use of appearance-based cues, either engineered for a particular type of environment, or trained offline using labeled examples.
This makes them vulnerable to failing on uncommon objects or non-planar environments such as in Fig. <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ I Introduction ‣ Dynablox: Real-time Detection of Diverse Dynamic Objects in Complex Environments" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>.</p>

<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">To enable robust moving object detection over heterogeneous unstructured environments and objects, we here instead propose an online mapping-based approach that is agnostic to appearance by extracting motion cues from state-of-the-art solutions for volumetric mapping.
Our approach is based on the insight that to robustly detect moving objects using a map, we need a robust notion of free space.
However, this is particularly challenging when the map is constructed online, as errors arise not only from sensor noise, but also state drift, map uncertainty at the boundaries of unexplored space, as well as sparse returns at range.
We detail in turn how to overcome these issues to estimate the set of voxels that are free with high confidence.
These are then used to recover all moving points, and update the map accordingly.
Our method thus does not require advance knowledge of the type of environment or moving object that the robot will encounter.
Second, it adds little computational overhead over a conventional mapping stack required for autonomous navigation in such environments, allowing it to run online and in real-time on-board a laptop-grade CPU.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">While the method is general, in this work we focus on robots equipped with a LiDAR sensor.
LiDAR has emerged as a reliable choice for mapping complex unknown environments in challenging conditions, with teams in the recent DARPA Subterannean Challenge relying heavily on it <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>.
As there is still a lack of open-source solutions for 3D moving object detection in unstructured environments, we make our implementation available as a layer running on top of the popular mapping framework Voxblox <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>, which was also used by the DARPA SubT winning team<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>.</p>

<div id="S2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We here categorize related work based on their primary method of segmenting moving objects in point clouds: appearance-based segmentation of each point cloud, scan-to-scan change detection against the previous points, or map-based change detection by comparing the point cloud against a map.
Several works make use of more than one method.
Contrary to our focus on autonomous robots in unstructured cluttered environments, most recent work focus on autonomous driving settings.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The spatial appearance of dynamic objects can be used for detection from only one point cloud.
This is object- or environment-specific, either via a model <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>, or via training on labeled examples in advance.
A subtle but common appearance-based assumption is filtering out the ground <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>.
However, while streets and floors are mostly flat, this does not hold in many robotic applications.
Many recent works focus on learning semantic segmentation of point clouds <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>, most focusing on autonomous driving and using SemanticKITTI <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>.
However, a major limitation of appearance-based methods is that robots oftentimes have to operate in open-set environments, where previously unknown objects may be encountered.
Instead, we develop an approach to detect diverse moving objects in complex scenes.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">It is also possible to segment moving objects from residuals in point cloud registration or scene flow.
Such approaches are agnostic of object type, but they are typically computationally expensive and struggle with slow-moving objects or articulated objects with separately moving parts, like pedestrians.
Dewan <span id="S2.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><span id="S2.p3.1.1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_upright">[</span><a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a><span id="S2.p3.1.1.2.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_upright">]</span></cite></span> sequentially estimate multiple rigid motion hypotheses using RANSAC on point cloud registration.
This has also been combined with learning appearance in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>.
State-of-the-art learning-based approaches for autonomous driving also include scan-to-scan depth residuals to improve an appearance-based approach <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>.
However, learning based on appearance loses the object agnosticity of pure scan-to-scan approaches. By contrast, 4DMOS <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite> recently proposed to train entirely on a sequence of point clouds to make it less dependent on object appearance.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Map-based approaches typically require an existing map for detection.
If an environment is already fully mapped, background subtraction can be used to aid recovery of moving objects <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>.
Recent map-based approaches <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite> focus on generating labels for appearance-based classifiers offline.
However, these are far too slow to run online and exploit that they have both past and future data on the scene.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Similarly, map cleaning approaches attempt to remove dynamic objects offline to compute accurate static maps of the environment <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>.
While related, maps are typically dense enough even with considerable spurious removals, which means their metrics focus on static points and the approaches not directly comparable.
These can make use of very approximate free-space calculations <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>, <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>, and recently, online cleaning of submaps was shown <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>, but it only needed to clean when a submap of multiple point clouds was integrated rather than at sensor rates.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p6.1" class="ltx_p">Most closely to ours, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite> build an occupancy grid online, detecting points in free space as moving and cluster them into objects that are tracked through time.
However it only uses 2D range finder scans which may not work well in 3D.
In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite> an octree structure is used online to detect moving objects on streets but they note their approach works poorly on pedestrians and provide no quantitative results.</p>

<p id="S4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">To achieve this goal, we exploit the motion cue that when a point falls into space that is known to be free, the point must have moved there and thus be dynamic.
However, knowing which spaces are truly free during online robot operation is a challenging problem.
Primary limitations include that the sensor readings may be sparse, the measured points noisy, the state estimate drifting from imperfect localization, and the reconstructed map inaccurate as observations are limited.
If space is wrongly classified as free, it will continuously detect static parts as moving.
If the detection is too conservative, the robot may fail to detect dynamic objects in time and jeopardize safety.
To overcome these limitations, the central idea of our approach is to incrementally estimate a reduced but high confidence free space area by modeling each of these limitations.
These high confidence areas are then used to seed dynamic object clusters and disambiguate points in low-confidence areas.
As autonomous robots oftentimes have to build a map for navigation, we leverage this fact to present a light-weight implementation of our approach with minimal compute overhead over Voxblox <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>, a widely used mapping framework.
An overview of our pipeline is shown in Fig. <a href="#S4.F2" title="Figure 2 ‣ IV-A Map Representation ‣ IV Approach ‣ Dynablox: Real-time Detection of Diverse Dynamic Objects in Complex Environments" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>, and each component is further detailed below.</p>

<p id="S4.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">A central component in mapping-based motion detection is the map representation.
In this work, we choose to adapt and extend Voxblox <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>, as this has two major advantages:
First, the map required for safe navigation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite> can directly be used for online motion detection, thus incurring little additional computation costs.
Second, we make extensive use of its hierarchical spatial hash-block structure for efficient real-time computation.
Nonetheless, other map representations are admissible to our approach.
This section briefly summarizes the relevant parts and presents our extensions of the map.</p>

On one hand, this is important as free voxels turning occupied is the major motion cue exploited in this work.
On the other hand, this is problematic when the robot state estimate is not perfect.</p>

As drift may occur over time, large parts of the static observations now fall into previously free space and are wrongly detected.
A central challenge in compensating drift is that both drift and dynamic objects are perceived as motion within the sensor frame.
However, a distinguishing feature is the velocity at which things move, as drift is typically characterized by slowly accumulating tracking errors.
To compensate for this, we allow voxels to turn occupied when the observed motion is slow and the voxels are located in the low-confidence free-space area, thus modifying (<a href="#S4.E11" title="In IV-C High-confidence Free-space Estimation ‣ IV Approach ‣ Dynablox: Real-time Detection of Diverse Dynamic Objects in Complex Environments" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">11</span></a>) to:</p>

<p id="S7.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">We observe in Tab. <a href="#S7.T1" title="TABLE I ‣ VII Evaluation ‣ Dynablox: Real-time Detection of Diverse Dynamic Objects in Complex Environments" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">I</span></a> that our method shows strong performance even on the full-range data, outperforming the learning-based methods and approaching the hindsight offline method.
We note that this is a particularly challenging domain for several reasons.
First, DOALS-3DMiniNet has been trained on the other environments of the DOALS dataset and learnt to identify pedestrians, which make up the vast majority of dynamic objects.
It achieves best performance among the learning-based methods.
<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite> are pre-trained on KITTI <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>, as no labeled training data for DOALS is available.
While 4DMOS, which similar to ours emphasizes spatial motion cues, transfers to some degree to the new dataset, the more appearance-based methods LMNet (Original) and MotionSeg3D achieve low performance.
To reduce this domain gap, we further refit the model statistics of LMNet and MotonSeg3D on the DOALS data (labeled <em id="S7.SS1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">Refit</em>).
While this improves performance, it is important to point out that this is model fitting on the evaluation data, and performance is still substantially lower than ours.
We did not achieve meaningful results for MotionSeg3D even with refitting.
This suggests that, while these methods show strong performance in their original domain, they can be hard to generalize to out-of-domain data sets without significant retraining.

In contast, our approach is completely prior-free and object class agnostic.
This is also reflected in the lower variance across sequences.
Second, the density of the LiDAR scan and therewith also quality of the map notably decreases with higher distances.

Nonetheless, our high IoU on full range highlights the applicability of our method to long-range detection scenarios.
Lastly, we observe that using the conventional free-space <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite> results in significantly reduced performance, reinforcing the importance of our high-confidence map.</p>

<p id="S7.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">To evaluate the capacity of our approach to detect diverse moving objects in challenging environments, we show qualitative detection results of our recorded sequences in Fig. <a href="#S7.F3" title="Figure 3 ‣ VII Evaluation ‣ Dynablox: Real-time Detection of Diverse Dynamic Objects in Complex Environments" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a>.
A large advantage of our proposed method is that, since it is purely geometric, it is completely agnostic to the class of moving object.
This stands in stark contrast to most current learning-based approaches that are oftentimes pre-trained on specific objects such as pedestrians <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>, which may not generalize well to the open-set world encountered by robots.
We observe that our method correctly detects numerous pedestrians, also with unusual appearances, e.g. when carrying boxes, rolling cases, or even surfboards.
We further successfully detect radically different objects such as balls rolling around or swinging doors.
In addition, we observe that our method is applicable to various challenging and unstructured scenes, where assumptions about the environment such as the existence of a ground plane may not hold.
Notably, due our conservative estimate, also challenging geometry is correctly classified as static.</p>

While each modeled effect contributes to the overall performance, we observe a clear split between aspects central to the method that lead to stark performance drops, and minor effects that only polish the final performance.
In terms of mapping cues (<a href="#S4.E8" title="In IV-C High-confidence Free-space Estimation ‣ IV Approach ‣ Dynablox: Real-time Detection of Diverse Dynamic Objects in Complex Environments" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">8</span></a>), we observe that fusion of measurements in the TSDF map is an essential component for robust detection, whereas the up-to-date occupancy cues make only a minor difference.
This may be explained by the fact that we update the TSDF to be up-to-date in dynamic regions, and by the comparably slow motions of pedestrians in the dataset which are already well captured in the TSDF.
We find that being conservative in classifying space as free, both temporally (<math id="S7.SS5.p1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\tau_{w}" display="inline"><semantics id="S7.SS5.p1.1.m1.1a"><msub id="S7.SS5.p1.1.m1.1.1" xref="S7.SS5.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml"><mi id="S7.SS5.p1.1.m1.1.1.2" xref="S7.SS5.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml">τ</mi><mi id="S7.SS5.p1.1.m1.1.1.3" xref="S7.SS5.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml">w</mi></msub><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S7.SS5.p1.1.m1.1b"><apply id="S7.SS5.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S7.SS5.p1.1.m1.1.1"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S7.SS5.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S7.SS5.p1.1.m1.1.1">subscript</csymbol><ci id="S7.SS5.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S7.SS5.p1.1.m1.1.1.2">𝜏</ci><ci id="S7.SS5.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S7.SS5.p1.1.m1.1.1.3">𝑤</ci></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S7.SS5.p1.1.m1.1c">\tau_{w}</annotation></semantics></math>) and spatially (<math id="S7.SS5.p1.2.m2.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\mathcal{N}" display="inline"><semantics id="S7.SS5.p1.2.m2.1a"><mi class="ltx_font_mathcaligraphic" id="S7.SS5.p1.2.m2.1.1" xref="S7.SS5.p1.2.m2.1.1.cmml">𝒩</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S7.SS5.p1.2.m2.1b"><ci id="S7.SS5.p1.2.m2.1.1.cmml" xref="S7.SS5.p1.2.m2.1.1">𝒩</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S7.SS5.p1.2.m2.1c">\mathcal{N}</annotation></semantics></math>) is crucial, as getting wrong labels once lead to numerous false positives in the future.
For this reason, we note that erasing the spatial or temporal confidence leads to even worse performance than directly querying the TSDF map (Tab. <a href="#S7.T1" title="TABLE I ‣ VII Evaluation ‣ Dynablox: Real-time Detection of Diverse Dynamic Objects in Complex Environments" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">I</span></a>), whereas combining both almost triples performance.

This corroborates our assumptions that the volumetric map can be a powerful tool to detect moving objects, if free space is modeled with high confidence.</p>

Extremely thin and sparsely measured objects such as a shade are hard to represent in the voxel-based map.
This issue could be alleviated by e.g. using neural map representations <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite> that can achieve high resolution to model thin objects.
Reflective surfaces such as windows are known to be problematic for LiDAR and can also lead to erroneous detection.
As this is primarily a sensor limitation, this issue is hard to address from a mapping perspective.
Lastly, the approach relies on dense mapping of the scene, which requires sufficiently high data rates for the sensor speed. Similarly, strong occlusions may impede complete mapping of new areas and thus lead to only partial detection at new map boundaries.</p>

<p id="S8.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We presented <em id="S8.p1.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">Dynablox</em>, a novel online mapping-based approach for real-time moving object detection in complex dynamic environments. Benchmarks on real-world data achieve 86% IoU at 17 FPS in typical robotic settings.
The method outperforms a recent appearance-based classifier without making any assumptions on object or environment, and approaches the performance of a recent offline approach with hindsight knowledge.
We also qualitatively validated this generalization on a new custom data set with rare objects in challenging scenes.
Our experimental analysis of the computational scaling matched theoretical predictions, allowing real-time operation in typical indoor environments and adding only a 39% overhead to a conventional volumetric mapping stack.
We additionally provide an easy formula for optimizing the method to the expected level of drift and validated this in a series of experiments. Finally, our implementation and data are released open-source to aid future research in the area.</p>
