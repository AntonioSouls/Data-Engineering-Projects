<p id="id12.id1" class="ltx_p">Although no specific domain knowledge is considered in the design, plain vision transformers have shown excellent performance in visual recognition tasks. However, little effort has been made to reveal the potential of such simple structures for pose estimation tasks. In this paper, we show the surprisingly good capabilities of plain vision transformers for pose estimation from various aspects, namely simplicity in model structure, scalability in model size, flexibility in training paradigm, and transferability of knowledge between models, through a simple baseline model called <span id="id12.id1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">ViTPose</span>. Specifically, ViTPose employs plain and non-hierarchical vision transformers as backbones to extract features for a given person instance and a lightweight decoder for pose estimation. It can be scaled up from 100M to 1B parameters by taking the advantages of the scalable model capacity and high parallelism of transformers, setting a new Pareto front between throughput and performance. Besides, ViTPose is very flexible regarding the attention type, input resolution, pre-training and finetuning strategy, as well as dealing with multiple pose tasks. We also empirically demonstrate that the knowledge of large ViTPose models can be easily transferred to small ones via a simple knowledge token. Experimental results show that our basic ViTPose model outperforms representative methods on the challenging MS COCO Keypoint Detection benchmark, while the largest model sets a new state-of-the-art, i.e., 80.9 AP on the MS COCO test-dev set.

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Human pose estimation is one of the fundamental tasks in computer vision and has a wide range of real-world applications <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib51" title="" class="ltx_ref">51</a>, <a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite>. It aims to localize human anatomical keypoints and is challenging due to the variations of occlusion, truncation, scales, and human appearances. To deal with these issues, there has been rapid progress in deep learning-based methods <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>, <a href="#bib.bib42" title="" class="ltx_ref">42</a>, <a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>, <a href="#bib.bib50" title="" class="ltx_ref">50</a>]</cite>, which typically tackle the challenging task using convolutional neural networks.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Recently, vision transformers <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>, <a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite> have shown great potential in many vision tasks. Inspired by their success, different vision transformer structures have been deployed for the pose estimation task. Most of them adopt a CNN as a backbone and then use a transformer of elaborate structures to refine the extracted features and model the relationship between the body keypoints. For example, PRTR <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite> incorporates both transformer encoders and decoders to gradually refine the locations of the estimated keypoints in a cascade manner. TokenPose <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite> and TransPose <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib44" title="" class="ltx_ref">44</a>]</cite>, instead, adopt an encoder-only transformer structure to process the features extracted by CNNs. On the other hand, HRFormer <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib48" title="" class="ltx_ref">48</a>]</cite> employs the transformer to directly extract features and introduce high-resolution representations via multi-resolution parallel transformer modules. These methods have obtained superior performance on pose estimation tasks. However, they either need extra CNNs for feature extraction or require careful designs of the transformer structure to adapt to the task. This motivates us to think from an opposite direction, <span id="S1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">how well can the plain vision transformer do for pose estimation?</span></p>

<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">To find the answer to this question, we propose a simple baseline model called <span id="S1.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">ViTPose</span> and demonstrate its potential on the MS COCO Keypoint dataset <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite>. Specifically, ViTPose employs plain and non-hierarchical vision transformers <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite> as backbones to extract feature maps for the given person instances, where the backbones are pre-trained with masked image modeling pretext tasks, <em id="S1.p3.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">e.g</em>., MAE <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>, to provide a good initialization. Then, a following lightweight decoder processes the extracted features by upsampling the feature maps and regressing the heatmaps w.r.t. the keypoints, which is composed of two deconvolution layers and one prediction layer. Despite no elaborate designs in the model, ViTPose obtains state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance of 80.9 AP on the challenging MS COCO Keypoint test-dev set. It should be noted that this paper does not claim the algorithmic superiority but rather presents a simple and solid transformer baseline with superior performance for pose estimation.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Besides the superior performance, we also show the surprisingly good capabilities of ViTPose from various aspects, namely simplicity, scalability, flexibility, and transferability. 1) For simplicity, thanks to vision transformers’ strong feature representation ability, the ViTPose framework can be extremely simple. For example, it does not require any specific domain knowledge for the design of the backbone encoder and enjoys a plain and non-hierarchical encoder structure by simply stacking several transformer layers. The decoder can be further simplified to a single up-sampling layer followed by a convolutional prediction layer with a negligible performance drop. Such a structural simplicity makes ViTPose enjoy better parallelism so that it reaches a new Pareto front in terms of the inference speed and performance, as shown in Fig. <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ ViTPose: Simple Vision Transformer Baselines for Human Pose Estimation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>. 2) In addition, the simplicity in structure brings the excellent scalability properties of ViTPose. Thus it benefits from the rapid development of scalable pre-trained vision transformers. Specifically, one can easily control the model size by stacking different numbers of transformer layers and increasing or decreasing the feature dimensions, <em id="S1.p4.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">e.g</em>., using ViT-B, ViT-L, or ViT-H, to balance the inference speed and performance for various deployment requirements. 3) Furthermore, we demonstrate that ViTPose is very flexible in the training paradigm. ViTPose can adapt well to different input resolutions and feature resolutions with minor modifications and can invariably deliver more accurate pose estimation results for higher resolution inputs.
Apart from training the ViTPose on a single pose dataset as the common practice, we can modify it to adapt to multiple pose datasets by adding extra decoders very flexibly, resulting in a joint training pipeline and bringing significant performance improvement. This training paradigm brings only marginal (extra) computational cost since the decoder in ViTPose is rather lightweight. In addition, ViTPose can still obtain SOTA performance when pre-trained using smaller unlabelled datasets or finetuned with the attention modules frozen, requiring less training cost than a fully pre-trained finetuning paradigm. 4) Last but not least, the performance of small ViTPose models can be easily improved by transferring the knowledge from large ViTPose models through an extra learnable knowledge token, demonstrating a good transferability of ViTPose.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">In conclusion, the contribution of this paper is threefold. 1) We propose a simple yet effective baseline model named ViTPose for human pose estimation. It obtains SOTA performance on the MS COCO Keypoint dataset even without the usage of elaborate structural designs or complex frameworks.
2) The simple ViTPose model demonstrates to have surprisingly good capabilities, including structural simplicity, model size scalability, training paradigm flexibility, and knowledge transferability. These capabilities build a strong baseline for vision transformer-based pose estimation tasks and would possibly shed light on further development in the field.
3) Comprehensive experiments on popular benchmarks are conducted to study and analyze the capabilities of ViTPose. With a very big vision transformer model as the backbone, <em id="S1.p5.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">i.e</em>., ViTAE-G <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib52" title="" class="ltx_ref">52</a>]</cite>, a single ViTPose model obtains the best 80.9 AP on the MS COCO Keypoint test-dev set.</p>

TokenPose <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite> proposes token-based representations by introducing extra tokens to estimate the locations of occluded keypoints and model the relationship among different keypoints. To get rid of the CNNs for feature extraction, HRFormer <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib48" title="" class="ltx_ref">48</a>]</cite> is proposed to use transformers to extract high-resolution features directly. A delicate parallel transformer module is proposed to fuse multi-resolution features in HRFormer gradually. These transformer-based pose estimation methods obtain superior performance on popular keypoint estimation benchmarks. However, they either need CNNs for feature extraction or require careful designs of the transformer structures. There have been little efforts in exploring the potential of plain vision transformers for the pose estimation tasks. In this paper, we fill this gap by proposing a simple yet effective baseline model, ViTPose, based on the plain vision transformers.</p>

However, it requires extra data beyond the pose ones, which makes the data requirement higher for the pose estimation task. It comes to us whether we can use only the pose data during the whole training phase to relax the data requirement. To explore the data flexibility, apart from the default settings of ImageNet <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite> pre-training, we use MAE <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite> to pre-train the backbones with MS COCO <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite> and a combination of MS COCO and AI Challenger <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib41" title="" class="ltx_ref">41</a>]</cite> respectively by random masking 75% patches from the images and reconstructing those masked patches. Then, we use the pre-trained weights to initialize the backbones of ViTPose and finetune the model on the MS COCO dataset. Surprisingly, although the volume of the pose data is much smaller than ImageNet, ViTPose trained with pose data only can obtain competitive performance, implying that ViTPose can learn a good initialization flexibly from data of different scales.</p>

Besides, to adapt the model to lower downsampling ratios, <em id="S3.SS3.p2.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">i.e</em>., higher feature resolutions, we simply change the stride of the patch embedding layer to partition tokens with overlap and retain the size of each patch.

However, simply using window-based attention for all transformer blocks degrades the performance due to the lack of global context modeling ability.

Specifically, we pool the tokens for each window to get the global context feature within the window. These features are then fed into each window to serve as key and value tokens to enable cross-window feature communication. Besides, we prove that the two strategies are complementary to each other and can work together to improve the performance and reduce memory footprint, without the need of extra parameters or modules but with simple modifications to the attention calculation.</p>

To investigate whether it still holds for vision transformers, we finetune ViTPose on MS COCO with all parameters unfrozen, MHSA modules frozen, and FFN modules frozen, respectively.

Since images in the ImageNet-1k dataset are iconic, we crop the person instances from the MS COCO and AI Challenger training set to form new training data for pre-training. The models are pre-trained for 1,600 epochs on the three datasets, respectively, and then finetuned on the MS COCO dataset with pose annotations for 210 epochs. The results are summarized in Table <a href="#S4.T3" title="Table 3 ‣ 4.2 Ablation study and analysis ‣ 4 Experiments ‣ ViTPose: Simple Vision Transformer Baselines for Human Pose Estimation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a>. It can be seen that with the combination of MS COCO and AI Challenger data for pre-training, ViTPose obtains comparable performance compared with using ImageNet-1k. It should be noted that the dataset volume is only half of the ImageNet-1k. It implies that pre-training on the data from downstream tasks has better data efficiency, validating ViTPose’s flexibility in using pre-training data. Nevertheless, the AP decreases by 1.3 if only MS COCO data are used for pre-training. It may be caused by the limited volume of the MS COCO dataset, <em id="S4.SS2.p2.1.3" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">i.e</em>., the number of instances in MS COCO is three times less than the combination of MS COCO and AI Challenger. Besides, without the cropping operations, <em id="S4.SS2.p2.1.4" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">i.e</em>., directly using the images from MS COCO and AI Challenger for pre-training, ViTPose still obtains comparable performance compared with using cropping operations. This observation further validates the conclusion that the data from downstream tasks themselves can bring better data efficiency in the pre-training stage.</p>

<p id="S4.SS2.p4.2" class="ltx_p"><span id="S4.SS2.p4.2.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">The influence of attention type.</span> As demonstrated in HRNet <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>]</cite> and HRFormer <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib48" title="" class="ltx_ref">48</a>]</cite>, high-resolution feature maps are beneficial for pose estimation tasks. ViTPose can easily generate high-resolution features by varying the downsampling ratio of the patching embedding layer, <em id="S4.SS2.p4.2.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">i.e</em>., from 1/16 to 1/8. Besides, to alleviate the out-of-memory issue caused by the quadratic computational complexity of transformer layers, window attention with shift and pooling mechanism can be used as described in Sec. <a href="#S3.SS3" title="3.3 The flexibility of ViTPose ‣ 3 ViTPose ‣ ViTPose: Simple Vision Transformer Baselines for Human Pose Estimation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3.3</span></a>. The results are presented in Table <a href="#S4.T5" title="Table 5 ‣ 4.2 Ablation study and analysis ‣ 4 Experiments ‣ ViTPose: Simple Vision Transformer Baselines for Human Pose Estimation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5</span></a>. ‘Shift’ and ‘Pool’ denote the shift window and pooling window mechanisms, respectively. Directly using full attention with 1/8 feature size obtains the best 77.4 AP on the MS COCO val set while suffering from a large memory footprint even under the mixed-precision training mode.

<p id="S4.SS2.p6.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S4.SS2.p6.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">The influence of multi-dataset training.</span> Since the decoder in ViTPose is rather simple and lightweight, we can easily extend ViTPose to a multi-dataset joint training paradigm by using a shared backbone and individual decoder for each dataset. Specifically, we use MS COCO <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite>, AI Challenger <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib41" title="" class="ltx_ref">41</a>]</cite>, and MPII <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite> datasets for multi-dataset training. The results on the MS COCO val set are listed in Table <a href="#S4.T7" title="Table 7 ‣ 4.2 Ablation study and analysis ‣ 4 Experiments ‣ ViTPose: Simple Vision Transformer Baselines for Human Pose Estimation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">7</span></a>. The results on other datasets are available in the supplementary. Note that we directly use the models after multi-dataset training for evaluation without finetuning them on MS COCO further. It can be observed that the performance of ViTPose increases consistently from 75.8 AP to 77.1 AP by using all three datasets for training. Although the volume of MPII is much smaller compared to the combination of MS COCO and AI Challenger (40K v.s. 500K), using MPII for training still brings a 0.1 AP increase, indicating that ViTPose can well harness the diverse data in different datasets.</p>

The results are available in Table <a href="#S4.T8" title="Table 8 ‣ 4.2 Ablation study and analysis ‣ 4 Experiments ‣ ViTPose: Simple Vision Transformer Baselines for Human Pose Estimation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">8</span></a>. As can be seen, the token-based distillation brings 0.2 AP gain for ViTPose-B with marginal extra memory footprint, while the output distillation brings a 0.5 AP increase. The two distillation methods are complementary to each other, and using them together obtains 76.6 AP, validating the excellent transferability of ViTPose models.</p>

The speed of all methods is recorded on a single A100 GPU with a batch size of 64. It can be observed that although the model size of ViTPose is large, it obtains a better trade-off between throughput and accuracy, showing that the plain vision transformer has strong representation ability and is friendly to modern hardware. Besides, ViTPose performs well with much larger backbones. For example, ViTPose-L obtains much better performance than ViTPose-B, <em id="S4.SS3.p1.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">i.e</em>., 78.3 AP v.s 75.8 AP and 83.5 AR v.s. 81.1 AR on the val set. ViTPose-L has outperformed previous SOTA CNN and transformer models, including UPD and TokenPose, with a similar inference speed. Similar conclusions can be drawn by comparing the performance of ViTPose-H (15th row) and HRFormer-B (9th row), where ViTPose-H obtains better performance and faster inference speed, <em id="S4.SS3.p1.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">i.e</em>., 79.1 AP v.s. 75.6 AP and 241 fps v.s. 158 fps, with only MS COCO data for training. Besides, compared with the HRFormer <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib48" title="" class="ltx_ref">48</a>]</cite>, ViTPose has faster inference speed since its structure contains only one branch and operates on relative smaller feature resolution, <em id="S4.SS3.p1.1.3" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">i.e</em>., 1/16 compared with 1/4 used in HRFormer. With multi-dataset training, the performance of ViTPose models further increases, implying the good scalability and flexibility of ViTPose. This observation also demonstrates that with proper training and data, the plain vision transformer itself can model the relationships between different keypoints well and encode features of good linear separability for pose estimation tasks.</p>

<div id="S6.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">This paper presents ViTPose as the simple baseline for vision transformer-based human pose estimation. It demonstrates simplicity, scalability, flexibility, and transferability for the pose estimation tasks, which have been well justified through extensive experiments on the MS COCO dataset. A single ViTPose model with a big backbone ViTAE-G obtains the best 80.9 AP on the MS COCO test-dev set. We hope this work could provide useful insights to the community and inspire further study on exploring the potential of plain vision transformers in more computer vision tasks.</p>

<p id="A1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">To evaluate the performance of ViTPose comprehensively, apart from the results on MS COCO val set, we also report the performance of ViTPose-B, ViTPose-L, ViTPose-H, and ViTPose-G on OCHuman <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib54" title="" class="ltx_ref">54</a>]</cite> val and test set, MPII <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite> val set, and AI Challenger <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib41" title="" class="ltx_ref">41</a>]</cite> val set, respectively. Please note that the ViTPose variants are trained under the multi-dataset training setting and tested directly without further finetuning on the specific training dataset, to keep the whole pipeline as simple as possible.</p>

<div id="A1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="A1.p2.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="A1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold ltx_font_italic">OCHuman val and test set.</span> To evaluate the performance of human pose estimation models on the human instances with heavy occlusion, we test the ViTPose variants and representative models on the OCHuman val and test set with ground truth bounding boxes. We do not adopt extra human detectors since not all human instances are annotated in the OCHuman datasets, where the human detector will cause a lot of “false positive” bounding boxes and can not reflect the true ability of pose estimation models. Specifically, the decoder head of ViTPose corresponding to the MS COCO dataset is used, as the keypoint definitions are the same in MS COCO and OCHuman datasets. The results are available in Table <a href="#A1.T11" title="Table 11 ‣ Appendix A Additional results of multi-dataset training ‣ ViTPose: Simple Vision Transformer Baselines for Human Pose Estimation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">11</span></a>. Compared with previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods with complex structures, <em id="A1.p2.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">e.g</em>., MIPNet <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>, ViTPose obtains over 10 AP increase on the OCHuman val set, although there is no special design to deal with occlusion in the network structure, implying the strong feature representation ability of ViTPose. It also should be noted that HRFormer <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib48" title="" class="ltx_ref">48</a>]</cite> experiences large performance drops from MS COCO to OCHuman, and the small model beats the base model, <em id="A1.p2.1.3" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">i.e</em>., 53.1 AP v.s 50.4 AP on the OCHuman val set. Such phenomena imply that HRFormer may overfit to the MS COCO dataset, especially for lager-scale models, and need an extra finetuning stage to transfer from MS COCO to OCHuman. Besides, ViTPose significantly pushes forward the frontier of keypoint detection performance on both val and test set, <em id="A1.p2.1.4" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">i.e</em>., obtaining about 93 AP. Such results demonstrate that ViTPose can flexibly deal with challenging cases with heavy occlusion and obtain SOTA performance.</p>

However, the precision is still not high enough on the AI Challenger set, indicating that more efforts need to be made to further improve the performance.</p>

MPII dataset is under the BSD license and contains 15K images and 22K human instances for training. There are at most 16 human keypoints for each instance annotated in this dataset. AI Challenger is much bigger and contains over 200K training images and 350 human instances, with at most 14 keypoints for each instance annotated. OCHuman contains human instances with heavy occlusion and is just used for val and test set, which includes 4K images and 8K instances.</p>
