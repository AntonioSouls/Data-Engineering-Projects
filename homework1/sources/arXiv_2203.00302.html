<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">Estimating 6D object pose from an RGB image is important for many real-world applications such as autonomous driving and robotic grasping. Recent deep learning models have achieved significant progress on this task but their robustness received little research attention. In this work, for the first time, we study adversarial samples that can fool deep learning models with imperceptible perturbations to input image. In particular, we propose a Unified 6D pose estimation Attack, namely U6DA, which can successfully attack several state-of-the-art (SOTA) deep learning models for 6D pose estimation. The key idea of our U6DA is to fool the models to predict wrong results for object instance localization and shape that are essential for correct 6D pose estimation. Specifically, we explore a transfer-based black-box attack to 6D pose estimation. We design the U6DA loss to guide the generation of adversarial examples, the loss aims to shift the segmentation attention map away from its original position. We show that the generated adversarial samples are not only effective for direct 6D pose estimation models, but also are able to attack two-stage models regardless of their robust RANSAC modules. Extensive experiments were conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness, transferability, and anti-defense capability of our U6DA on large-scale public benchmarks. We also introduce a new U6DA-Linemod dataset for robustness study of the 6D pose estimation task.

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Understanding object pose in the three-dimensional world is an important research topic in computer vision. In the past decade, extensive research efforts have been made and achieved significant progress. In particular, recent deep learning based methods show that even using only a single RGB image without any additional depth data, 6D object pose can be predicted with high accuracy on large-scale public benchmarks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>, <a href="#bib.bib44" title="" class="ltx_ref">44</a>, <a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite>. Such monocular 6D object pose estimation models shed light on the possibility of single-RGB sensor based solutions for various 3D applications such as augmented reality <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib47" title="" class="ltx_ref">47</a>]</cite>, autonomous driving <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>, <a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite> and robotic grasping <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib43" title="" class="ltx_ref">43</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib41" title="" class="ltx_ref">41</a>]</cite>. In these real-world scenarios, model robustness is a crucial issue to consider. In some recent research, deep learning models are found to be vulnerable to adversarial samples <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite> in 2D image classification task. The adversarial samples contain human imperceptible perturbations to the input and can result wrong model prediction. Does such problem apply to other tasks? Inspired by such concerns, to the best of our knowledge, this work for the first time studies adversarial samples for the monocular 6D object pose estimation task. To mention, our discussion is focused on instance-level 6D object pose estimation with known object 3D models. Some other works study category-level object pose estimation for unseen objects, which are beyond the scope of this paper’s discussion.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Following the conventions in literature, SOTA deep learning methods for 6D object pose estimation can be roughly divided into three classes: direct methods, key-point based methods and dense coordinate based methods. The latter two classes follow two-stage scheme. The direct methods  <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib44" title="" class="ltx_ref">44</a>, <a href="#bib.bib46" title="" class="ltx_ref">46</a>]</cite> directly output pose parameters from the input RGB image. With two-stage scheme, the key-point based methods <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite> use DNN models to detect 2D keypoints in the image first, and then solve a RANSAC-based Perspective-n-Point (PnP) problem <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite> for 6D pose estimation. The dense coordinate based methods <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite> use DNNs to build dense 2D-3D correspondences, and then estimate 6D pose by solve RANSAC-based PnP problem. Recent research results on public benchmark show that all the top-performing algorithms follow the two stage scheme. It’s noticeable that the two-stage schemes include RANSAC-based PnP that are known to be robust to noise. Meanwhile, the un-differentiable part of RANSAC-based PnP makes it impossible to implement white-box attack <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>. These features indicate that a direct application of straight-forward adversarial attack methods may not work for these models.</p>

Column one shows a clean image and its adversarial image crafted by our U6DA. They are input to three deep learning models  <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>, <a href="#bib.bib44" title="" class="ltx_ref">44</a>, <a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite> of different methodologies, and their estimated poses for an object instance (driller in LINEMOD dataset) are shown in column 2-4. In each image, green and blue box denote ground truth and the predicted pose respectively. All the three deep models predict wrong poses with the adversarial image, which shows our U6DA attack is successful.</span></figcaption>
</figure>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Based on an observation that all the three classes of methods rely on object instance localization and shape, we infer that the adversarial samples crafted by attacking a segmentation task could be likely to transfer to 6D pose estimation task. To this end, we propose a Unified 6D pose estimation Attack, namely U6DA, which can successfully attack all the three classes of deep learning models for 6D pose estimation. Specifically, we explore a transfer-based black-box attack to 6D pose estimation, and we select the segmentation model as surrogate model. We design the U6DA loss to guide the generation of adversarial examples, the loss aims to shift the segmentation attention map away from its original position.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">We perform extensive experimental evaluations on the proposed U6DA on both the Linemod <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite> and Linemod Occlusion <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite> dataset.
Compared to two straight forward task-transfer attack methods <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>
, we show that our U6DA is much more effective to 6D pose estimation attack.
We also show the transferability of our U6DA attack. The adversarial samples generated by our U6DA can significantly decrease the ADD metric of all three mainstream RGB-based 6D pose estimation networks. In addition, we make two extension studies. We first examine whether the SOTA physically-based rendering <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite> (PBR) training is more robust than normal training. Our experimental results show that the PBR training is not as robust as normal training. Second, we demonstrate that the RGB-D based 6D pose estimation networks are more robust to RGB adversary. We also perform experiments to test classical adversarial defense algorithms and show that they are less effective on our U6DA. Finally, we introduce a new U6DA-Linemod dataset for robustness test of 6D pose estimation task, which we hope will benefit the 6D pose estimation community.

<p id="S2.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Adversarial attack <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite> refers to the process of applying a slight perturbation to the original input of deep learning model to generate adversarial samples that fool the target model (also known as the victim model). Adversarial attack methods have been extensively studied in the image classification task <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib44" title="" class="ltx_ref">44</a>]</cite>. Most of them are in the white-box setting, where full-knowledge of the DNN is known by the attacker. However, white-box attacks are not practical for many real applications where the attacker only knows the output of networks. Therefore, the black-box attacks where the attacker has no prior knowledge or only partial knowledge of the model are getting more research attentions. Recently, there are also some works focus on 3D point clouds <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite> and 3D meshes <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib48" title="" class="ltx_ref">48</a>]</cite>.
However, to the best of our knowledge, there is no adversarial attack to the 6D pose estimation task. In this paper, we make discussions to explore the black-box attack to 6D pose estimation task.</p>

<p id="S2.SS2.SSS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">These methods directly forecast the 6D object pose from input image, which treat the 6D pose estimation as a regression or classification task. Xiang et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib46" title="" class="ltx_ref">46</a>]</cite> propose PoseCNN, a novel end-to-end 6D pose estimation model, which decouples 6D pose estimation task into several different components. For the translation branch, it firstly localizes the object center in the image and estimates the depth with respect to the camera. Then the translation is recovered according to the projection equation. The rotation is regressed a quaternion representation directly. Instead of regressing rotation directly, SSD-6D <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite> treats rotation estimation as a classification problem via broken down the rotation space into classifiable ranges.

at mapping the Perspective-n-Point <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite> (PnP) algorithm using DNNs. For instance, the
GDRNet <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib44" title="" class="ltx_ref">44</a>]</cite> predicts the 6D pose via a Patch-PnP solver that is built upon DNNs. However, the DNNs are known to be vulnerable to adversarial attacks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>, it would be interesting to explore whether the direct methods are robust to adversarial samples.</p>

Linemod Occlusion <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite> is a variant of Linemod that makes up for Linemod that it lacks occlusion cases.

<p id="S3.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The overall framework of our Unified 6D Pose Estimation Attack (U6DA) is shown in Algorithm <a href="#alg1" title="Algorithm 1 ‣ 3.2 Unified 6D Pose Estimation Attack ‣ 3 Methodology ‣ Adversarial samples for deep monocular 6D object pose estimation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>. The U6DA generates adversarial examples via a pretrained segmentation network. The intuition of our U6DA is simple, since the deep 6D pose estimation networks heavily rely on the semantic segmentation information of the target instance to localize the object, we infer that an attack on the segmentation network could transfer to the deep 6D pose estimation network. Therefore, we use the classical segmentation network UNet <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>]</cite> as our surrogate model.</p>

<p id="S3.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">To pursue high transferability of U6DA to three mainstream deep 6D pose estimation networks, we need to find common features of those networks. Inspired by <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite> and the analysis in the previous section, we firstly select deep segmentation networks to learn the general features. Moreover, we attack on the attention map to avoid overfitting in the segmentation task and fool the models to predict wrong results for object shapes that are essential for correct 6D pose estimation. Specifically, we design the U6DA loss to guide the generation of adversarial examples, the loss aims to shift the segmentation attention map away from its original position. The key idea of our U6DA is if we shift the general features away from their original position, the following RANSAC-based PnP solver would make wrong estimation.</p>

<p id="S4.SS2.SSS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In our U6DA attack, we shift the attention map away from its original position and this leads to error in the RANSAC-based PnP solver. In this section, we explore the effect of different shift position on U6DA. In Linemode dataset, the image size is 640 pixels in width and 480 pixels in height, and most objects are located at image center. We therefore firstly perform a shift in the up and down direction of height with the maximum shift distance as half of the height (R test), and then perform shift in the left and right direction of width with the maximum shift distance as half of the width (C test). Lastly, we perform shift in both width and height (RC test). For R test, we first randomly select the up or down direction, and the shift distance is randomly generated within a certain range. We perform four different sets of experiments with shift distance 10-70, 70-130, 130-190, 190-240. For R test, we first randomly select the left or right direction, then the shift distance is randomly selected from 10-80, 80-150, 150-220, 220-290, 290-320. For RC test, both shift directions are generated followed R test and C test, the shift distance is randomly selected from 10-60, 60-110, 110-160, 160-210, 210-240. The experimental results are shown in Figure 3 a,b,c. It can be seen that the width shift is more effective for U6DA. In order to avoid overfitting to PVNet, we select width and height shift with 110-160 shift distance in the following experiments.</p>

<p id="S4.SS2.SSS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Since our U6DA attack is firstly performed on the segmentation model and then transfer to the 6D pose estimation models, in this section we explore the effect of different segmentation models on the transferability. We perform U6DA attack on the Unet <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>]</cite>, Unet++ <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib49" title="" class="ltx_ref">49</a>]</cite>, FPN <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>, DeepLabV3 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite> and their ensembles. The results are shown in Table <a href="#S4.T1" title="Table 1 ‣ 4.2.2 The effect of different segmentation models. ‣ 4.2 Sensitivity analysis ‣ 4 Experimental Results ‣ Adversarial samples for deep monocular 6D object pose estimation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>, the ensemble attack might increase the attack performance but requires much more computing resources. Unlike the adversarial attack of image classification that ensemble victim model will improve the transferability considerably <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>, our ensembled models do not always bring a performance improvement. For example, the combination of all models achieves relatively poor performance. Moreover, although the DeepLabV3 achieved the best attack performance over single model, it was slower than Unet, the DeepLabV3 needs 3.24s in every iteration of our U6DA attack while Unet only needs 0.08s in NVIDIA RTX 3090 GPU, we therefore select the Unet as our surrogate model in the following experiments.</p>

PVNet <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite>, the dense coordinate based methods CDPN <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite>.

The direct methods GDRNet are the most vulnerable to U6DA attack among three models. We infer that might be caused by the Linear Behavior <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite> of deep networks, the direct methods directly output the 6D pose from an input RGB image, a small perturbation to the input is enough to make the prediction result very biased. As for the dense coordinate based methods CDPN, which was not as robust as the key-point based methods PVNet. The ADD of all instance and networks are decreased significantly, which validate the effectiveness of our U6DA attack.</p>

Overall, the intermediate representation of PVNet is much robust than GDRNet, this might be the reason why PVNet is more robust than GDRNet under our U6DA.</p>

One interesting question would be are RGB-D based deep 6D pose estimation networks robust to RGB adversary? To answer this, we validate in Linemod dataset.
We perform U6DA attack on FFB6D <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>, PVN3D <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite> and DenseFusion <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib43" title="" class="ltx_ref">43</a>]</cite>. The results are shown in Table <a href="#S4.T6" title="Table 6 ‣ 4.6.2 Are RGB-D based deep 6D pose estimation networks robust to RGB adversary? ‣ 4.6 Extension studies ‣ 4 Experimental Results ‣ Adversarial samples for deep monocular 6D object pose estimation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">6</span></a>, we can observe that the RGB-D based deep 6D pose estimation networks are more robust to RGB adversary compared to the RGB based deep 6D pose estimation networks, the ADD of RGB-D models only slightly affected by RGB adversary.</p>

<p id="S4.SS7.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this section, we introduce U6DA-Linemod dataset. Following the BOP benchmark <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>, we use U6DA to attack Unet to generate adversarial samples from all the Linemod test set, we name this dataset as U6DA-Linemod. This dataset could be used for evaluating the robustness of SOTA 6D pose estimation models, and the adversarial defenses for 6D pose estimation also could benefit from it. The U6DA-Linemod can be download online, and by replacing the original BOP Linemod test set, the robustness of SOTA 6D pose estimation models could be evaluated.</p>

<div id="S5.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we propose U6DA, the first adversarial attack to deep 6D pose estimation networks. Our U6DA selects a segmentation model as surrogate model and then crafts adversarial samples by shifting the attention map. Extensive experiments reveal that the U6DA method is effective to fool all the three mainstream classes of 6D pose estimation networks with high transferability. Various experiments are performed to show properties of the U6DA such as parameter selection and effectiveness against data augmentation. Further more, we introduce a new U6DA-Linemod dataset, the first dataset on 6D pose estimation task to evaluate the robustness and defenses.
In the future, we plan to explore how to systematically improve pose estimation model’s robustness against adversarial samples such as those generated by the U6DA.</p>
