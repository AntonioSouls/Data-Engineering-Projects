<p id="id12.id1" class="ltx_p">The advancement of computer vision and machine learning has made datasets a crucial element for further research and applications. However, the creation and development of robots with advanced recognition capabilities are hindered by the lack of appropriate datasets. Existing image or video processing datasets are unable to accurately depict observations from a moving robot, and they do not contain the kinematics information necessary for robotic tasks. Synthetic data, on the other hand, are cost-effective to create and offer greater flexibility for adapting to various applications. Hence, they are widely utilized in both research and industry. In this paper, we propose the dataset HabitatDyn, which contains both synthetic RGB videos, semantic labels, and depth information, as well as kinetics information. HabitatDyn was created from the perspective of a mobile robot with a moving camera, and contains 30 scenes featuring six different types of moving objects with varying velocities. To demonstrate the usability of our dataset, two existing algorithms are used for evaluation and an approach to estimate the distance between the object and camera is implemented based on these segmentation methods and evaluated through the dataset. With the availability of this dataset, we aspire to foster further advancements in the field of mobile robotics, leading to more capable and intelligent robots that can navigate and interact with their environments more effectively. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/ignc-research/HabitatDyn.</p>

<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Dynamic object detection and tracking is an essential ability to realize a safe autonomous navigation for mobile robots. By detecting the object with distance and velocity estimations, the mobile robot can avoid potential collisions in an earlier stage, especially when the environment is highly dynamic <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>. Dynamic detection algorithms can also improve the robustness of a SLAM algorithm <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>. The further interaction and tracking ability also rely on the accuracy of the dynamic object detection<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>. Although research in dynamic object detection is making great progress thanks to the recent advances in deep learning algorithms, the limitation of the dataset and incomparable evaluation processes make it hard to develop, train, and evaluate algorithms <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>. When it comes to detecting moving objects in indoor environments, one major challenge is obtaining real-world data. In addition to requiring a significant amount of data, the datasets need to be tailored to the specific task, such as differentiating between the behaviors of pedestrians or agents in an indoor environment. As a result, dynamic object detection algorithms often lack the ability to extend to mobile robots, and further training and adaptations are necessary for deployment on real robots.</p>

<div id="S2.p1" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">With the advances in object detection and instance segmentation methods, research in navigation within dynamic environments became increasingly popular in recent years. A majority of the proposed approaches for SLAM in dynamic environments or collision avoidance algorithms partially rely on ta deep learning model. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>, the instance segmentation algorithms based SLAM algorithms for dynamic environments are introduced. With the commonly used Mask-RCNN approach <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>, the algorithm can filter out the ORB features<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite> on the dynamic objects, which leads to a stable mapping and localization. The research is based on the dataset for autonomous driving and evaluated for outdoor usage. Another research form Zhang et al. 2021 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite> argue that the dynamic information hold potential benefits for SLAM, and it is crucial for robotics to understand dynamic environments for tasks such as planing, control and obstacle avoidance. While most of the research works focus on outdoor environment, it is also essential for robots to understand indoor dynamic environments to facilitate a range of application such as service robots in hospitals, offices, or warehouses.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p2" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">For an in-door dynamic environment, Vincent et al.2020 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite> deployed an instance-segmentation-based approach to extend the Kalman filter and improve the accuracy and stability of a visual SLAM. DynaSLAM<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite> is also a visual SLAM approach proposed by Bescos te al. to facilitate robust navigation in Dynamic Scenes. Since the community oftentimes focuses on the potential solution for dynamic environments and dynamic object detections, a dataset based on dynamical environment is essential for further research, training, evaluation, and deployment of a deep-learning-based algorithm. The current dynamic object datasets like Davis<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite> or YouTube-VOS 2018 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite> are useful for training of the deep learning methods but not ideal for more kinematics estimation and evaluation, like pose and orientation estimation, velocity estimation, future movement estimation, or distance estimation. On this account, this work introduces a method, which is a combination of dynamic object segmentation algorithms, to estimate the kinematics of the dynamic object in an indoor environment. Furthermore, a dataset with full diversity and specialized for mobile robot application development is introduced.</p>

<div id="S3.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S3.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The quality and quantity of data are crucial factors, as they directly impact the performance, accuracy, and generalizability of the models being developed. The dataset comprises 720 short clips, captured by an embodied agent within a dynamic environment created using Habitat-sim. Each clip lasts 10 seconds and is recorded at a frequency of 24 frames per second (fps), resulting in 241 frames per clip. In total, there are 173,520 annotated frames, providing a substantial amount of data for training and evaluating the proof of concept for the algorithm. The data quality is tailored to the current onboard processing capacity of a mobile robot, utilizing a 480p resolution. This choice not only meets the robot’s processing capabilities, but also enhances the efficiency of the training and evaluation processes.</p>

It consists of recordings from 30 distinct scenes based on the photorealistic MP3D dataset, captured in real apartments. This variety ensures a diverse range of backgrounds, including different types of furniture and wall or floor textures. It also narrows the gap between synthetic data and reality compared to other synthetic datasets. SLAM research based on Habitat-sim can be transitioned to real-world environments with minimal effort <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>.</p>

In the pure dynamic clips category, all embedded objects are dynamic, while only the background from MP3D remains static. To prevent overfitting for object detection rather than dynamic object detection, the mixed dynamic clips category contains both static and dynamic embedded objects. As illustrated in figure <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ I Introduction ‣ HabitatDyn Dataset: Dynamic Object Detection to Kinematics Estimation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>, a static dog appears in front of a human while another dynamic dog moves around the corner.</p>

Most of the existing datasets contain the objects in every frame of the video, which may lead the model to believe that every frame contains the dynamic object and be overconfident for the estimation. Since the dynamic objects are randomly distributed and are performing a repetitive moving strategy according to our path setting, some of the frames may not include any moving object and some of them may have all the objects. The randomness of the presence is a more realistic way to handle the object presence.</p>

<p id="S4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Moving object detection in videos, also be referenced as salient objects detection, aims to label all interesting object(s) in consecutive video frames as foreground, regardless of which object category, e.g. dog, cat, it belongs to. So the understanding of the temporal relation of in-frame objects is critical. Conducting instance segmentation in video frames makes it even more challenging, as the model needs to perform dense per-pixel interpretation and requires a large receptive field concerning each pixel. On top of that, multi-scale features are also crucial to do per-pixel prediction, for instance segmentation. Common backbone structures that can leverage the multi-scale features includes Feature Pyramid Networks<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>, ResNet<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>, U-net<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite> and Swin-transformer<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>.</p>

<p id="S4.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The term unsupervised can be ambiguous in today’s deep learning field, unsupervised models mostly indicate that the models do not need any “ground truth” for training, making it highly appealing as it doesn’t need the effort for labeling the data, like the CIS model <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>. As for the video dataset DAVIS 2016 unsupervised<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>, the term “unsupervised“ is referring to the fact that during inference, the model does not need the user’s interaction to suggest the interesting or salient object for tracking.</p>

<p id="S4.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Two different algorithms, namely, 3DC-seg<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite> and CIS, are used to evaluate the datasets generated by this work. While 3DC-seg is the leading model in the DAVIS 2016 unsupervised dataset benchmark, the CIS model from 2019 ranks at around 20th place of the benchmark, it still has illuminating points like it does not acquire any ground truth annotation and thus can be seen as a truly unsupervised model.</p>

The performance of both algorithms drops when the static embedded objects are introduced. The decline of the performance is less on 3DC, but the algorithm also performs not well in a dynamic-embedded-object-only scenario. The IOU and Precision drops significantly because it takes a a high number of static embedded objects as dynamic object.

The performance decline of 3DC between those two environments on cat
<br class="ltx_break">dog category is significant and within every matrix. It may be caused by the outstanding color of skin of the 3D model, since the method is used for foreground segmentation. The human category also has the lowest Recall measurement in both of the methods. One possible reason could be that the Human class has a larger size than other models and has different parts such that it is harder to generate a mask to cover the entire body.

We considered objects, which have 10 meter or less distance to the robot, since the simulator also has a limited maximum depth of 10 meters. For mobile robots, an object 10 meters away has also minor influence to its navigation strategy. The estimation will first use the label to find the objects in the field of view and map the depth image into a top-down view. Subsequently, an intersection will be performed between the cluster from the labeled data and the cluster from the estimated data. A match will be established if two have the maximum intersections among all the pairs in regard to this frame.
For the data pairs, the following measurements will be used:</p>

Although the environment including static embedded objects reduce the performance of the dynamic object detection algorithm, the overall coordinates and distance estimation takes only a slight decrease of the detection rate.In figure <a href="#S5.F6" title="Figure 6 ‣ V-D Evaluation about Distance Estimation ‣ V Implementation and Evaluation ‣ HabitatDyn Dataset: Dynamic Object Detection to Kinematics Estimation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">6</span></a>, we demonstrate the samples of the results, the closed objects are mostly being detected while we lost the mask of the objects behind, since the 3DC is used to detect foreground objects. In the second column, we can find the static man is also being masked. It causes the wrong detection of dynamic objects, but whether it has a positive or negative influence on safety navigation is to be discussed and to be researched. In table <a href="#S5.T4" title="TABLE IV ‣ V-D Evaluation about Distance Estimation ‣ V Implementation and Evaluation ‣ HabitatDyn Dataset: Dynamic Object Detection to Kinematics Estimation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">IV</span></a>, we evaluate the approach according to different distance interval. The detection rate drops rapidly when the distance goes larger. But on the other hand, the error cause by the distant objects is much smaller. Since the distant object occupied only a small area of the pixel. An example is provided in figure <a href="#S4.F5" title="Figure 5 ‣ IV-B Kinematics Estimation ‣ IV Evaluated Algorithms ‣ HabitatDyn Dataset: Dynamic Object Detection to Kinematics Estimation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5</span></a>. It has the possibility to be removed by the algorithm as an outlier. The large error in the nearest area is due to the limitation resolution of the map. A possible solution is to create a gradient mesh to make the resolution of the map higher in the near robot area. The center point calculation can also be optimized for future performance improvement.</p>

<p id="S5.SS4.p3.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we presented the dataset HabitatDyn, which contains video records, depth information, and semantic labeling for dynamic environments. We were able to evaluate two dynamic object detection algorithms, CIS and 3DC, in multiple aspects and demonstrated that the two evaluated methods can be strongly influenced by static foreground objects. CIS will also be influenced by the speed of the
object, while 3DC is not sensitive to it. Based on the dynamic object detection algorithm, we also proposed a dynamic object distance estimation algorithm and evaluate it with HabitatDyn. The approach show a stable performance within a short distance, despite the volatile performance from the dynamic object detection algorithms. The approach shows that it is important to have a dataset as a bridge and
enable the research to test and evaluate different approaches. Ongoing works aim to refine the dataset for more mobile robotic related task and to refine the dynamic object detection algorithm by adding velocity estimation, pose estimation, movement prediction, the stability and detection rate of the
algorithm. Furthermore, we aspire to extend the robustness of the dynamic object detection with idle movable objects.</p>
