<p id="id15.id1" class="ltx_p">3D perception based on the representations learned from multi-camera bird’s-eye-view (BEV) is trending as cameras are cost-effective for mass production in autonomous driving industry. However, there exists a distinct performance gap between multi-camera BEV and LiDAR based 3D object detection. One key reason is that LiDAR captures accurate depth and other geometry measurements, while it is notoriously challenging to infer such 3D information from merely image input. In this work, we propose to boost the representation learning of a multi-camera BEV based student detector by training it to imitate the features of a well-trained LiDAR based teacher detector. We propose effective balancing strategy to enforce the student to focus on learning the crucial features from the teacher, and generalize knowledge transfer to multi-scale layers with temporal fusion.
We conduct extensive evaluations on multiple representative models of multi-camera BEV. Experiments reveal that our approach renders significant improvement over the student models, leading to the state-of-the-art performance on the popular benchmark nuScenes.</p>

<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Perceiving 3D environments is essential for autonomous driving as it is crucial for subsequent onboard modules from prediction <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>, <a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>]</cite> to planning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>. Although LiDAR based methods have achieved remarkable progress <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>, <a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>, <a href="#bib.bib41" title="" class="ltx_ref">41</a>]</cite>, there have recently been fast growing attentions to camera based approaches from both academia and industry <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite>. Compared to a sensor suite of LiDAR, the cost of cameras is typically 10 times cheaper, gaining a huge cost advantage for mass-production OEMs. Additionally, cameras are better suited to detect distant objects and recognize visual based road elements (e.g., traffic lights and signs).</p>

<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">A straightforward solution for camera based 3D object detection is the monocular paradigm that has been broadly studied <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>, <a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>, <a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>]</cite>. However, such methods have to deal with surrounding cameras separately and require complex post-processing to fuse detections from multiple views. As an alternative, the bird’s-eye-view (BEV) based framework is drawing extensive attentions to offer a holistic feature representation space from multi-camera images, and has made substantial improvement <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>, <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>. BEV based framework owns the following inherent merits including (i) joint feature learning from multi-view images, (ii) unified detection space without post fusion, (iii) amenability for temporal fusion, and (iv) convenient output representation for the downstream prediction and planning.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Despite the advancement achieved in this field, a distinct performance gap remains between multi-camera BEV and LiDAR based 3D object detection. For instance, the leading multi-camera BEV based method is outperformed by its LiDAR counterpart over 15% mAP and 10% NDS on popular benchmark nuScenes <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>.
On the other hand, a data collection fleet can be equipped with both cameras and LiDAR, while the mass-produced vehicles can be LiDAR-free.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">In light of above observations, we present <span id="S1.p4.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">DistillBEV</span>: a simple and effective cross-model knowledge distillation approach to bridge the feature learning gap between multi-camera BEV and LiDAR based detectors.
Our strategy toward achieving this goal is to align the corresponding features learned from images and point clouds. Given merely images as input, the multi-camera BEV based detector (student) is guided to imitate the features extracted from point clouds by a well-trained LiDAR based detector (teacher). We argue that the accurate 3D geometric cues such as depth and shape as well as how such cues are represented in the point cloud features provide valuable guidance to the training process of student model. Moreover, we emphasize that our approach incurs no extra computation cost during inference as the teacher model involves in training only.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Due to the notable discrepancy between the two modalities, the cross-modal knowledge distillation is extremely challenging.
Compared to camera images, LiDAR scans are inherently sparse, and the majority of 3D space is empty.
Even if in the occupied space, background (e.g., building and vegetation) dominates, and meanwhile, objects of interest (e.g., bus and pedestrian) are with largely varied sizes.
It is thus nontrivial to locate the informative regions to make the knowledge transfer more focused, and balance the distillation importance assigned to different foreground objects. Furthermore, the teacher and student models are respectively developed in their specific domains, leading to disparate network architectures. It is also demanding to generalize the cross-modal distillation to adapt to various combinations of different teacher and student networks.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">To tackle these challenges for DistillBEV, we first exploit region decomposition to partition a feature map into true positive, false positive, true negative and false negative regions, which elaborately decouple foreground and background in the cross-modal distillation. Based on this decomposition, we introduce adaptive scaling to balance the significantly varied box sizes when objects are presented in BEV. We further utilize spatial attention to encourage the student model to mimic the attention pattern produced by the teacher model, so as to focus on the crucial features for effective knowledge transfer. We then extend the distillation to multi-scale layers to achieve thorough feature alignment between teacher and student. Finally, we incorporate temporal information for both teacher and student models in BEV, thus enabling the distillation with temporal fusion readily. Thanks to the proposed generalizable design, our approach is flexible to be applied to various combinations of teacher and student detectors. As illustrated in Figure <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ DistillBEV: Boosting Multi-Camera 3D Object Detection with Cross-Modal Knowledge Distillation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>, DistillBEV consistently and remarkably improves multiple representative student models.</p>

<p id="S1.p7.1" class="ltx_p">Our main contributions are summarized as follows. First, we present the cross-modal distillation in BEV, which naturally suits for knowledge transfer between LiDAR and multi-camera BEV based detectors. Second, we propose the effective balancing design to enable the student to focus on learning crucial features of the teacher with multiple scales and temporal fusion. Third, our approach achieves superior performance, and more importantly, obtains consistent and considerable improvement on various teacher-student combinations.

A large family of the methods in this field are based on the monocular paradigm, such as FCOS3D <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>]</cite> and DD3D <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite>, which resemble 2D object detection. Recently, the multi-camera BEV based framework is trending thanks to its inherent merits. In this framework, the view transformation module plays a fundamental role to convert multi-view image features to BEV.
Some methods employ inverse perspective mapping <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite> or multilayer perceptron <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite> to perform the translation from perspective view to BEV.
In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite> LSS is introduced to lift image features by corresponding bin-wise depth distribution. This line of research includes a series of works such as BEVDet <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>, BEVDet4D <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>, and BEVDepth <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>.
BEVFormer is proposed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite> to utilize cross-attention to look up and aggregate image features across cameras. In addition, BEV representations provide a more desirable connection of scene features at multiple timestamps to improve object detection and motion state estimation. BEVDet4D and BEVDepth fuse previous and current features using spatial alignment, and BEVFormer performs fusion through temporal attention in a soft way.</p>

Since most methods of this field apply voxelization to transform irregular point clouds to regular grids such as pillars or voxels, it is natural to extract features in BEV. VoxelNet <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib44" title="" class="ltx_ref">44</a>]</cite> applies 3D convolutions on the aggregated point features inside each voxel. SECOND <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">39</a>]</cite> takes advantage of sparse 3D convolutions to improve computation efficiency. PointPillars <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite> proposes to collapse height dimension and use 2D convolutions to further reduce inference latency. CenterPoint <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib41" title="" class="ltx_ref">41</a>]</cite> is a popular anchor-free method that represents objects as points. PillarNeXt <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite> shows that the pillar based models with modernized designs in architecture and training outperforms the voxel counterpart in both accuracy and latency. Fusing multiple sensors is also widely used to enhance the detection performance.
MVP <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib42" title="" class="ltx_ref">42</a>]</cite> is a sensor-fusion version of CenterPoint enhanced by image virtual points.</p>

<p id="S2.p3.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S2.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Knowledge Distillation.</span>
This technique is originally proposed for network compression by transferring the information from a larger teacher model to a compact student model <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>. Most methods in the field are initially designed for image classification, but hardly make improvement for image object detection. Some recent methods have successfully adapted knowledge distillation for 2D object detection <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib40" title="" class="ltx_ref">40</a>, <a href="#bib.bib43" title="" class="ltx_ref">43</a>]</cite>. Nevertheless, the research on distillation for 3D object detection has been less explored, in particular when the teacher and student models come from different modalities <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>.
The most related work to our proposed approach is <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>, which introduces a dense foreground-guided feature imitation and a sparse instance-wise distillation to transfer spatial knowledge from LiDAR to multi-camera 3D object detection. Compared to this method, our approach achieves more fine-grained distillation through introducing region decomposition and adaptive scaling. Additionally, our design accommodates multi-scale distillation, which enhances cross-modal knowledge transfer at different feature abstractions. Experimental results also confirm the superiority of our approach.</p>

<div id="S3.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">It has been well acknowledged in 2D object detection that simply performing feature alignment between teacher and student hardly makes improvement due to the imbalance between foreground and background regions <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib40" title="" class="ltx_ref">40</a>, <a href="#bib.bib43" title="" class="ltx_ref">43</a>]</cite>. However, this phenomenon is even more severe in 3D object detection as the vast majority of 3D space is unoccupied. Our statistics on BEV feature maps finds that less than 30% pixels are non-empty on average, and among them, only a small fraction contains objects that we are interested in. To perform effective knowledge transfer, we introduce the region decomposition to guide the student to focus on crucial regions rather than treating all regions equally. Specifically, we partition a feature map into four types: true positive (TP), false positive (FP), true negative (TN) and false negative (FN).

<p id="S3.SS1.p2.4" class="ltx_p">This decomposition gives our approach the flexibility in assigning varied importance on different regions. It is straightforward to take into account the regions covered by ground truth boxes (i.e., the union of TP and FN regions), which exactly convey the features from foreground objects. However, we also treat FP regions differently from TN regions. When the teacher model generates high activations on some regions even though they are FP (e.g., a pole is misdetected as a pedestrian), encouraging the student model to mimic such feature responses can be still beneficial for the the overall 3D geometry learning.
FP regions can be found by thresholding the confidence heatmaps produced by the teacher detector and ground truth labels:</p>

<div id="S3.SS2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS2.p1.7" class="ltx_p">Another challenge to distill knowledge from teacher to student in BEV is the great span of various object sizes. For instance, a bus is dozens of times the size of a pedestrian from bird’s-eye-view. Moreover, background such as walls and plants overwhelm the non-empty regions. Thus, background stuff and giant foreground objects would dominate the distillation loss since substantially more features come from them. It is desirable to reflect different-sized objects or classes with similar contributions in the distillation loss. An adaptive scaling factor is introduced to achieve this goal:</p>

One successful application is the feature pyramid network <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>, which combines features from different levels to better detect objects of various sizes <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>, <a href="#bib.bib41" title="" class="ltx_ref">41</a>]</cite>.
To realize comprehensive alignment between teacher and student, we adopt this idea to perform feature distillation at multiple scales for the models based on CNNs.
However, the teacher and student networks are separately designed with different architectures, making it nontrivial to find intermediate feature correspondence. For instance, the BEV feature maps in teacher are usually 2<math id="S3.SS4.p1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\times" display="inline"><semantics id="S3.SS4.p1.1.m1.1a"><mo id="S3.SS4.p1.1.m1.1.1" xref="S3.SS4.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml">×</mo><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S3.SS4.p1.1.m1.1b"><times id="S3.SS4.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS4.p1.1.m1.1.1"></times></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S3.SS4.p1.1.m1.1c">\times</annotation></semantics></math> or 4<math id="S3.SS4.p1.2.m2.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\times" display="inline"><semantics id="S3.SS4.p1.2.m2.1a"><mo id="S3.SS4.p1.2.m2.1.1" xref="S3.SS4.p1.2.m2.1.1.cmml">×</mo><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S3.SS4.p1.2.m2.1b"><times id="S3.SS4.p1.2.m2.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS4.p1.2.m2.1.1"></times></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S3.SS4.p1.2.m2.1c">\times</annotation></semantics></math> the size of those in student. Naively aligning features of the same resolution results in incompatibility of the feature abstraction level.

We also find that feature imitation at early layers is detrimental to the distillation, which is because the representation discrepancy caused by the modality gap between point clouds and images remains substantial at the early stage.
Note we identify and utilize the FP regions only at the last encoding layer of BEV (i.e., the pre-head feature). We find this setting works the best presumably because FP regions are better expressed by high-level semantic features emerging at the last layer. See more architecture details in the supplementary material.</p>

Methods <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>, <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite> developed with temporal fusion greatly improve 3D object detection and motion estimation by leveraging important dynamic cues. As for LiDAR based models, it is a common practice to fuse multiple point clouds by directly transforming the past sweeps to the current coordinate frame through ego-motion compensation, and a relative timestamp is added to the measurements of each point <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib41" title="" class="ltx_ref">41</a>]</cite>. Thus, it is natural to conduct temporal knowledge transfer in our approach as the teacher can be readily compatible with the student making use of temporal information. In practice, we employ a unified teacher model for both single-frame and multi-frame based student models to perform distillation with temporal fusion.</p>

There are 10 classes in total for 3D object detection, and the annotations are provided at 2Hz. Following the standard evaluation split, 700, 150 and 150 scenes are respectively used for training, validation and test. We follow the official evaluation metrics including mean average precision (mAP) and nuScenes detection score (NDS) as the main metrics.

We implement our approach in PyTorch <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite>, and train the networks by using 8 NVIDIA Tesla V100 GPUs with the batch size of 64.
AdamW <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite> is adopted as the optimizer with a cosine-scheduled learning rate of 2e-4.
All models are trained for 24 epochs with the strategy of CBGS <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib45" title="" class="ltx_ref">45</a>]</cite>.

<div id="S4.SS2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We start from comparing the student performance before and after distillation on the validation set of nuScenes. As shown in Table <a href="#S4.T1" title="Table 1 ‣ 4.1 Experimental Setup ‣ 4 Experiments ‣ DistillBEV: Boosting Multi-Camera 3D Object Detection with Cross-Modal Knowledge Distillation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a> and Figure <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ DistillBEV: Boosting Multi-Camera 3D Object Detection with Cross-Modal Knowledge Distillation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>, DistillBEV using different teacher models considerably and consistently boosts the four representative students over various metrics. In particular, the most significant performance gains are obtained on BEVFormer, i.e., 4.4% mAP and 4.2% NDS. For the leading algorithm BEVDepth, we also observe the improvement of 3.9% mAP and 2.6% NDS, revealing that our distillation effect is not diminishing with the stronger student.</p>
</div>
<div id="S4.SS2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Taking a closer look into other metrics, we observe that DistillBEV largely improves mAVE of the single-frame based model (i.e., BEVDet). We attribute this to the temporal fusion nature in the teacher models, which effectively transfer temporal knowledge to the distilled students via our approach.
And the trend of mAAE follows mAVE as this attribute is predicted based on the velocity estimation. In general, there exits clear improvement in mATE and mAOE, thanks to the accurate depth and geometric cues encoded in point clouds. It is found that mASE is only slightly improved as the students already estimate object scale reasonably well by using visual information alone.</p>

<div id="S4.SS2.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS2.p3.2" class="ltx_p">We next compare DistillBEV with the state-of-the-art methods on the validation set and test set of nuScenes.

<p id="S4.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We perform extensive experiments to analyze and understand the proposed components and related design choices in DistillBEV. Unless otherwise mentioned, we disable the head inheriting, and exemplify the teacher and student detectors using MVP and BEVDet4D, respectively.</p>

Here we study the contribution of each individual component in our design through a set of combinatorial experiments. Starting from the basic feature imitation at multiple scales, we gradually add foreground and background region decomposition (no FP), spatial attention, adaptive scaling, and FP region decomposition. As shown in Table <a href="#S4.T4.st4" title="In Table 4 ‣ 4.2 Comparison with State-of-the-Art Methods ‣ 4 Experiments ‣ DistillBEV: Boosting Multi-Camera 3D Object Detection with Cross-Modal Knowledge Distillation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4(d)</span></a>, the naive feature imitation barely improves the baseline (32.8% vs 32.9% mAP, 45.9% vs 45.6% NDS), indicating that the basic feature alignment is inadequate for cross-modal distillation in BEV. In the proposed approach, each component makes decent improvement upon the basic feature imitation, and in the full model, these components collectively boost the baseline result by 5.0% mAP and 3.1% NDS.</p>
</div>

<p id="S4.SS3.p3.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S4.SS3.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Where to Distill.</span>
Next we study the impact of distilling at different layers between teacher and student in DistillBEV. As mentioned in Section <a href="#S3.SS4" title="3.4 Multi-Scale Distillation ‣ 3 Method ‣ DistillBEV: Boosting Multi-Camera 3D Object Detection with Cross-Modal Knowledge Distillation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3.4</span></a>, FP regions are only used on the pre-head feature map. So we disable the FP region decomposition for a fair comparison among different levels.
For the cross-modal distillation, the teacher and student networks are separately developed with distinct architectures, and the modality gap further complicates the problem. This differs from 2D object detection distillation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib43" title="" class="ltx_ref">43</a>]</cite>, where the teacher and student models can adopt similar architectures and both take images as input.
To alleviate this issue, we align features at similar abstraction level via the adaptation module.
We use H to indicate the pre-head layer, and B2-B0 to denote its three preceding intermediate layers
of the BEV encoders in both teacher and student.
As shown in Table <a href="#S4.T4.st3" title="In Table 4 ‣ 4.2 Comparison with State-of-the-Art Methods ‣ 4 Experiments ‣ DistillBEV: Boosting Multi-Camera 3D Object Detection with Cross-Modal Knowledge Distillation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4(c)</span></a>, our multi-scale distillation shows a clear advantage over distilling at the pre-head layer alone (36.8% vs 34.9% mAP, 48.4% vs 46.2% NDS). It is also noteworthy that aligning features from an early layer (B0) is negative, presumably because the representation gap between point clouds and images remains large at the early stage.</p>

This shows that the feature responses even at FP regions produced by teacher is assistive in 3D geometric knowledge transfer. We further evaluate this strategy on multi-scale layers. As compared in Table <a href="#S4.T4.st2" title="In Table 4 ‣ 4.2 Comparison with State-of-the-Art Methods ‣ 4 Experiments ‣ DistillBEV: Boosting Multi-Camera 3D Object Detection with Cross-Modal Knowledge Distillation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4(b)</span></a>, FP region decomposition performs better with the pre-head layer only. We hypothesize that such regions can be better represented by the features with high-level semantics that emerge at the last layer.</p>

<p id="S4.SS3.p5.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S4.SS3.p5.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Adaptation Module.</span>
A lightweight adaptation module is employed to map the student feature before aligning to the teacher feature at the corresponding level. This operation is necessary to match the feature size (spatial and channel dimensions) for multi-scale distillation between two discrepant architectures, and to provide extra flexibility to mitigate the difficulty in cross-modal feature imitation learning. We evaluate different design choices of the adaptation module in Table <a href="#S4.T4.st5" title="In Table 4 ‣ 4.2 Comparison with State-of-the-Art Methods ‣ 4 Experiments ‣ DistillBEV: Boosting Multi-Camera 3D Object Detection with Cross-Modal Knowledge Distillation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4(e)</span></a>.
It is observed that a simple linear projection works comparably well for the pre-head layer, while the intermediate layers require more non-linear mapping.
This comparison suggests that the student features from intermediate layers need more adaptation in order to better align with the teacher features due to the relatively large representation gap at the early stage caused by different modalities. As for dimension matching, we can either upsample student features or downsample teacher features. Table <a href="#S4.T4.st5" title="In Table 4 ‣ 4.2 Comparison with State-of-the-Art Methods ‣ 4 Experiments ‣ DistillBEV: Boosting Multi-Camera 3D Object Detection with Cross-Modal Knowledge Distillation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4(e)</span></a> shows that upsampling student features is favorable as it preserves more spatial details for feature alignment.</p>

Finally, we investigate the effect of different teacher models for knowledge distillation in BEV. Here we use BEVDet as the student model, and choose three teacher models including BEVDepth, CenterPoint and MVP, which represent the multi-camera BEV, LiDAR and camera-LiDAR fusion based detectors. Table <a href="#S4.T6" title="Table 6 ‣ 4.3 Ablation Study ‣ 4 Experiments ‣ DistillBEV: Boosting Multi-Camera 3D Object Detection with Cross-Modal Knowledge Distillation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">6</span></a> shows that the distillation across modalities clearly outperforms that within camera modality, validating the advantage of features extracted from point clouds to guide the student detector for more effective representation learning. We can further improve the student model by switching to the sensor-fusion based teacher model MVP, which shares similar network capacity as CenterPoint (both are much more compact than BEVDepth).
As shown in Table <a href="#S4.T5" title="Table 5 ‣ 4.3 Ablation Study ‣ 4 Experiments ‣ DistillBEV: Boosting Multi-Camera 3D Object Detection with Cross-Modal Knowledge Distillation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5</span></a>, compared to CenterPoint, MVP boosts the overall performance, in particular for small objects such as pedestrian and motorcycle. This is due to the fact that point clouds become increasingly sparse for small or distant objects, and augmenting point clouds with dense image information alleviates this issue.</p>

DistillBEV successfully detects three objects that are missed by the baseline, in particular for the two distant vehicles indexed by “2” and “3”. One can also see that our approach localizes objects with more accurate depth as marked by the green arrows.
These examples qualitatively show the efficacy of the proposed approach to enhance the multi-camera BEV based 3D object detectors.</p>

<div id="S5.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We have presented DistillBEV, a simple and effective approach that guides the learning process of a multi-camera BEV based student model through a more powerful LiDAR based teacher model. Extensive experiments on eight teacher-student combinations reveal that our approach consistently renders significant performance gains with no extra computation cost during inference. This demonstrates that our approach is not just geared to a particular network but is flexible to cope with a broad range of models in both CNNs and Transformers. In the future work, we intend to explore and apply the proposed approach to more multi-camera perception tasks in BEV, such as segmentation, tracking and online high-definition map construction.</p>

<p id="A1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">As discussed in the main paper, the LiDAR based teacher model and the multi-camera BEV based student model are separately developed in their specific domains, resulting in different architectures.</p>
</div>
<div id="A1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="A1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">We first illustrate the CNNs based architectures as well as the corresponding multi-scale distillation in Figure <a href="#A0.F4" title="Figure 4 ‣ DistillBEV: Boosting Multi-Camera 3D Object Detection with Cross-Modal Knowledge Distillation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a>, where H indicates the pre-head layer and B2-B0 denote its three preceding intermediate layers. This figure shows the differences between teacher and student, such as feature map sizes, structures, connections, etc. We introduce the lightweight adaptation module to map the student features before aligning with the associated teacher features. It is also observed that distilling at B0 is detrimental, presumably because the representation gap between the two modalities remains large at the early stage.</p>

<div id="A1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="A1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">To facilitate the cross-modal distillation for BEVFormer, we develop the Transformers based teacher model built on top of CenterPoint or MVP.

<div id="A2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="A2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Next we take a closer look into the learning process of the student model before and after applying DistillBEV. As shown in Figure <a href="#A2.F6" title="Figure 6 ‣ Appendix B Training Process ‣ DistillBEV: Boosting Multi-Camera 3D Object Detection with Cross-Modal Knowledge Distillation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">6</span></a>, the proposed cross-modal distillation approach brings consistent improvements over the baseline (exemplified with BEVDet4D).
Comparing the two different teacher models, we observe that MVP (camera-LiDAR fusion) is more effective than CenterPoint (LiDAR only) to perform distillation in general, and the performance gains are not diminishing along with the training.</p>
</div>
<div id="A2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="A2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">As for the extra training time induced by our approach, training with 8 V100 GPUs, the student model takes 42.3 hours, and DistillBEV conducted on this model uses 49.0 hours (+15.8%), which is a relatively low extra training cost compared to the large performance gain.</p>

<div id="A3.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="A3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">To investigate the cross-modal distillation effect to the change of student features, we visualize the spatial attention maps generated by the teacher and student models (with and without DistillBEV) following Equations (4-5) in the main paper. As shown in Figure <a href="#A4.F7" title="Figure 7 ‣ Appendix D More Implementation Details ‣ DistillBEV: Boosting Multi-Camera 3D Object Detection with Cross-Modal Knowledge Distillation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">7</span></a>, the spatial attention map generated by the student exhibits a drastically different pattern compared to the one by the teacher model. The former concentrates on the central area (i.e., close to the ego-vehicle), and rarely activates in some distant yet important areas. After training with DistillBEV, the attention map produced by student becomes sharper and is more similar to the one of teacher in both nearby and faraway regions.</p>
