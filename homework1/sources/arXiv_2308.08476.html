<p id="id3.id1" class="ltx_p">In object detection, the cost of labeling is much high because it needs not only to confirm the categories of multiple objects in an image but also to accurately determine the bounding boxes of each object. Thus, integrating active learning into object detection will raise pretty positive significance. In this paper, we propose a classification committee for active deep object detection method by introducing a discrepancy mechanism of multiple classifiers for samples’ selection when training object detectors. The model contains a main detector and a classification committee. The main detector denotes the target object detector trained from a labeled pool composed of the selected informative images. The role of the classification committee is to select the most informative images according to their uncertainty values from the view of classification, which is expected to focus more on the discrepancy and representative of instances. Specifically, they compute the uncertainty for a specified instance within the image by measuring its discrepancy output by the committee pre-trained via the proposed Maximum Classifiers Discrepancy Group Loss (MCDGL). The most informative images are finally determined by selecting the ones with many high-uncertainty instances. Besides, to mitigate the impact of interference instances, we design a Focus on Positive Instances Loss (FPIL) to make the committee the ability to automatically focus on the representative instances as well as precisely encode their discrepancies for the same instance. Experiments are conducted on Pascal VOC and COCO datasets versus some popular object detectors. And results show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art active learning methods, which verifies the effectiveness of the proposed method.</p>

<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Deep learning technology is developing very fast in the field of object detection <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>, it is necessary not only to design appropriate models and training strategies but also to acquire a great amount of training data. Generally, the cost of obtaining many labeled samples is very expensive. For this problem, active learning comes into being, the aim of active learning is to select the most informative samples for a specific task. In computer vision, previous research for active learning focus on image classification <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>. The labeling work for image classification is relatively easy compared to labeling for object detection because an image for object detection not only contains the classification labels of multiple objects but also needs to precisely label the bounding boxes of all objects in the image. Thus, active learning techniques are increasingly needed in the field of object detection <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>.</p>

<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The key idea of active learning is how to evaluate the most informative samples from unlabeled data for the target model <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>, <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>, <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>, <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>, <a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>, <a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite>. Current active learning approaches mainly aim at the classification task and utilize an uncertainty-based strategy to measure the output of the target model <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>, <a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>, <a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>, <a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite>. For anchor-based object detection, because one head of the object detector is to determine the classification label, some traditional strategies for image classification can be introduced on the classification cue of the detector <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>, <a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite>. The reasons that classification-based active learning methods can work well for object detectors are: (1) The classifier has the higher spatial sensitivity than the localization cue and can better distinguish the complete object and part of an object through observing the output feature maps of both localization and classification <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite>. (2) The localization loss only works when an anchor box is an object <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite> when lots of inaccurate boxes are obtained in the prediction stage, they may interfere with the uncertainty evaluation. As a comparison, the classification cue is less affected than the localization cue.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Although effective, the current classification-based active learning methods usually use one classifier to evaluate and sum the uncertainty of predicted multiple objects as an image score <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>, <a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite>. There are four disadvantages to such a process:
(1) one classification’s output is not considered to evaluate samples’ uncertainty from multiple perspectives in the feature space, because one decision boundary trained by the labeled samples is not really accurate for the unlabeled samples and misses the potential information. (2) The distribution difference between labeled and unlabeled data sets is not considered. When directly extending the model trained on the labeled data set to the uncertainty evaluation of the unlabeled data set, it will result in inaccurate predictions in the unlabeled data set. (3) The detector is a deep model but the current selector utilizes the handcrafted feature or rule-based metric. It is a static system with poor portability and knowledge bottleneck, which does not use learning-based assessment from learned features of itself, resulting in the loss of information evaluation. (4) Aggregating uncertain instances directly cannot represent the uncertainty of the image effectively, because it contains lots of background information which is extremely imbalanced for positive instances <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite> and this phenomenon can destroy the consistency of foreground uncertainty and image uncertainty, hindering the selection of informative samples.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">In order to solve the above problems, we propose a classification committee for active deep object detection method, selecting informative images from the unlabeled pool by considering the discrepancy of multiple classifiers’ decision boundaries.
The model architecture is shown in Figure <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ I Introduction ‣ Classification Committee for Active Deep Object Detection" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>, a classification committee composed of multiple classifiers evaluates the uncertainty of the image from multiple perspectives for sample selection to improve the performance of the main detector faster. Maximum discrepancy learning in the committee is the deep feature, to expect maximum discrepancies between pairwise members in the committee, the discrepancy of learning needs to traverse all possible member combinations, which is inefficient. So, we propose Maximum Classifiers Discrepancy Group Loss (MCDGL) to train the committee on the unlabeled pool, which maximizes the discrepancy by keeping each member away from their center at the same time.
Meanwhile, for the committee to focus as much as possible on the uncertainty of more representative positive instances, we propose the Focus on Positive Instances Loss (FPIL) that utilizes the scores of the main classifier weighted to MCDGL, as shown in Figure <a href="#S1.F2" title="Figure 2 ‣ I Introduction ‣ Classification Committee for Active Deep Object Detection" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>, narrowing the discrepancies of interference instances and filtering out background information in instance selection for image uncertainty estimation. By highlighting the uncertainty of the representative instances as the uncertainty of the image, the most informative samples are added to the training set to train the detector in the next cycle.</p>

<p id="S2.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Deep learning generally requires large amounts of data, which drives the development of active learning. Common active learning strategies can be used directly in deep learning, which can calculate a posterior probability distribution whose shape can reflect the uncertainty of the sample. For example, least confidence selects minimum confidence of maximum classification score from unlabeled pooling <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>, <a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>]</cite>. Also, relying on entropy measures information of unlabeled data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>, <a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>]</cite>. Meanwhile, some researchers also focus on data distribution, Core-Set <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>, <a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>]</cite> estimates the diversity of a set, utilizing the model trained by labeled samples to obtain the diversity of the unlabeled samples. The clusters center <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">38</a>, <a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">39</a>]</cite> for the probability distribution of unlabeled samples is the most representative sample. The sample with the largest change in expected parameters and predicted losses is usually the sample with the most effective information <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib40" title="" class="ltx_ref">40</a>, <a href="#bib.bib41" title="" class="ltx_ref">41</a>, <a href="#bib.bib42" title="" class="ltx_ref">42</a>]</cite>. In addition, an adversarial network is trained to discriminate whether a latent space of variational autoencoder is from a label sample pooling or unlabeled pooling <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>. Learning loss <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib43" title="" class="ltx_ref">43</a>]</cite> adds additional modules from the feature layer to learn uncertainty which is predicted loss, it is the deep feature for uncertainty estimation, but only the model trained by labeled samples is used to analyze the uncertainty of unlabeled samples. An image for object detection contains not only different categories and quantities of objects but also a large amount of background information. Neither collecting uncertain instances nor using the information of the intermediate feature layer to predict the information amount can directly represent the information amount of the image and they cannot be used directly for active deep object detection effectively.</p>

<p id="S2.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In recent years, in addition to simply porting the method of the classification task, some researchers have introduced novel active learning into object detection in the field of deep learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib44" title="" class="ltx_ref">44</a>, <a href="#bib.bib45" title="" class="ltx_ref">45</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>. Actually, learning loss is also applied to object detection <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib43" title="" class="ltx_ref">43</a>]</cite>, but the global average pooling can not represent the sum of uncertainties of multiple objects of the entire image. Also, pixel-level uncertainty can aggregate image-level uncertainty, according to the image-level uncertainty to select the most informative image <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib46" title="" class="ltx_ref">46</a>]</cite>. Query by committee consists of multiple decision makers and can search for the samples that have the most disagreement of different perspectives <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib47" title="" class="ltx_ref">47</a>]</cite>. Querying images also utilize the disagreement between the convolution layers in the SSD <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite>, but the method also designs more complex handcraft feature or rule-based metric rather than automatically learned deep features. These methods also ignore the uncertainty caused by a large amount of background interference information, and the information of the middle layer or various aggregation methods are not fully representative of the information of the image and also are only trained with labeled samples for information evaluation of unlabeled samples. MI-AOD <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite> combines semi-supervised and pseudo-labeling techniques to make it impossible to determine whether active learning plays a role in the end because both of these techniques are involved in backbone promotion. Two classifiers without the main detector interfere with each other, and multi-instance learning focuses more on whether there is an object, and the score of whether an instance is background is not accurate enough. Moreover, the training process of MI-AOD is more complex and needs repeated back-and-forth adversarial training.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In contrast, our approach utilizes committee discrepancy to evaluate the value of images, which can observe the uncertainty of the sample from multiple decision boundaries. The committee needs to be trained with unlabeled samples, it is independent of the main detector so as not to affect the performance of the main detector, and the training process is also independent rather than adversarial training. Uncertainty learning is also a deep feature suitable for the uncertainty assessment of deep models.</p>

<p id="S3.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In the study, we focus on anchor-based object detection for active learning. These methods present a large number of anchor boxes, and an anchor box is defined as an instance that contains anchor features <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib48" title="" class="ltx_ref">48</a>]</cite>. To evaluate the uncertainty of unlabeled instances in an unlabeled image by using the trained object detection model, we propose a classification committee as a set of auxiliary classifiers on the original detector, which does not affect the performance of the main detector by detaching the gradient between the feature extractor and the committee, as shown in Figure <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ I Introduction ‣ Classification Committee for Active Deep Object Detection" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>. The structure is different from MI-AOD, our approach does not involve and apply complex adversarial training. The discrepancy of the classification committee represents the uncertainty of instances in the image, and we design MCDGL to learn the discrepancy of these classifiers that maximize instances of discrepancy in the committee. For an image, lots of instances belonging to the background and interference information can affect the uncertainty estimation of the whole image, which can cause these most uncertain instances not to represent the true amount of information in the image. Thus, we propose FPIL that can focus more on the discrepancy of positive instances, which utilizes the main classification score to weight MCDGL and requires no additional image-level calculation, as shown in Figure <a href="#S3.F3" title="Figure 3 ‣ III-B Classification Committee for Uncertainty ‣ III Methods ‣ Classification Committee for Active Deep Object Detection" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a>.</p>

<p id="S3.SS2.p1.47" class="ltx_p">Both the main detector and classification committee can perform well on the labeled pool, and their output features are similar, as shown in Figure <a href="#S3.F3" title="Figure 3 ‣ III-B Classification Committee for Uncertainty ‣ III Methods ‣ Classification Committee for Active Deep Object Detection" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a> (1). The main detector is mainly used for detection work and the classification committee is mainly used to calculate the discrepancy of the unlabeled instances. The main classifier is not trained with unlabeled samples, so the discrepancy calculation process will not be added, and the classification committee will not affect the performance of the main detection. Therefore, the committee needs to maximize uncertainty for instances on the unlabeled pool, as shown in Figure <a href="#S1.F2" title="Figure 2 ‣ I Introduction ‣ Classification Committee for Active Deep Object Detection" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a> and Figure <a href="#S3.F3" title="Figure 3 ‣ III-B Classification Committee for Uncertainty ‣ III Methods ‣ Classification Committee for Active Deep Object Detection" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a> (2). Thus, the discrepancy among the members is as follows</p>

This paper <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib49" title="" class="ltx_ref">49</a>]</cite> needs to narrow the distance among pairs of samples from different feature groups. Inspired by <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib47" title="" class="ltx_ref">47</a>]</cite>, maximizing the discrepancy of the committee, the information gain for the sample query can be improved. Thus, we also hope that maximization Eq.(<a href="#S3.E6" title="In III-B Classification Committee for Uncertainty ‣ III Methods ‣ Classification Committee for Active Deep Object Detection" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">6</span></a>) is to learn the sum of the discrepancy of all of these pairs of members, thus the formula is named Maximum Classifiers Discrepancy Group Loss (MCDGL).

For experimental fairness, focus only on active learning itself. The training process is not complex adversarial training and is not suitable for semi-supervised learning.</p>

The experiments use two datasets: PASCAL VOC dataset and MS-COCO dataset. For PASCAL VOC, it contains 20 categories, VOC07 trainval and VOC12 trainval are used in the training phase, and VOC07 test is used in the test phase. The number of images is 16551 for the training phase and active learning, and the test phase uses 4952 images.
For MS-COCO, it contains 80 categories and includes lots of dense objects and small objects, which are difficult to object detection. For active learning, the training set uses MS-COCO 2014 which contains 117k images for training, and evaluates the results of MS-COCO 2017 which contains 5k images. The evaluation metric is mean average precision (mAP).</p>

For active learning, we mainly adopt the RetinaNet <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib48" title="" class="ltx_ref">48</a>]</cite> based on ResNet-50 and SSD <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite> based on VGG-16 as the base detector, which is widely used in active learning research for object detection <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib43" title="" class="ltx_ref">43</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib50" title="" class="ltx_ref">50</a>, <a href="#bib.bib51" title="" class="ltx_ref">51</a>]</cite>. For RetinaNet on PASCAL VOC, we randomly selected 5% of the training set as the initial labeled data. Then, in each cycle, we select 2.5% of the training set from the rest labeled images until 20.0% of the training set budget is consumed. The selection process reference <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>. For SSD on PASCAL VOC, we use 1000 labeled images as the initial labeled images. In each cycle, we also select 1000 images to add to the labeling image set, which refers to <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib43" title="" class="ltx_ref">43</a>]</cite>. The selection interval is about 6% of the training set. For RetinaNet on COCO, the training configuration is the same as PASCAL VOC. For active learning, the selection interval is about 2% of the training set.</p>

All experiments use an RTX 3080 GPU. Specifically, in Figure <a href="#S3.F4" title="Figure 4 ‣ III-C Enhancement of Uncertain Positive Instances ‣ III Methods ‣ Classification Committee for Active Deep Object Detection" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a>, the configuration of each experiment is as follows: For RetinaNet on PASCAL VOC, in each active cycle, the total number of epochs is 26, which contains 22 epochs for labeled images and 4 epochs for unlabeled images with the mini-batch size 2 and the learning rate 0.001. The momentum and the weight decay are set to 0.9 and 0.0001 respectively. For SSD on PASCAL VOC, in each active cycle, the labeled images is used to train the model 240 epochs and the unlabeled images is used to train the model 32 epochs. The momentum and the weight decay also are set to 0.9 and 0.0001. For RetinaNet on COCO, the training configuration is the same as PASCAL VOC.</p>

Obviously, our method vastly outperforms Random sampling, Entropy sampling, Core-set, CADL, LLAL, and DivProto in all cycles. Especially in the early stage of image selection, the increase in this period is larger than that in the later stage. The experimental result respectively outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 5.22%, 5.47%, and 2.86% when selecting 5.0%, 7.5%, and 10.0% images. Using up all the budget can reach 71.41%, which significantly outperforms CDAL by 2.11%. The experimental results of SSD are shown in Figure <a href="#S3.F4" title="Figure 4 ‣ III-C Enhancement of Uncertain Positive Instances ‣ III Methods ‣ Classification Committee for Active Deep Object Detection" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a> (2). The experimental effect of SSD also exceeds that of all comparison methods in all cycles. Compared with other methods, the degree of improvement in the first few cycles of image selection is obviously greater than that in the later cycles, and this phenomenon is similar to that when using RetinaNet. The experimental performance outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 1.17% and 1.35% when active learning is carried out in the second and third cycles respectively.
Particularly, for MI-AOD, the method is a combination method of semi-supervised, active learning, and pseudo-labeling. Our method also Significantly outperforms MI-AOD in all selection cycle.</p>

In the first cycle, it outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 1.14%. Similarly to the previous experiments, the degree of improvement in the first few cycles of image selection is obviously greater than that in the later cycles. Analogously, our method also exceeds MI-AOD which combines semi-supervised and pseudo-labeling techniques. These comparative experiments show the general applicability of our method.</p>

Fewer positive instances are selected without FPIL than with FPIL. These selected instances are both positive instances and instances with high uncertainty. The more such instances are included in an image, the greater the information content of the image will be and the greater the improvement of the model will be, which also proves the effectiveness of our method.</p>

The recognition accuracy of different objects is improved faster and the results are more stable. For densely stacked objects, this method can also be faster and more accurately separated. Obviously, the proposed method gets good results faster.
In Figure <a href="#S4.F5" title="Figure 5 ‣ IV-A Experimental Settings ‣ IV Experiments ‣ Classification Committee for Active Deep Object Detection" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5</span></a>, these discrepancy scores are obtained by the Classification Committee in the early cycle, the top half shows images with more objects by our method, and the bottom half shows images with fewer objects and more complicated background information by Entropy sampling. The results show that images with more objects have a larger uncertainty score, and images with complex backgrounds also have high uncertainty scores.
Thus, sample selection is likely to pick up a lot of background information which prevents rapid model improvement. Using FPIL can significantly reduce the uncertainty of complex background images for selecting more valuable images.
These phenomena directly prove the effectiveness of the proposed method. The experiment proves that our method can filter out the interfering instances, which selects more representative instances in an image for calculating uncertainty.</p>

<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In the paper, we propose an active deep model for object detection, which contains a main detector and a classification committee. The main detector is the original detector, and the classification committee trained by Maximum Classifiers Discrepancy Group Loss (MCDGL) is as basic for uncertainty evaluation on object detection. To suppress interference instances, the Focus on Positive Instances Loss (FPIL) can modify MCDGL, which makes discrepancy learning more focused on positive instances. The sum of the selected uncertain instances of the images is the amount of information on the image. Experiments on different datasets and different object detection models have validated the superiority of our method compared with state-of-the-art methods. The proposed method can provide a new direction for active deep object detection. This paper’s approach relies on uncertainty learning for active deep object detection. Future work will explore novel ideas for active learning, incorporating sample diversity measures into the learning process.</p>
