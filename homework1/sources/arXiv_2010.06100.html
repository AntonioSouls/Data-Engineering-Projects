<p id="id2.id1" class="ltx_p">Infant motion analysis is a topic with critical importance in early childhood development studies. However, while the applications of human pose estimation have become more and more broad, models trained on large-scale adult pose datasets are barely successful in estimating infant poses due to the significant differences in their body ratio and the versatility of their poses. Moreover, the privacy and security considerations hinder the availability of adequate infant pose data required for training of a robust model from scratch. To address this problem, this paper presents (1) building and publicly releasing a hybrid synthetic and real infant pose (SyRIP) dataset with small yet diverse real infant images as well as generated synthetic infant poses and (2) a multi-stage invariant representation learning strategy that could transfer the knowledge from the adjacent domains of adult poses and synthetic infant images into our fine-tuned domain-adapted infant pose (FiDIP) estimation model. In our ablation study, with identical network structure, models trained on SyRIP dataset show noticeable improvement over the ones trained on the only other public infant pose datasets. Integrated with pose estimation backbone networks with varying complexity, FiDIP performs consistently better than the fine-tuned versions of those models. One of our best infant pose estimation performers on the state-of-the-art DarkPose model shows mean average precision (mAP) of 93.6<span id="footnote1" class="ltx_note ltx_role_footnote"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">1</sup><span class="ltx_note_outer"><span class="ltx_note_content"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">1</sup><span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_note">1</span>The code is available at: <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/ostadabbas/Infant-Pose-Estimation" title="" class="ltx_ref ltx_href">github.com/ostadabbas/Infant-PoseEstimation</a>.

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Current efforts in machine learning, especially with the recent waves of deep learning models introduced in the last decade, have obliterated records for regression and classification tasks that have previously seen only incremental accuracy improvements. However, this performance comes at a large data cost. There are many other applications that would significantly benefit from the deep learning, where data collection or labeling is expensive and limited. In these domains, which we refer to as “Small Data” domains, the challenge we facing is how to learn efficiently with the same performance with less data. One example of these applications with the small data challenges is the problem of infant pose estimation. In infants, long-term monitoring of their poses provide information about their health condition and accurate recognition of these poses can lead to a better early developmental risk assessment and diagnosis <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>. Both motor delays and atypical movements are presented in children with cerebral palsy and are risk indicators for autism spectrum disorders <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>, <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">However, current publicly available human pose datasets are predominantly from scenes such as sports, TV shows, and other daily activities performed by adult humans, and none of these datasets provides any specific infants or young children pose images. Beside privacy issues which hamper large-scale data collection from infant, infant pose images differ from available adult pose datasets due to the notable differences in their pose distribution (see Fig. <a href="#S5.F5" title="Figure 5 ‣ Ablation study ‣ V-D Evaluation over FiDIP ‣ V Experimental Evaluation ‣ Invariant Representation Learning for Infant Pose Estimation with Small Data" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5</span></a>(a)) compared to the common adult poses collected from surveillance viewpoints <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>.
These differences mainly come from (1) shorter limbs and completely different bone to muscle ratio compared to adults; (2) different activities, appearances, and environmental contexts, which together result in sub-optimal performance of the pre-trained models trained on adult poses when tested on infant images (see Section <a href="#S5" title="V Experimental Evaluation ‣ Invariant Representation Learning for Infant Pose Estimation with Small Data" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">V</span></a>) with either over-prediction or under-prediction of the limb sizes.</p>

<div id="S2.SS0.SSS0.Px1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS0.SSS0.Px1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">For applications that require infant posture/motion analysis, the current approaches are dominantly based on (real-time or recorded) visual observation by the infant’s pediatrician or the use of contact-based inertial sensors <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. Meanwhile, there exist very few recent attempts initiated by the computer vision community to automatically perform pose estimation and tracking on videos taken from infants. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>, the authors estimated 3D body pose of infants in depth images for their motion analysis purpose, however they only evaluated their method on simple supine positions from limited number of subjects. They employed a pixel-wise body part classifier using random ferns to predict infant’s 3D joints in order to automate the task of motion analysis for identifying infantile motor disorders. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>, the authors presented a statistical learning method called 3D skinned multi-infant linear (SMIL) body model using incomplete low quality RGB-D sequence of freely moving infants. The specific dataset they used is provided in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>, where users mapped real infant movements to the SMIL model with natural shapes and textures, and generated RGB and depth images with 2D and 3D joint positions. However, both of these works rely heavily on having access to the RGBD data sequence, which is difficult to obtain and hinder the use of these algorithms in regular webcam-based baby monitoring systems.</p>

<p id="S2.SS0.SSS0.Px2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Synthesizing complicated articulated 3D models such as a human body has been drawing huge attention lately due to its extensive applications in studying human poses, gestures, and activities. Among benefits of synthesizing data is the possibility to automatically generate enough labeled data for supervised learning purposes, especially in small data domains. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>, the authors introduce a semi-supervised data augmentation approach that can synthesize large-scale labeled pose datasets using 3D graphical engines based on a physically-valid low dimensional pose descriptor. As introduced in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>, 3D human poses can be reconstructed by learning a geometry-aware body representation from multi-view images without annotations. Another research trend in synthesizing human pose images is simulating human figures by employing generative adversarial network (GAN) techniques. The authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite> present a two-stage pose-guided person generation network to integrate pose by feeding a reference image and a novel pose into a U-Net-like network to generate a coarse reposed person image, and refine image by training the U-Net-like generator in an adversarial way. In these works, however, neither the generated human avatars nor the reconstructed poses are able to accurately adapt to the infant style. Additionally, these GAN-based approaches of synthetic human figures do not have the capabilities of simulating complicated poses regularly taken by infants.</p>

<div id="S3.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">As stated earlier, there is a shortage of labeled infant pose dataset, and despite recent efforts in developing them, a versatile dataset with different and complex poses to train a deep network on is yet to be built. The only publicly-available infant image dataset is MINI-RGBD dataset <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>, which provides only 12 synthetic infant models with continuous pose sequences. However, beside having simple poses, MINI-RGBD sequential feature leads to a small variation in the poses between adjacent frames and the poses of whole dataset are mainly repeated. In Fig. <a href="#S3.F3" title="Figure 3 ‣ III SyRIP: Synthetic/Real Infant Pose Dataset for Pose Data Augmentation ‣ Invariant Representation Learning for Infant Pose Estimation with Small Data" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a>(a), we show the distribution of body poses of MINI-RGBD dataset and observe that poses in this dataset are simple and lack variations. Both its simplicity and being exclusively synthetic would cause the pose estimation models trained on MINI-RGBD to not generalize well to the real-world infant images.</p>

<div id="S3.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.p2.1" class="ltx_p">However, collecting and fully annotating a large-scale real infant pose dataset comparable to the size of adult pose datasets is very challenging, due to the privacy concerns that have also limited the number of samples in the web. To address this data limitation, we present a hybrid dataset forming strategy by mixing both real and synthetic infant pose data to form our SyRIP dataset, which exploits not only the real infant pose and appearance information, but also the data augmentation flexibility through using a set of synthetic infant models.</p>

For real portion of the SyRIP dataset, we look for publicly available yet scattered real infant images from sources such as <span id="S3.SS1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">YouTube</span> and <span id="S3.SS1.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Google Images</span>. We follow the convention on working with the publicly available images and each image’s URL link is provided in our dataset. The biggest benefit of this collection method is that the diversity of the infant poses is guaranteed to the greatest extent. We choose infants (newborn to one year old) in various poses and many different backgrounds.</p>

<p id="S3.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">We manually query YouTube and download more than 40 videos with different infants, and then split each video sequence to pick about 12 frames containing different poses. Finally, about 500 images including more than 50 infants with different poses from those frames are collected. We also select about 200 high-resolution images containing more than 90 infants from the Google Images. Compared to images taken from the YouTube videos, images from Google Images with higher resolution can be used to improve the quality of the whole dataset. The pose distribution of the real part of SyRIP dataset is shown in Fig. <a href="#S3.F3" title="Figure 3 ‣ III SyRIP: Synthetic/Real Infant Pose Dataset for Pose Data Augmentation ‣ Invariant Representation Learning for Infant Pose Estimation with Small Data" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a>(b).

We augment the camera parameter with random position with a fixed focal length. For the background, we pick 600 scenarios approximately related to infant indoor and outdoor activities from LSUN dataset <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite>. Unfortunately, SMIL provides only limited appearances and simple pose parameters. There are neither known infant motion capture data nor extra infant appearances for SMIL model. To augment these parameters, we employ references from neighboring domains as following:</p>

Even different in size, infants still share the similar kinematic structure as adults and most adult poses are kinematically compatible with infants. With the same topology as the adult template SMPL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>, many existing adult scans’ textures can be transferred directly into the infant models.
A valid concern could be that with adult’s textures the model will be no infant-like. However, we argue that with limited data, these borrowed variations can prevent overfitting and improve the model robustness. Therefore, we not only utilize the 12 infant textures (naked only with diaper) provided by MINI-RGBD dataset, but also augment appearance with adult textures from 478 male and 452 female clothing images coming from synthetic humans for real (SURREAL) dataset <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>.</p>

<p id="S4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Our FiDIP approach makes use of an initial pose estimation model trained on the abundant adult pose data, then fine-tunes that model on the augmented dataset, which consists of a small amount of real infant pose data and a series of pose-diverse synthetic infant images. For the augmented dataset, a domain adaptation method is proposed to align features of synthetic infant data with the real-world infant images. As the number of images in our dataset is limited, we only update a few layers of that network to fine-tune that for infant pose estimation rather than re-training the whole adult pose estimation network.</p>

The entire model can be treated as two sub-network: pose estimation network and domain confusion network. Pose estimation network could be any pose model including SimpleBaseline <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite>, DarkPose <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite>, and Hourglass <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>. The domain confusion network, which is composed of a feature extractor shared with the pose estimation component and a domain classifier, is added to enforce the images in the real or synthetic domain being mapped into a same feature space after feature extraction. Domain classifier is designed to be a binary classifier with only three fully connected layers to distinguish whether the input feature belongs to a real or synthetic image. In particular, the domain confusion network assists pose estimation network during training. At test time, only the pure pose model (pose estimation network) works independently.</p>

Since the pose estimation network is locked and only domain classifier is to be optimized, the optimization objective in this stage is the loss of domain classifier <math id="S4.SS2.p4.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="L_{D}" display="inline"><semantics id="S4.SS2.p4.1.m1.1a"><msub id="S4.SS2.p4.1.m1.1.1" xref="S4.SS2.p4.1.m1.1.1.cmml"><mi id="S4.SS2.p4.1.m1.1.1.2" xref="S4.SS2.p4.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml">L</mi><mi id="S4.SS2.p4.1.m1.1.1.3" xref="S4.SS2.p4.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml">D</mi></msub><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S4.SS2.p4.1.m1.1b"><apply id="S4.SS2.p4.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS2.p4.1.m1.1.1"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S4.SS2.p4.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS2.p4.1.m1.1.1">subscript</csymbol><ci id="S4.SS2.p4.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S4.SS2.p4.1.m1.1.1.2">𝐿</ci><ci id="S4.SS2.p4.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S4.SS2.p4.1.m1.1.1.3">𝐷</ci></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S4.SS2.p4.1.m1.1c">L_{D}</annotation></semantics></math>, which is calculated by the binary cross entropy:</p>

We try to refine the feature extractor to not only affect the pose predictor but also confuse the domain classifier. We leverage the domain classifier updated at stage I to promote the feature extractor to retain the ability to extract keypoints’ information during the fine-tuning process, but also to ignore the differences between the real domain and the synthetic domain. An adversarial training method, which is proposed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>, is utilized to pushing features from synthetic images and real images into a common domain.

SyRIP dataset includes 700 real infant images with representative poses via manually selection and 1000 synthesized infants. For a reliable evaluation, we keep a large portion, 500 images, of real infant data as test set which we call Test500 for our common test. The rest 200 real with the synthetic infant data is used at the training set.
One observation in our study is that, many pre-trained models are able to accurately estimate infant poses that are similar to adult poses, however not for infant unique poses such as bend legs over the chest.
To evaluate a model’s performance over specific infant poses, we collect a challenging subset with 100 complex yet typical infant poses from Test500 which we call Test100. Some samples are provided in <span id="S5.SS1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Supplementary Materials</span>.</p>

<p id="S5.SS1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">It is clear that the number of images in our test set is much smaller compared to the datasets used in other human pose estimation studies. Indeed, due to the aforementioned limitations caused by privacy, security, and other objective conditions, obtaining sufficient amount of infant pose images (that can publicly get access to) is an ongoing challenge, which makes our application a clear example in “Small Data” domain. We make up for the lack of data scale by enriching the poses, characters, and scenes in our SyRIP dataset.</p>

We add our domain classifier which has 3 fully connected layers on top of the backbone output features. For DarkPose, we choose the highest resolution branch.
During training, we employ Adam optimizer with learning rate of 0.001. The batch size and epoch for initialization session are 128 and 1, respectively. While, for formal training session, there are 100 epochs and 64 images in a batch.

<p id="S5.SS3.p2.1" class="ltx_p">To evaluate SyRIP quality, we employ three SOTA pose estimation models to fine-tune on MINI-RGBD, SyRIP-syn (synthetic portion only) and SyRIP whole set and compare their performance as shown in Table <a href="#S5.T1" title="TABLE I ‣ V-C Evaluation Over SyRIP ‣ V Experimental Evaluation ‣ Invariant Representation Learning for Infant Pose Estimation with Small Data" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">I</span></a>. From the result, we can see that with limited synthesized appearances and limited poses, the model tuned on MINI-RGBD is easily overfitted with even lower performance than the original model. In comparison, in our CDIA approach by extensively learning from neighboring domains, the data variation is increased and even with our synthetic infant data alone, ‘SyRIP-syn’, and without any adaptation, the model performance is still improved.
Additional real infant data as in full SyRIP set, further increase the performance that indicates the benefit of our hybrid strategy.
All these improvements are observed on all tested models with varying computational complexities.</p>

<p id="S5.SS4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">For the infant pose estimation problem, two hypotheses may be assumed: (1) 2D human pose estimation models trained on the large-scale public datasets will be universally effective on different subjects, including infants. (2) If not, they can be fine-tuned with a few samples from the target domain to achieve high performance. In this section, we evaluate these hypotheses by comparing: (a) FiDIP with SOTA pre-trained models; (b) FiDIP ablation study; (c) FiDIP with conventional fine-tuning approach.
For fair comparison, all models are trained on SyRIP if needed and the performance advantage purely comes from the approaches.</p>

Obviously, most models are well-performed on SyRIP Test500, which indicates infant and adult share many common poses. However for infant-specific poses in Test100, their performance drops dramatically as these poses are rarely seen among adults.
In comparison, our approach (FiDIP) shows noticeably better results in both Test100 and Test500. We can see that pre-trained SOTA human pose models are not universally effective and infant pose estimation can be improved significantly via our approach.</p>

<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we present a solution towards robust infant pose estimation, which includes an infant dataset SyRIP with hybrid synthetic and real data and a FiDIP strategy to transfer learn from existing adult models and datasets. Our FiDIP framework consists of a pose estimation sub-network to leverage transfer learning from a pre-trained adult pose estimation network and a domain confusion sub-network for adapting the model to both real infant and synthetic infant datasets. With identical network structure, we compared their performance when trained on our SyRIP dataset and on the only other publicly available infant pose dataset MINI-RGBD respectively to show the benefit of dataset forming strategy with high data scarcity challenge. With identical dataset, we compared FiDIP approach with the fine-tuning approach to show the advantages of FiDIP across multiple pose estimation models with various complexities.</p>
