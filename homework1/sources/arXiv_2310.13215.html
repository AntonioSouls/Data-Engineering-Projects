<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">A fundamental limitation of object detectors is that they suffer from “spatial bias”, and in particular perform less satisfactorily when detecting objects near image borders.
For a long time, there has been a lack of effective ways to measure and identify spatial bias, and little is known about where it comes from and what degree it is.
To this end, we present a new zone evaluation protocol, extending from the traditional evaluation to a more generalized one, which measures the detection performance over zones, yielding a series of Zone Precisions (ZPs).
For the first time, we provide numerical results, showing that the object detectors perform quite unevenly across the zones.
Surprisingly, the detector’s performance in the 96% border zone of the image does not reach the AP value (Average Precision, commonly regarded as the average detection performance in the entire image zone).
To better understand spatial bias, a series of heuristic experiments are conducted.
Our investigation excludes two intuitive conjectures about spatial bias that the object scale and the absolute positions of objects barely influence the spatial bias.
We find that the key lies in the human-imperceptible divergence in data patterns between objects in different zones, thus eventually forming a visible performance gap between the zones.
With these findings, we finally discuss a future direction for object detection, namely, spatial disequilibrium problem, aiming at pursuing a balanced detection ability over the entire image zone.
By broadly evaluating 10 popular object detectors and 5 detection datasets, we shed light on the spatial bias of object detectors.
We hope this work could raise a focus on detection robustness.

While the optimization pipelines of object detectors are well-explored, their behaviors in a local image zone remain a mystery.
The spatial robustness of a detector is especially fundamental <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib60" title="" class="ltx_ref">60</a>]</cite> as objects may appear anywhere and all of them should be detected well.
This is particularly important for some safety applications, e.g., fire/smoke detection <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>, <a href="#bib.bib55" title="" class="ltx_ref">55</a>]</cite>, collision prevention in self-driving cars <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>, and crowd counting and localization <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib79" title="" class="ltx_ref">79</a>, <a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>, <a href="#bib.bib62" title="" class="ltx_ref">62</a>, <a href="#bib.bib58" title="" class="ltx_ref">58</a>]</cite>, where the border zone occupies a large proportion of the image area.</p>

<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Unfortunately, the detectors are in fact unable to perform uniformly across the spatial zones, commonly showing an evident performance drop near the image border.
This phenomenon, which we refer to as “spatial bias”, is a natural obstacle in object detection, yet somehow being ignored for a long time by the detection community.
Some of the recent breakthroughs on spatial robustness of Convolution Neural Networks (CNNs) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib76" title="" class="ltx_ref">76</a>, <a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>,
edging towards that ever-elusive translation invariance,
have their basis for understanding how a small image transformation (e.g. color jitter, translation) does impact classification accuracy.
It has been found that even for the same object, the classifier can make completely different predictions as its spatial position changes <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>]</cite>.
Beyond image classification, we in this work, delve into spatial bias in object detection, shedding light on the limitations of modern object detectors.</p>

<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">It has been an open issue for years that there is a lack of an effective way for measuring and identifying spatial bias.
The traditional evaluation, i.e., AP metric, measures the detection performance over the entire image zone, which provides nothing guided for the spatial robustness of detectors, and one can hardly know where and how much the performance drops.
Therefore, an evaluation protocol is particularly essential as it can help the opportunity better understand the spatial bias and provide tools to further build on methodology.
To this end, we present a systematic way, termed zone evaluation, to analyze whether there is spatial bias in modern object detectors, and if so, how much.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Specifically, we extend the traditional full-map evaluation to a more generalized one.
We calculate the common Average Precision (AP) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib43" title="" class="ltx_ref">43</a>]</cite> within a designated zone, yielding Zone Precision (ZP).
During evaluation, only the boxes whose centers lie in the zone are considered.
With these auxiliary metrics, we for the first time provide the numerical results that explicitly reveal the object detectors are in fact quite spatially biased across the zones.
As shown in Fig. <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ Zone Evaluation: Revealing Spatial Bias in Object Detection" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>,
the ZP gap is 15.4 between the inner zone and the outer one.
Ostensibly, we can infer from this performance gap that the detection ability seems to be highly related to the absolute position of the object.
However, this plausible conjecture has fundamentally many inconsistencies in practice when we shift the object in an image.
We are unaware of any satisfactory explanation for the performance drop in the border zone (see Fig. <a href="#S1.F2" title="Figure 2 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ Zone Evaluation: Revealing Spatial Bias in Object Detection" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>).
Thus, we would like to shed light on the existence and the major source of spatial bias in object detectors.
Finally, we suggest a focus in future object detection research: toward spatial equilibrium.</p>

Our answer is no.
While large objects appear relatively frequently in the central zone, we observe that the zone performance remains quite uneven across different zones when we largely eliminate the effect of object scale.
It is still difficult to forge a necessary connection between spatial bias and object scale.</p>

Our answer is no. The detection performance is barely relevant to the spatial position of objects.
We observe that it can not statistically lead to an increase in detection quality when the objects move to the central zone.</p>

Our analysis reveals strong evidence that spatial bias is highly related to the discrepancy of object data patterns between the zones.
Specifically, there is a distinction in object data patterns between the central objects and the border objects.
As a consequence, an object could be better detected if it is sampled from a central-zone-style data distribution rather than a border-zone-style one.</p>

The work takes a step further and presents a practical issue that urgently needs to be addressed, namely, spatial disequilibrium problem.
In such a problem setting, the object detector incorporates spatial equilibrium as one of the important goals, which has vital significance to robust detection.
Facing this challenge, we also provide our first attempt, spatial equilibrium learning, toward spatial equilibrium object detection.

We provide extensive evaluation and comparison of several representative object detectors.
We reveal through experiments that 1) Spatial bias is quite common in various object detectors and datasets.
2) The spatial equilibria of detectors vary significantly.
In particular, we will show that the sparse detectors perform better in the central zone, while the one-stage dense detectors perform better in the border zone.
3) The proposed spatial equilibrium learning is able to alleviate the spatial disequilibrium problem.</p>

The class imbalance problem naturally causes imbalanced sampling
during training,
hindering the classification performance for those tail classes.
Re-sampling strategies <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>, <a href="#bib.bib48" title="" class="ltx_ref">48</a>]</cite>

This imbalance is also derived from the data itself.
A large number of anchor points are tiled on the background area,

spatial disequilibrium problem shares similar characteristics to class imbalance problem.
The difference is that the latter has a long-tail distribution across classes,

<p id="S2.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">It has been widely discussed that translation invariance is not fully held by deep CNNs <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib76" title="" class="ltx_ref">76</a>, <a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>, <a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>, <a href="#bib.bib69" title="" class="ltx_ref">69</a>]</cite> since they neglect the classical sampling theorem.
A small image transformation could cause dramatic changes in predictions, thereby hindering the robustness of the classifier.
Zhang R. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib76" title="" class="ltx_ref">76</a>]</cite> analyzed the flaws of the max-pooling operator and proposed to inject anti-aliasing for improving the robustness of deep networks.
Lopes et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib47" title="" class="ltx_ref">47</a>]</cite> achieved a better robustness-accuracy trade-off by presenting a patch Gaussian augmentation.</p>

<p id="S2.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Speaking of robustness over longer spatial ranges, recent studies <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite> reveal that CNNs can exploit the absolute positions of objects as additional information for image classification.
Islam et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite> further extended that CNNs encode the position information based on the ordering of the channel dimensions.
In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>, a spatially unbiased StyleGAN2 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite> is proposed to tackle the distorted face generation problem in the image border due to the photographer’s bias in face dataset <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite>.
Gergely et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib60" title="" class="ltx_ref">60</a>]</cite> empirically identified there is a drop in classification accuracy when shifting the image to make the objects closer to the image border.
Islam, M. A. et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite> revealed that there is a boundary effect on semantic segmentation, where the vehicle segmentation quality shows a high correlation to the density of cars in a region.
Manfredi et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib49" title="" class="ltx_ref">49</a>]</cite> proposed a greedy approximation of AP variations by shifting the image by a few pixels to measure the translation equivariance of object detectors, but it inevitably requires several times the inference time to complete the evaluation.
In this work, we numerically quantify the generalization ability of object detectors from the perspective of the local zone for the first time, which helps us better comprehend the existence and the discrete amplitude of spatial bias.
This offers a novel analysis tool for the reliability of object detectors.</p>

For those less requiring box localization, AP<sub id="S3.p4.4.3" class="ltx_sub"><span id="S3.p4.4.3.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">50</span></sub> is good enough.
For example, rotated object detection methods usually report AP<sub id="S3.p4.4.4" class="ltx_sub"><span id="S3.p4.4.4.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">50</span></sub> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib71" title="" class="ltx_ref">71</a>, <a href="#bib.bib72" title="" class="ltx_ref">72</a>, <a href="#bib.bib70" title="" class="ltx_ref">70</a>]</cite>.
Analogous to the AP metric, users can flexibly design various zone partitions based on their own applications.
If the user cares about the comprehensive detection ability for all directions, the annular zone partition would be a good choice.
If the user cares about some regions of interest, the evaluated zones can be customized.
Importantly, as the zone partition holds consistently, the comparison among the detectors stays fair.
This property helps us observe the performance of different detectors in the regions of interest so that we can choose detectors based on practical application needs.
In Sec. <a href="#S6" title="6 Quantitative Evaluation ‣ Zone Evaluation: Revealing Spatial Bias in Object Detection" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">6</span></a>, we will show that the sparse detectors perform better in the central zone, while the one-stage dense detectors perform better in the border zone.</p>

Then, we calculate the mean value of ZP over all the scales, which is shown in Fig. <a href="#S3.F4" title="Figure 4 ‣ 3 Zone Evaluation ‣ Zone Evaluation: Revealing Spatial Bias in Object Detection" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a>.
We observe that the spatial bias is significant no matter how small the range of the object scale is chosen.
The ZP<sup id="S4.SS1.p1.8.1" class="ltx_sup"><span id="S4.SS1.p1.8.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">4,5</span></sup> score continues to be the best and in contrast, the ZP<sup id="S4.SS1.p1.8.2" class="ltx_sup"><span id="S4.SS1.p1.8.2.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">0,1</span></sup> score is the worst.
It shows a steeper drop-off in performance as the evaluation zones get closer to the image border.
One can see that the performance gap between the inner zone and the outer zone is consistently large, with more than 10 ZP gap.
This indicates that the centralized spatial bias is probably not derived from the object scale factor.
For simplicity, we adopt all scales for zone evaluation in the following experiments.</p>

<p id="S4.SS2.p1.6" class="ltx_p">As the zone performance exhibits a clear centralization trend, one straightforward conjecture is that the spatial bias is related to the absolute spatial positions of objects.
The object may be better detected if it is shifted to the central zone, and reversely, be worse if it is in the border zone.
To analyze whether the spatial positions of objects play a key role in their detection quality, we construct the Sudoku-style dataset for object detection of the regularly placed objects on a black <math id="S4.SS2.p1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="600\times 600" display="inline"><semantics id="S4.SS2.p1.1.m1.1a"><mrow id="S4.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1" xref="S4.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml"><mn id="S4.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.2" xref="S4.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml">600</mn><mo lspace="0.222em" rspace="0.222em" id="S4.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.1" xref="S4.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml">×</mo><mn id="S4.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.3" xref="S4.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml">600</mn></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S4.SS2.p1.1.m1.1b"><apply id="S4.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1"><times id="S4.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.1"></times><cn type="integer" id="S4.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S4.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.2">600</cn><cn type="integer" id="S4.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S4.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.3">600</cn></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S4.SS2.p1.1.m1.1c">600\times 600</annotation></semantics></math> image.

This phenomenon is somewhat incompatible with previous observations in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib60" title="" class="ltx_ref">60</a>]</cite>, which analyzes the effect of shifting 100 images and concludes that the detector may have performance drop when the objects close to the image border.
However, when we increase the number of samples up to more than 14K, we observe that shifting objects to the central zone cannot statistically eventuate an increase in detection quality.
Therefore, it is less discernible for the relevance between the centralization tendency of detection performance and the absolute position of objects.</p>

<p id="S4.SS3.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The results are reported in Fig. <a href="#S4.F6" title="Figure 6 ‣ 4.3 Object data patterns between the zones ‣ 4 Delving Deep into Spatial Bias ‣ Zone Evaluation: Revealing Spatial Bias in Object Detection" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">6</span></a>.
For VOC, the train set is VOC 2007 trainval, and the test set is VOC 2007 test.
For COCO, the train set is COCO train2017, and the test set is COCO val2017.
One can see that the objects sampled from the same zone have significantly lower differences than those sampled from different zones.
Specifically, the central objects of the test set are more similar to the central objects of the train set, and the border objects of the test set are more similar to the border objects of the train set.
This indicates that the object data patterns are actually distinct across the zones, and the network is able to capture such deviation.
As illustrated in Fig. <a href="#S4.F7" title="Figure 7 ‣ 4.3 Object data patterns between the zones ‣ 4 Delving Deep into Spatial Bias ‣ Zone Evaluation: Revealing Spatial Bias in Object Detection" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">7</span></a>(a), the zone performance is centralized on VOC 2007 trainval set, thus it naturally inherits the same trend on the test set.
More intriguingly, we further visualize the detection performance on the Sudoku-style dataset in Fig. <a href="#S4.F7" title="Figure 7 ‣ 4.3 Object data patterns between the zones ‣ 4 Delving Deep into Spatial Bias ‣ Zone Evaluation: Revealing Spatial Bias in Object Detection" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">7</span></a>(b-f), where the central objects and the border objects are separated.
It can be seen that the detector can consistently perform better in detecting the central objects no matter where they are.
We notice that this phenomenon holds for all the 5 datasets, including PASCAL VOC, MS COCO, and 3 other application datasets (face mask, fruit, helmet).</p>

<p id="S4.SS3.p3.1" class="ltx_p">The above results confirm the intuition that the objects would be better detected if they are sampled from the central-zone-style data distribution, and be worse if they are sampled from the border-zone-style one.
This shows that when we humans take photos, there is always a divergence in the object data patterns between zones, though it is imperceptible.
When the lens are focused on the regions of interest where objects are most likely to appear, it inevitably leads to a decrease in the sampling frequency of objects in the border zone, resulting in sub-optimal performance.</p>

There are 7 objects of 4 classes, denoted by red cubes. The evaluated zone is set to 4 zones, colored pink, yellow, blue, and green. We simplify the discussion that each object contains only 1 positive sample, and similarly for the case of multiple positives. In the left diagram, the class density is the ratio of the number of objects and the size of prediction maps for each class, whereas, in the right diagram, the object density is the ratio of the number of objects and the size of zones for each zone. The spatial disequilibrium problem is formally equivalent to the class imbalance problem.

Intuitively, higher density indicates more positive samples, thereby generating a larger gradient flow on the zone.
It is analogous to the class imbalance problem which has a long-tail distribution among the classes, as shown in Fig. <a href="#S4.F8" title="Figure 8 ‣ 4.3 Object data patterns between the zones ‣ 4 Delving Deep into Spatial Bias ‣ Zone Evaluation: Revealing Spatial Bias in Object Detection" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">8</span></a>.

Due to that fact, the zone performance may also be correlated to the supervision signal strength in the zone.
A simple approach is to enlarge or reduce the supervision signal strength for the zones so that the network reaches a new convergence state.

One can see that the centralized spatial bias can be further aggravated if we weaken the supervision signals by reducing the number of positive samples in the border zone.
Reversely, we can even achieve an anti-centralized spatial bias if we weaken the supervision signals in the central zone.
This indicates that the supervision signal strength does have an impact on the zone performance.
Given the above analysis, we finally discuss one possible solution for addressing the spatial disequilibrium problem under the annular zone partition.</p>

In this subsection, we introduce a possible solution, termed Spatial Equilibrium Learning as the beginning of relieving the spatial disequilibrium problem.
We first introduce the spatial weight, which maps the anchor point coordinates <math id="S5.SS2.p1.1.m1.2" class="ltx_Math" alttext="(x^{a},y^{a})" display="inline"><semantics id="S5.SS2.p1.1.m1.2a"><mrow id="S5.SS2.p1.1.m1.2.2.2" xref="S5.SS2.p1.1.m1.2.2.3.cmml"><mo stretchy="false" id="S5.SS2.p1.1.m1.2.2.2.3" xref="S5.SS2.p1.1.m1.2.2.3.cmml">(</mo><msup id="S5.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1" xref="S5.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.cmml"><mi id="S5.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.2" xref="S5.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.2.cmml">x</mi><mi id="S5.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.3" xref="S5.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.3.cmml">a</mi></msup><mo id="S5.SS2.p1.1.m1.2.2.2.4" xref="S5.SS2.p1.1.m1.2.2.3.cmml">,</mo><msup id="S5.SS2.p1.1.m1.2.2.2.2" xref="S5.SS2.p1.1.m1.2.2.2.2.cmml"><mi id="S5.SS2.p1.1.m1.2.2.2.2.2" xref="S5.SS2.p1.1.m1.2.2.2.2.2.cmml">y</mi><mi id="S5.SS2.p1.1.m1.2.2.2.2.3" xref="S5.SS2.p1.1.m1.2.2.2.2.3.cmml">a</mi></msup><mo stretchy="false" id="S5.SS2.p1.1.m1.2.2.2.5" xref="S5.SS2.p1.1.m1.2.2.3.cmml">)</mo></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S5.SS2.p1.1.m1.2b"><interval closure="open" id="S5.SS2.p1.1.m1.2.2.3.cmml" xref="S5.SS2.p1.1.m1.2.2.2"><apply id="S5.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S5.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S5.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S5.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1">superscript</csymbol><ci id="S5.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S5.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.2">𝑥</ci><ci id="S5.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S5.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.3">𝑎</ci></apply><apply id="S5.SS2.p1.1.m1.2.2.2.2.cmml" xref="S5.SS2.p1.1.m1.2.2.2.2"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S5.SS2.p1.1.m1.2.2.2.2.1.cmml" xref="S5.SS2.p1.1.m1.2.2.2.2">superscript</csymbol><ci id="S5.SS2.p1.1.m1.2.2.2.2.2.cmml" xref="S5.SS2.p1.1.m1.2.2.2.2.2">𝑦</ci><ci id="S5.SS2.p1.1.m1.2.2.2.2.3.cmml" xref="S5.SS2.p1.1.m1.2.2.2.2.3">𝑎</ci></apply></interval></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S5.SS2.p1.1.m1.2c">(x^{a},y^{a})</annotation></semantics></math> to a scalar <math id="S5.SS2.p1.2.m2.2" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\alpha(x^{a},y^{a})" display="inline"><semantics id="S5.SS2.p1.2.m2.2a"><mrow id="S5.SS2.p1.2.m2.2.2" xref="S5.SS2.p1.2.m2.2.2.cmml"><mi id="S5.SS2.p1.2.m2.2.2.4" xref="S5.SS2.p1.2.m2.2.2.4.cmml">α</mi><mo lspace="0em" rspace="0em" id="S5.SS2.p1.2.m2.2.2.3" xref="S5.SS2.p1.2.m2.2.2.3.cmml">​</mo><mrow id="S5.SS2.p1.2.m2.2.2.2.2" xref="S5.SS2.p1.2.m2.2.2.2.3.cmml"><mo stretchy="false" id="S5.SS2.p1.2.m2.2.2.2.2.3" xref="S5.SS2.p1.2.m2.2.2.2.3.cmml">(</mo><msup id="S5.SS2.p1.2.m2.1.1.1.1.1" xref="S5.SS2.p1.2.m2.1.1.1.1.1.cmml"><mi id="S5.SS2.p1.2.m2.1.1.1.1.1.2" xref="S5.SS2.p1.2.m2.1.1.1.1.1.2.cmml">x</mi><mi id="S5.SS2.p1.2.m2.1.1.1.1.1.3" xref="S5.SS2.p1.2.m2.1.1.1.1.1.3.cmml">a</mi></msup><mo id="S5.SS2.p1.2.m2.2.2.2.2.4" xref="S5.SS2.p1.2.m2.2.2.2.3.cmml">,</mo><msup id="S5.SS2.p1.2.m2.2.2.2.2.2" xref="S5.SS2.p1.2.m2.2.2.2.2.2.cmml"><mi id="S5.SS2.p1.2.m2.2.2.2.2.2.2" xref="S5.SS2.p1.2.m2.2.2.2.2.2.2.cmml">y</mi><mi id="S5.SS2.p1.2.m2.2.2.2.2.2.3" xref="S5.SS2.p1.2.m2.2.2.2.2.2.3.cmml">a</mi></msup><mo stretchy="false" id="S5.SS2.p1.2.m2.2.2.2.2.5" xref="S5.SS2.p1.2.m2.2.2.2.3.cmml">)</mo></mrow></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S5.SS2.p1.2.m2.2b"><apply id="S5.SS2.p1.2.m2.2.2.cmml" xref="S5.SS2.p1.2.m2.2.2"><times id="S5.SS2.p1.2.m2.2.2.3.cmml" xref="S5.SS2.p1.2.m2.2.2.3"></times><ci id="S5.SS2.p1.2.m2.2.2.4.cmml" xref="S5.SS2.p1.2.m2.2.2.4">𝛼</ci><interval closure="open" id="S5.SS2.p1.2.m2.2.2.2.3.cmml" xref="S5.SS2.p1.2.m2.2.2.2.2"><apply id="S5.SS2.p1.2.m2.1.1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S5.SS2.p1.2.m2.1.1.1.1.1"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S5.SS2.p1.2.m2.1.1.1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S5.SS2.p1.2.m2.1.1.1.1.1">superscript</csymbol><ci id="S5.SS2.p1.2.m2.1.1.1.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S5.SS2.p1.2.m2.1.1.1.1.1.2">𝑥</ci><ci id="S5.SS2.p1.2.m2.1.1.1.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S5.SS2.p1.2.m2.1.1.1.1.1.3">𝑎</ci></apply><apply id="S5.SS2.p1.2.m2.2.2.2.2.2.cmml" xref="S5.SS2.p1.2.m2.2.2.2.2.2"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S5.SS2.p1.2.m2.2.2.2.2.2.1.cmml" xref="S5.SS2.p1.2.m2.2.2.2.2.2">superscript</csymbol><ci id="S5.SS2.p1.2.m2.2.2.2.2.2.2.cmml" xref="S5.SS2.p1.2.m2.2.2.2.2.2.2">𝑦</ci><ci id="S5.SS2.p1.2.m2.2.2.2.2.2.3.cmml" xref="S5.SS2.p1.2.m2.2.2.2.2.2.3">𝑎</ci></apply></interval></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S5.SS2.p1.2.m2.2c">\alpha(x^{a},y^{a})</annotation></semantics></math> by</p>

The spatial weight can be easily plugged into the existing detection pipelines with few modifications.
The principle is simple and multi-optional.
Here, we offer two implementations as follows.</p>

In this approach, the key idea is to consider the spatial weight as an additional constraint term when making the criterion rule for label assignment.
Since most of the label assignment algorithms have their own sophisticated implementations, in the following, we provide a specific application description of the classic ATSS <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib77" title="" class="ltx_ref">77</a>]</cite>, simply because of its brevity.

It can be seen that SELA relaxes the positive sample selection conditions for objects near the image borders.
Therefore, more anchor points will be selected as positive samples for them.

There are more potentially promising solutions toward spatial equilibrium that warrant future study.
For example, designing an appropriate data augmentation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib67" title="" class="ltx_ref">67</a>]</cite>, more specifically, increasing data augmentation to make up for the insufficient sampling frequency for the objects near the image borders, might be a promising solution.
Besides, since the spatial disequilibrium problem is formally equivalent to the class imbalance problem, some improved re-balancing methods may also bring gains to spatial equilibrium learning, e.g., class-balanced loss <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>, transfer learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib66" title="" class="ltx_ref">66</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>, and representation learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>, <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>, <a href="#bib.bib46" title="" class="ltx_ref">46</a>]</cite>, etc.
Also, our approaches mainly consider the annular zone partition, which is designed to balance the detection ability between the central zone and the border zone.
For some special applications that care more about some regions of interest, the design ethos can be versatile and contingent on the practical application.</p>

This confirms the existence and universality of spatial bias, and we successfully quantify the defects of object detectors shown in Fig. <a href="#S1.F2" title="Figure 2 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ Zone Evaluation: Revealing Spatial Bias in Object Detection" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a> for the first time.</p>

There is a large gap of 12.9 to 26.9 in ZP variance.
Particularly, we find that the sparse detectors, e.g., DETR series and Sparse R-CNN, tend to produce a large ZP variance, while the one-stage dense object detectors perform better in spatial equilibrium (lower ZP variance).
It shows that the DETR-based detectors do not align with CNN-based detectors in terms of spatial equilibrium.
We conjecture that it may be attributed to the global information captured by the self-attention mechanism.
The sparse detectors first extract features by CNNs and then process the features by a series of attention modules.
The training is more dynamic, and we hypothesize that the central objects may receive more attention.
Clearly, one can conclude that there must be some factors that lead to different spatial equilibria among detectors, including but not limited to the neural network architecture designs, optimization, and training strategies.
Yet currently, we are unaware of which components or algorithm designs have an impact on spatial bias.
We believe that further research on this topic in the future will be interesting, and the study is of great possibility to find the key to addressing the spatial disequilibrium problem.</p>

It can be seen that GFocal (R-50) and DETR (R-50) achieve the same AP score of 40.1.
However, the traditional metrics provide nothing about how much the detection performance is in a zone.

And these performance discrepancies are concealed by the traditional evaluation.
In addition, it is interesting to see that the AP metrics are exactly between ZP<sup id="S6.SS2.p5.11.4" class="ltx_sup"><span id="S6.SS2.p5.11.4.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">3,4</span></sup> and ZP<sup id="S6.SS2.p5.11.5" class="ltx_sup"><span id="S6.SS2.p5.11.5.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">4,5</span></sup>, which indicates that the detection performance in 96% of the image area is actually lower than AP.</p>

The zone evaluation provides a fresh perspective that sheds light on the limitations of object detectors.
It can be seen that spatial bias is also a natural characteristic of object detectors and they are difficult to perform perfect spatial equilibrium for an arbitrary zone partition.
The above results indicate that the ZP variance is a set function related to zone partition.
The annular zone partition mainly considers the balance of detection ability between the inner zone and the outer one, which is a good choice in practice since the centralized photographer’s bias is ubiquitous in visual datasets.
Nevertheless, it should be noted that the zone partition is flexible and is able to be customized to any shape based on the application scenarios.</p>

One may wonder how the performance would go if we directly loose the selection condition for the positive samples without considering their spatial positions.
Here, we conduct an experiment to investigate the effect of the spatial weight.

and more positive samples will be selected without spatial discrimination.
One can see that although the performance is boosted, the variance of the 5 ZPs is large.
This indicates that subtracting a constant from the positive IoU threshold cannot change the sampling frequency much, because more positive samples are generated in the central zone.
In contrast, our SELA can significantly reduce the variance, and achieve a much better spatial equilibrium.</p>

In particular, we reduce the variance by a large margin in terms of ZP.
For example, we successfully lower the variance of ZP by -15.9, -2.5, -1.0, and -22.6 on PASCAL VOC, MS COCO, and face mask/fruit detection.
It demonstrates that our SELA can improve the spatial equilibrium for multiple application scenarios without the sacrifice of AP.</p>

We further provide more experiments to verify the effectiveness of spatial equilibrium learning on various backbone networks.
Table <a href="#S6.T7" title="TABLE VII ‣ 6.4 Evaluation on spatial equilibrium learning ‣ 6 Quantitative Evaluation ‣ Zone Evaluation: Revealing Spatial Bias in Object Detection" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">VII</span></a> exhibits that our SELA can notably improve the spatial equilibrium for all the 3 backbone networks, i.e., lower variance.
We also conduct experiments to check out the generality of spatial equilibrium learning by incorporating it into 3 more detectors, DW <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">38</a>]</cite>, DDOD <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>, and DETR-like detector DINO <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib73" title="" class="ltx_ref">73</a>]</cite>.
Here, we adopt spatial equilibrium loss (SE loss) and we enlarge the training losses for the objects near the image border.

As shown, our method can substantially reduce the ZP variance for the 4 detectors, indicating that a better spatial equilibrium is achieved.
This shows the generalized ability of our method to improve the spatial robustness of detectors without bells and whistles.</p>

We define a finer zone division, which is the same as the division for counting the centers of objects, i.e., <math id="S6.SS4.p6.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="11\times 11" display="inline"><semantics id="S6.SS4.p6.1.m1.1a"><mrow id="S6.SS4.p6.1.m1.1.1" xref="S6.SS4.p6.1.m1.1.1.cmml"><mn id="S6.SS4.p6.1.m1.1.1.2" xref="S6.SS4.p6.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml">11</mn><mo lspace="0.222em" rspace="0.222em" id="S6.SS4.p6.1.m1.1.1.1" xref="S6.SS4.p6.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml">×</mo><mn id="S6.SS4.p6.1.m1.1.1.3" xref="S6.SS4.p6.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml">11</mn></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S6.SS4.p6.1.m1.1b"><apply id="S6.SS4.p6.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S6.SS4.p6.1.m1.1.1"><times id="S6.SS4.p6.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S6.SS4.p6.1.m1.1.1.1"></times><cn type="integer" id="S6.SS4.p6.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S6.SS4.p6.1.m1.1.1.2">11</cn><cn type="integer" id="S6.SS4.p6.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S6.SS4.p6.1.m1.1.1.3">11</cn></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S6.SS4.p6.1.m1.1c">11\times 11</annotation></semantics></math> square zones (see Fig. <a href="#S5.F11" title="Figure 11 ‣ 5.2 Spatial equilibrium learning ‣ 5 Spatial disequilibrium problem ‣ Zone Evaluation: Revealing Spatial Bias in Object Detection" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">11</span></a>).

<div id="S7.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S7.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we present zone evaluation to reveal the existence and the discrete amplitude of spatial bias in modern object detectors.
We find that the spatial bias is less relevant to the object scale and the absolute positions of objects, but closely related to the gap of object data patterns between the zones.
Based on the thorough study of the origin of spatial bias, we finally introduce the spatial disequilibrium problem, aiming at a robust detection across the zones.
We also show a path to spatial equilibrium object detection, as a start to alleviate this problem.
Extensive experiments manifest the existence and the major source of spatial bias, which is prevalent in various modern detectors and datasets.

<p id="S7.p2.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S7.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Significance.</span>
Spatial bias is a natural obstacle in object detection that the detectors usually show a performance drop in the border zone, which occupies a large proportion of the image area.
While the classic AP metric is still considered to be the primary measurement, it is difficult to reveal spatial bias and is challenging to comprehensively reflect the real performance of object detectors.
Maximizing the AP metric does not fully indicate a robust detection and performs well in all zones.
Zone evaluation supplements a series of zone metrics, compensates for the drawbacks of traditional evaluation, and captures more information about detection performance.
We hope this work could inspire the community to rethink the evaluation of object detectors and stimulate further explorations on spatial bias, and the solutions to the spatial disequilibrium problem.</p>

<p id="S7.p4.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S7.p4.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Interpretability of spatial bias in various object detectors.</span>
This paper mainly reveals the existence and the discrete amplitude of spatial bias in object detectors, whereas the specific reason why different detectors perform quite differently is still frozen in the ice.
The neural network architecture designs, pre-training data, optimization, training strategies, and even hyper-parameters may play a role in the spatial bias.
Further exploration to answer the above question is of paramount importance.</p>

<p id="S7.p5.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S7.p5.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">The effect of other potential factors on the spatial bias.</span>
Currently, we pinpointed an evident correlation between imbalanced object distribution and zone performance.
There are some complicated yet implicit factors such as image blur, object occlusion, border effect, noise, etc., that may also contribute to spatial bias.
However, current detection datasets almost lack such annotations for the above factors, making it difficult to establish a quantitative analysis.</p>

<p id="S7.p6.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S7.p6.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Zone evaluation for other vision tasks.</span>
Researchers have found some clues that the image generator may generate distorted content near the image border <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>.
Hence, the spatial bias may also exist in many vision tasks.
Our zone evaluation may have great potential to reveal spatial bias, whether for high-level or low-level vision tasks.</p>
