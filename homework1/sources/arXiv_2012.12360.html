<p id="id6.id1" class="ltx_p">Estimating camera pose from a single image is a fundamental problem in computer vision. Existing methods for solving this task fall into two distinct categories, which we refer to as direct and indirect. Direct methods, such as PoseNet, regress pose from the image as a fixed function, for example using a feed-forward convolutional network. Such methods are desirable because they are deterministic and run in constant time. Indirect methods for pose regression are often non-deterministic, with various external dependencies such as image retrieval and hypothesis sampling. We propose a direct method that takes inspiration from structure-based approaches to incorporate explicit 3D constraints into the network. Our approach maintains the desirable qualities of other direct methods while achieving much lower error in general.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Camera pose estimation is a fundamental task in computer vision. Often this research is referred to as visual localization, or camera relocalization, and refers to estimating the position and orientation of a camera with respect to some predetermined reference frame. Recently, much work has explored learning-based absolute pose regression which directly regresses camera pose using a single forward pass through a neural network. These methods typically use the same basic pipeline: predict a feature embedding using a convolutional neural network (CNN), and then use features from this embedding to regress the camera pose. This works because the weights of the network implicitly capture understanding of the scene. The main differences between methods of this type are choices of feature extraction architecture or loss function. However, absolute pose regression typically performs much worse than more sophisticated alternatives. A recent study by Sattler et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">38</a>]</cite> found that absolute pose regression essentially interpolates between a set of learned basis poses.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In this work we partition methods into one of two classes, direct or indirect. Direct methods determine pose as a fixed pipeline in a deterministic way with no dependency on external steps such as hypothesis sampling, database querying, pose averaging, correspondence matching, or refinement. These methods are typically a single CNN architecture, such as PoseNet <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>, but we show that it is possible to design a more explicit architecture that still resides in the direct pose estimation category. Indirect methods are any method that fall outside of this definition. Examples include structure-based methods such as Active Search <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>]</cite> and DSAC++ <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite> which compute 2D-3D correspondences and require RANSAC and refinement for final pose determination, and retrieval-based methods such as DenseVLAD <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib41" title="" class="ltx_ref">41</a>]</cite> which require a database query.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">An alternate way of thinking about the difference between direct and indirect methods is that direct methods generate pose hypotheses while indirect methods use one or more pose hypotheses for further processing. We believe this is an important distinction because improvements to direct methods can result in improvements in future indirect methods. While the more accurate methods typically fall into the indirect pose estimation category, we believe direct methods are an exciting area and wish to provide a direction for future improvement. Direct pose estimation methods have many practical benefits. Specifically, they perform relocalization in a way that is fast, deterministic, and provide a constant runtime guarantee regardless of scene complexity.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">We propose an approach for solving the direct pose estimation problem using a CNN that bridges the gap between absolute pose regression and structure-based methods. Our approach has several key components. First, given a single RGB image we simultaneously perform scene coordinate regression and monocular depth estimation to extract geometric information from the image. Then, we use the known camera intrinsics to convert the estimated per-pixel depth to 3D camera-frame coordinates, resulting in a set of 3D-3D correspondences. Our approach takes advantage of known geometric constraints to frame the problem as 3D-3D alignment of point clouds, integrating a differentiable singular value decomposition (SVD) layer with a learned per-pixel weighting scheme to compute the final camera pose.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">We evaluate our method both quantitatively and qualitatively through a variety of experiments using well-known benchmark datasets. Compared to existing direct pose estimation methods, we significantly advance the state-of-the-art and decrease the gap to indirect methods.</p>

<div id="S2.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Directly estimating camera pose from an image using convolutional neural networks began with the introduction of PoseNet <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>. This style of approach which computes pose as the output of a CNN is known as absolute pose regression. Absolute pose regression differs significantly from traditional methods in that it does not require explicit image-level or pixel-level correspondences. Many works have explored the application of CNNs to this problem, but differences lie largely in changes to the underlying feature extraction architecture or modified objective functions <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>, <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>, <a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>, <a href="#bib.bib44" title="" class="ltx_ref">44</a>]</cite>. Another common approach is to add relative pose constraints on pairs of images during training instead of only absolute pose <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib47" title="" class="ltx_ref">47</a>]</cite>. In general, this class of methods is attractive due to their simplicity and moderate performance, but are far from the most accurate approaches in terms of pose accuracy. Sattler et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">38</a>]</cite> provide an in depth review of existing work in absolute pose regression, with comparisons to more accurate structure-based and image retrieval methods.</p>

<div id="S2.SS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Relative pose estimation approaches predict the pose of a query image relative to a set of database images with known pose. RelocNet <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite> uses a method for camera pose retrieval using nearest neighbors with learned features. Similarly, CamNet <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite> uses coarse-to-fine retrieval with two rounds of retrieval and pose refinement. AnchorNet <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>]</cite> uses a set of spatial anchors, and the final pose estimate is computed by a weighted average of predicted offsets from the anchors. This method is different from others of this style in that reference poses for relative pose estimation are not based on retrieval, but rather embedded into the network either prior to or during training. The analogue to retrieval in this scenario is a set of anchor point scores, which define the weights for averaging all pose hypotheses.</p>

<div id="S2.SS2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Recent work has explored the problem of estimating the 3D location of image pixels in the scene’s coordinate frame, known as scene coordinate regression. Unlike camera pose, scene coordinate information is often explicit in the image content, as points in space often look similar from varying viewpoints. Early work showed that scene coordinates could accurately be computed from RGB-D imagery in small indoor scenes using random forests <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">39</a>]</cite>. Later, random forests were replaced with CNNs that only require RGB imagery without depth information <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Other methods combine image retrieval and scene coordinate regression. SANet <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib48" title="" class="ltx_ref">48</a>]</cite> retrieves a set of images to construct a local 3D point cloud that is used for scene coordinate regression. Perspective-n-Learned-Point <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite> uses image retrieval to find a single nearby image for stereo depth estimation. CNN features are used for computing pixel correspondences which, along with the stereo depth and known pose of the retrieved image, result in a set of 2D-3D correspondences.</p>

<div id="S2.SS2.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">From scene coordinates, the camera pose can be computed using perspective-n-point <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite> (PnP) methods that use the 2D pixel and 3D scene coordinate correspondences to triangulate the position and orientation of the camera. While these methods produce highly accurate results, they are sensitive to noise and require the use of a robust estimator, such as RANSAC <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>, and hypothesis refinement to achieve high accuracy. Though there is active research exploring the use of neural networks for generating samples for pose hypotheses, e.g., NG-RANSAC <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>, our goal is to avoid this step altogether. Dang et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite> proposed an accurate alternative to RANSAC that predicts correspondence weighting using a CNN. However, the method of Dang et al. only works on a very specific type of problem that is solved by finding the minimum eigenvector of a matrix. There has been work on estimating point weights specifically for scene coordinate regression and pose estimation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>, but accurate results still require RANSAC.</p>

Our approach is implemented as a sequence of differentiable neural network layers, enabling end-to-end optimization, deterministic inference, and a simple implementation.

Motion towards the camera reduces the contribution of that point to the singular vectors. Likewise, motion away from the camera increases the contribution of that point. This allows for more robustness to noise without the need for hard thresholding or sampling. To generate the weights, we pass the correspondences through a scoring CNN that produces a per-pixel weighting. The input to this network is the concatenation of the output scene coordinates and unprojected camera frame coordinates computed from the output depth. The weighting is vital because the accuracy of the point cloud centroid depends on the accuracy of the points themselves. Since the estimated rotation is dependent on accurate centroid subtraction, and the estimated translation is dependent on <span id="S3.SS3.p5.2.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">both</span> the centroid and rotation estimate, it is important to reduce the impact of the noisy points.</p>

<p id="S4.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We report results on two common benchmark datasets. The 7Scenes dataset is a collection of 7 unique indoor scenes of varying size and localization difficulty. Each scene has a set of sequences containing 500 or 1000 frames of RGB, depth, and pose information resulting in 1000 to 7000 frames for training. The 12Scenes <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib43" title="" class="ltx_ref">43</a>]</cite> dataset is a more difficult indoor dataset for absolute pose regression. It contains few training images relative to the size of the space for each scene which makes training accurate absolute pose regression models difficult, whereas structure-based methods perform very well on this dataset. For each scene in these datasets, ground-truth depth labels are found by ray-casting into structure-from-motion models using the ground-truth pose information. The pose and depth labels are used for computing ground-truth scene coordinates. Please see the supplemental material for additional results on these datasets as well as results on outdoor scenes.</p>

Surprisingly, the outputs prior to this stage are reasonable.

While performance is similar, we found that training without the validity mask results in improved performance in most cases. An interesting result to note is that when training with the loss mask it is possible to get results on par with, and in many cases much better than, many other direct pose estimation methods from Table <a href="#S3.T1" title="Table 1 ‣ 3.4 Implementation Details ‣ 3 Method ‣ A Structure-Aware Method for Direct Pose Estimation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a> even without correspondence weighting. Performance in this case is better than in the case of not using a validity mask during training due to the mean subtraction of the point clouds in the alignment phase. The unmasked loss results in zeros being predicted, which while they can be easily detected and ignored by the correspondence weighting CNN, negatively effect the point cloud centroids. On the other hand, loss masking prevents zero values from being predicted. Though error still decreases in this case with the use of the predicted weights.</p>

Overall, it appears that the weighting is learning to recognize regions which are inconsistent with the rest of the point clouds. This is apparent as the output weights are often similar and opposite to the endpoint error after applying the pose. For example, the second row shows an example where the predicted scene coordinates are accurate, but the depth prediction is incorrect. This is correctly captured in the weighting network. The bottom row shows a difficult failure case. The depth estimates are reasonable, but the high noise present in the scene coordinates confuses the weighting network, leading to an incorrect pose.</p>

<div id="S5.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">While it is uncertain in general how exactly CNNs see depth in monocular images <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>, it is clear in our case that both the depth and scene coordinate networks are effectively memorizing scene layout and geometry. Luckily, in the case of single image localization, this is precisely what is desired. This type of memorization, unlike PoseNet, works well for pose estimation because the memorized objects have semantic and structural meaning. Instead of interpolating between a set of learned poses, we are able to exploit the high capacity of the network to effectively store two 3D copies of the scene which can then be recalled and used for pose estimation.</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p2.1" class="ltx_p">We believe this is advantageous over the less explicit PoseNet approaches for several reasons. First, as we have shown, this allows for much lower error in general across a wide variety of scenes. Second, this allows for explainable pose estimation. For PoseNet-style methods, it is difficult to quantify what about an image makes it difficult for pose regression. On the other hand, the intermediate outputs of our method allow for explicit evaluation of geometric consistency. We believe this added benefit of explainability will be useful for investigating the shortcomings of direct pose estimation, leading to better architecture and optimization design choices.</p>

<div id="S6.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We presented a pose estimation approach that has many of the desirable properties of PoseNet-style approaches in that it is fully differentiable, uses only feed-forward processing, and has a constant runtime, but significantly improved accuracy. Unlike PoseNet, which uses a generic CNN to perform pose estimation, our approach is composed of modules with specific geometric functions. This means that our method is not only more accurate, but it is also easier to understand when it fails. While our approach has not achieved the accuracy of the state-of-the-art indirect pose estimation methods, it begins to close the performance gap.</p>

Compared to the 7Scenes dataset, it is less common for images to contain large regions that have no depth information during training. As such, the weighting CNN produces more varied weights in general because it can no longer depend on obviously incorrect points. This can result in seemingly strange results, such as row 5 in Figure <a href="#S10.F6" title="Figure 6 ‣ 10 Architecture Details ‣ A Structure-Aware Method for Direct Pose Estimation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">6</span></a> and row 12 in Figure <a href="#S10.F7" title="Figure 7 ‣ 10 Architecture Details ‣ A Structure-Aware Method for Direct Pose Estimation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">7</span></a>.

On average our method is best for position error, but the ResNet based PoseNet <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite> performs best on orientation error. This is surprising since PoseNet was not competitive even against other similar methods on 7Scenes. This shows the difficulty of this dataset for direct pose estimation methods. Note that this is among the most challenging scenarios for our method because of the poor quality of the depth labels generated from rendering from sparse structure-from-motion (SfM) keypoints. Due to the explicit nature of our method, utilizing a better SfM tool to generate more accurate depth images will directly lead to better performance. Examples of depth labels found in the dataset are shown in Figure <a href="#S10.F8" title="Figure 8 ‣ 10 Architecture Details ‣ A Structure-Aware Method for Direct Pose Estimation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">8</span></a>. While there are many areas that have missing depth (depth=0), this is not an issue for our method as we can ignore these pixels during training. However, there are a large number of sky pixels which are incorrectly labeled with depth, as well as erroneous depth values in general. These errors are an issue for our method because they result in incorrect supervision during training. However, as mentioned earlier, even with these labels our method performs well, and there is a clear path to improvement from better label generation alone.</p>

Notice that even in areas where depth and scene coordinate predictions seem good, the predicted weights tend to focus on a smaller area. This is apparent mostly in the Kings College scene, examples of which are shown in rows 2 and 8. Also, in row 6 we can see a difficult case where most of the image is a tree, leading to bad predictions. This is reflected in the weights as all predicted correspondence weights for this example are very low. Overall, even with the noisy depth labels, the weighting mechanism is able to capture which points are more reliable for final pose computation.</p>

<p id="S9.p1.1" class="ltx_p">A key part of our method is the choice of depth estimation network. While we could have chosen a large network and trained it for generic depth estimation, we instead chose a more shallow network and trained on a per-scene basis for pose estimation. Table <a href="#S10.T7" title="Table 7 ‣ 10 Architecture Details ‣ A Structure-Aware Method for Direct Pose Estimation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">7</span></a> shows the average depth error for each scene. We compare the depth estimation accuracy in the case of 1) training with a single scene, 2) training with all scenes, and 3) holding out the scene. This last case tests the potential ability of our depth networks to transfer to other scenes. We report mean absolute error, as well as depth accuracy values for different error thresholds. As expected, we typically observe a gradual decline in depth estimation quality as we move from the single scene case where much of the scene structure can be memorized, to the held out case, where no information about the scene was observed during training. Also, we show that a high percentage of pixels have a depth error of less than 0.125 meters, so we believe our simple network is sufficient for this task.</p>
