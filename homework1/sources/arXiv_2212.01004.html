<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Smart retail stores are becoming the fact of our lives. Several computer vision and sensor based systems are working together to achieve such a complex and automated operation. Besides, the retail sector already has several open and challenging problems which can be solved by the help of pattern recognition and computer vision methods. One important problem to be tackled is the planogram compliance control. Planogram is the diagram showing placement of products in shelves of a retail store. Usage of the planogram aims to improve sales by displaying products in a way that inspires the customer to purchase them. The suppliers also pay for the shelves with high selling potential. Or, they apply discounts to their products to be able to place them to these shelves. The planogram also ensures consistency between branches of the same retail store.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Although planogram usage has such benefits, placement of the products on a shelf may not comply with it. A shelf is considered planogram compliant when all the products on it are in the right place and quantity. However, this may not be satisfied due to several reasons. The products can be misplaced by human error, low on stock or out-of-stock. These situations not only result in loss of sales to the retailer, they also cause the retailer to pay penalty fees to the supplier. According to Shapiro <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>, the planogram compliance ratio is only 70% on average in an average retail store. This results huge sale losses for the retailer. According to the same study, resetting planogram, which is re-allocating all the products, can improve the sales up to 7.8% in two weeks. Therefore, retailers must continuously organize the shelves in compliant with the planogram to maximize overall sales. In order to explain the planogram compliance problem further, we provide a sample visual representation of the planogram and corresponding two shelf images in Fig. <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ Planogram Compliance Control via Object Detection, Sequence Alignment, and Focused Iterative Search" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>.</p>

<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">We provide visual representation of the planogram for a shelf in Fig. <a href="#S1.F1.sf1" title="In Figure 1 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ Planogram Compliance Control via Object Detection, Sequence Alignment, and Focused Iterative Search" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1(a)</span></a>. This is the reference planogram which shows how the products should be placed. In this planogram, there are five different products with a total of 19 items in them. Images for these items have been collected from the web such that they have high resolution. We provide a shelf image, taken by camera, fully compliant with the reference planogram in Fig. <a href="#S1.F1.sf2" title="In Figure 1 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ Planogram Compliance Control via Object Detection, Sequence Alignment, and Focused Iterative Search" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1(b)</span></a>. As can be seen here, although the order and number of the items on the shelf are the same as the reference planogram, objects on the shelf have different viewing angle and non-ideal placement. Besides, there are differences in product images of the planogram and fully compliant shelf in terms of brightness and color. We next provide a shelf image, taken by camera, partially compliant with the reference planogram in Fig. <a href="#S1.F1.sf3" title="In Figure 1 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ Planogram Compliance Control via Object Detection, Sequence Alignment, and Focused Iterative Search" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1(c)</span></a>. This image represents most of the planogram compliance problems. We can count them as follows. There is an extra item placed on the leftmost part of the shelf. Hence, all other items are right shifted accordingly. The third product group has one extra item in it. The fourth product group has two less items in it. The fifth product group has one less item in it. There is an empty slot between the fourth and fifth product groups. There is no way we can determine the product this empty slot belongs to. The sixth product group has items resembling actual items, but they are different. Therefore, the partially planogram compliant shelf image in Fig. <a href="#S1.F1.sf3" title="In Figure 1 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ Planogram Compliance Control via Object Detection, Sequence Alignment, and Focused Iterative Search" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1(c)</span></a> gives information on the challenges we can face on the planogram compliance control.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Planogram compliance control is conventionally performed manually by an employee in retail stores. The employee walks around aisles and controls shelves once or twice a day for their compliance to the planogram. If the employee detects a problem, then the products on the shelf are re-arranged according to the planogram. However, this method is labor intensive and prone to human error. In an alternative approach, the employee uses a mobile device to take photos of shelves <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>. Then, these photos are sent to cloud to check the shelf status. Even though this method eliminates the human error, it is still labor intensive. Another method in the planogram compliance control is using fixed IP cameras instead of mobile devices. Unfortunately, using multiple cameras increases the cost <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>. One recent approach in the planogram compliance control is using robots <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>. In these systems, the mobile robot moves around aisles of the store and collects images and data from the shelves using onboard cameras and sensors. As the robot knows the exact location of itself in the store, it can perform the planogram compliance control. Unfortunately, these systems are fairly expensive.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">There are several methods in literature based on computer vision and pattern recognition to solve the planogram compliance control and object detection from shelf images. Tonioni and Di Stefano <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite> proposed a method to solve the problem in three steps. First, they detect objects from the shelf image via generalized Hough transform and local feature extraction. Second, they use sub-graph matching to compare the reference planogram and actual item placements. Third, they apply an iterative approach to locate the undetected objects. Our proposed method differs from Tonioni and Di Stefano’s work in the second and third steps. Liu <em id="S1.p5.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">et al.</em> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite> provided a planogram compliance control method based on repetitive image patterns. They did not provide an object detection step in their study. There are also related studies focusing on object detection in retail environment. George and Floerkemeier <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite> formed discriminative random forests via all product images. They used SIFT with only one training image per product for image classification. Then, they use deformable dense pixel matching and genetic algorithm optimization. George and Floerkemeier did not provide a planogram compliance control step. Instead, they focused on multi-instance object detection in retail stores. Rosado <em id="S1.p5.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">et al.</em> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite> used panoramic images to locate stocked out products in shelves without object detection. Jund <em id="S1.p5.1.3" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">et al.</em> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite> used CNN to recognize products on the shelf. Unfortunately, CNN needs several images from the same product type for training. Franco <em id="S1.p5.1.4" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">et al.</em> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite> first extracted corners from the shelf image. They assumed that each corner is a candidate for being a member of a rectangular object. Then, they formed a window and compared histograms to check whether there is an object there. Afterward, they benefit from CNN for fine selection. Karlinsky <em id="S1.p5.1.5" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">et al.</em> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite> first extracted global information such as location of the shelf. Then, they proposed three methods as local feature extraction (via SURF) and implicit shape model usage, histogram of oriented gradients feature extraction and sliding window usage, and local feature extraction (via SURF) and bag of words usage. Their first and third approaches are similar to the object detection step proposed in this study. However, Karlinsky <em id="S1.p5.1.6" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">et al.</em> did not consider planogram compliance control in their method. This is the main difference between both studies. Santra <em id="S1.p5.1.7" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">et al.</em> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite> used both object and part level features to detect fine-grained objects in the shelf image. They proposed a reconstruction-classification network to find object level features. Then, they used BRISK to find keypoints on the product image. They encoded the last level of CNN with the convolutional LSTM to describe the part level feature at each keypoint. Finally, they used both object and part level features to detect fine-grained objects. There are two related studies on detecting objects from densely packed images such as acquired from shelves in retail stores. However, the aim is not object recognition in them. The first study is proposed by Goldman <em id="S1.p5.1.8" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">et al.</em> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite> which introduces the SKU100k dataset. It uses different deep learning models on the dataset to detect objects. The second study is proposed by Ye <em id="S1.p5.1.9" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">et al.</em> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite> which uses the same dataset on different deep learning models for object detection. There is also a recent review paper by Santra and Mukherjee <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>. The reader can check it for both traditional and deep learning methods for automatic identification of products in retail stores.</p>

<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">In this study, we propose a novel method to detect objects from densely packed shelf images and control planogram compliance. The object detection step depends on local feature extraction and implicit shape model representation. Planogram compliance control step is based on the modified Needleman-Wunsch algorithm which is introduced to align DNA sequences. We also introduce a focused and iterative search step to improve the object detection and planogram compliance control steps. These three steps differ from the ones in literature such that they improve both object detection from shelf images and planogram compliance control sequentially.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p7" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p7.1" class="ltx_p">The layout of the study is as follows. We first introduce the parts of the object detection step in the proposed method. Therefore, we start with local feature extraction and their representation. Afterward, we explain how brute force search and implicit shape model can be used to detect object center points in a given shelf image. Then, we introduce a bounding box extraction method based on this information. We next explain the planogram compliance control step of the proposed study. To do so, we start with representing the extracted object information as an abstract planogram. Afterward, we introduce the modified Needleman-Wunsch algorithm for planogram compliance control. Then, we explain the focused and iterative search step to improve the performance of the proposed method. We next test the proposed method on two different datasets for the object detection and planogram compliance control steps. Finally, we summarize key findings of the proposed method.</p>

<div id="S2.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Objects on a retail shelf generally have complex front views. Moreover, there are several nearby objects with almost the same or similar views. Extracting local features and forming an object detection framework using them is more promising compared to using global features. Therefore, we picked five well-known local feature extraction methods as SIFT <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>, SURF <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>, ORB <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>, AKAZE <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>, and BRISK <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>.

Here, we benefit from different distance metrics for different local feature vector types. To be more specific, we use the Euclidean distance for SIFT and SURF since they have float values in their feature vectors. We use the Hamming distance for BRISK, ORB, and AKAZE since they have binary values in their feature vectors.</p>

The aim of this test is to eliminate features that are not distinct enough even though the distance between them may be below a given threshold. We also use the ratio test to keep only strong matches not only for SIFT, but also for all considered local feature extraction methods. Therefore, we calculate the ratio as</p>

Agglomerative clustering requires multiple training objects to group similar image patches and clustering their features. Besides, it has a high computation cost. We have only one representative image for each object in our problem. Therefore, we use only local features and keypoints to create a voting matrix in ISM.

<p id="S2.SS5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">As we detect possible object center locations in the shelf image, the next step is forming a bounding box for each location. We have the bounding box representation for the object in the planogram image. We know the ratio of planogram object size wrt the shelf image. Hence, we can form the bounding box for the detected object in the shelf image directly. In this implementation, the detected object in the shelf may not have a rectangular shape. It may be shifted or rotated. Therefore, the object in the shelf image may be taken as smaller or larger than the planogram image. To handle this issue, we add a 20% overlap tolerance in all operations.</p>

<p id="S2.SS5.p5.3" class="ltx_p">Some bounding boxes may overlap. This means that there are more than one candidate object in the given location. We should eliminate weak candidates. To do so, we check the intersection over union (IoU) of all bounding boxes <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite>.

There may also be empty spaces or undetected (unknown) objects in the image. We should analyze these locations as well. Therefore, we next search for empty spaces in the shelf image after detecting all bounding boxes corresponding to the detected objects. To do so, we model the empty space as a black box since it will be dark compared to its surrounding. Then, we apply template matching. We then merge the detected neighboring empty space blocks. As for discriminating the empty space blocks and undetected objects, we first obtain the average width of detected objects in the shelf image. Here, we assume that the undetected object will have similar width as its neighboring objects. If the merged empty space block width is the same or larger than this width, then we label that region as empty space. If we neither detect the object nor an empty space in a part of the shelf image, then we label that region as unknown.</p>

Unfortunately, direct comparison does not work since there can be unknown, extra or missing objects on the shelf. Moreover, we may not know their quantity and location. Therefore, we propose using the Needleman-Wunsch (NW) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite> algorithm introduced for aligning two DNA sequences.

<p id="S3.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The NW algorithm uses dynamic programming to align two sequences by using a score matrix. In it, columns and rows represent the two DNA sequences to be aligned. The NW algorithm systematically fills the matrix using a substitution score and gap penalty. In other words, the substitution score and gap penalty are used to calculate the score value to be added to the score matrix for the compared element pair of two sequences. Hence, the score matrix keeps the score obtained by comparing all the elements of two sequences with each other.</p>

Therefore, we increase the importance of the detected and undetected object numbers. Hence, non-aligned one and ten objects will have different values. We had to define two different gap penalty values for the insert and delete operations. The gap penalty for the delete operation is set as the required number of objects in the reference planogram since we could not detect them. The gap penalty for the insert operation is set as the number of extra items in the detected planogram. The aim here is that the more inserted such false objects are, the more penalty there should be.</p>

<p id="S3.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The object detection method and modified NW algorithm introduced in the previous sections may not produce exact planogram alignment result in one iteration. In other words, some of the objects may not be detected or falsely detected in the planogram in one iteration. This is the case most of the times for the planogram compliance control problem since we have only one training image per object. Therefore, we propose a focused and iterative search method to improve the results.</p>

As can be seen in this table, the focused and iterative search method led to detecting all known objects in the shelf image. Hence, the alignment result became the same as the ground truth (GT) as expected. Based on the iteration stopping conditions, we did not resemble the unknown objects at the leftmost and rightmost sections of the planogram to an expected object in the reference planogram. In other words, the threshold values have not been relaxed automatically in the focused and iterative search method to provide false results.</p>

<div id="S4.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We test the proposed method in this section. To do so, we benefit from two datasets. We first introduce them. Then, we provide the object detection performance for the proposed method on these datasets. Afterward, we provide experimental results on the planogram compliance control step. Moreover, we provide sample results of the proposed method.</p>

<div id="S4.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">There are several datasets available in literature for similar problems as object detection in retail stores, densely packed object detection, and bounding box extraction. However, they are not suitable for planogram compliance control for the following reasons. First, they do not have the category and annotation information for the objects in the database. Second, they do not provide the reference planogram for the shelves in the database. Therefore, we are left with the Grozi - grocery dataset provided by George and Floerkemeier <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>. Tonioni and Di Stefano <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite> manually annotated a subset of the images (consisting of 922 objects) in the Grozi dataset with item-specific bounding boxes. We use these annotations in evaluating our method. Moreover, we were able to compare our object detection performance with theirs.</p>
</div>
<div id="S4.SS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">We also formed our own dataset from the conventional grocery store Migros, Turkey and conducted experiments using it. Images in this dataset are acquired by a Samsung S10 Plus mobile phone with a 16 MP ultra-wide camera. Our dataset is composed of five distinct subsets. The first subset is composed of 14 shelf images to test the performance of the proposed method. We crop these images such that each has only one row of objects. Hence, the total number of images became 28 with 312 objects in them. We also obtain a high resolution image of each object from the web to form the reference planogram. Then, we annotate all the objects in the acquired shelf images. The second subset is composed of 14 shelf images with 124 objects in them. Among these, 64 objects are occluded. Therefore, this subset is specific to test the performance of the proposed method on occluded objects on the shelf. The third subset is composed of 15 images, acquired from five shelves with three different viewing angles, with 75 objects in them. Hence, this subset is specific to test the performance of the proposed method on different viewing angles for the shelf. The fourth subset is composed of 48 objects placed on top of each other. Therefore, it is specific to test the performance of the proposed method on the objects placed on top of each other. We call the combination of all these distinct subsets as the Migros dataset in the following sections. We will publicize this dataset in a Github repository if the manuscript is accepted for publication. Hence, other researchers can test and compare their methods with this study on the same basis.</p>

<div id="S4.SS2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We focus on object detection performance of the proposed method in this section. Here, we assess the object detection as positive when the IoU between the detected and ground-truth bounding boxes is greater than 25%. We mark the result as true if the detected and ground-truth objects are the same. Otherwise, we mark it as false. We also count undetected bounding boxes of ground-truth as false negatives. Then, we compute the precision, recall, and F1 score as our performance metrics.</p>
</div>
<div id="S4.SS2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">We provide object detection performance of the proposed method on the first subset of the Migros dataset without the focused and iterative search step as a baseline. We provide the obtained results in Table <a href="#S4.T8" title="Table 8 ‣ 4.2 Object Detection Performance: The General Case ‣ 4 Experiments ‣ Planogram Compliance Control via Object Detection, Sequence Alignment, and Focused Iterative Search" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">8</span></a>. As can be seen in this table, the proposed method has a precision higher than 0.9 for all feature extraction methods considered. Therefore, true detection of the correct objects is higher than 90% and false positive rates are low. The main reason for this result is that we search specific objects in the given shelf image. Hence, it can be detected with high precision if present in the image. All feature extraction methods considered in this study provide recall rates around or higher than 0.9. This indicates that if an object is present in the shelf image, then it can be detected. The missing objects are either occluded or have unexpected face views. The main reason for not detecting such images is that we only have one reference image per object type in our planogram. Finally, the F1 score for all the considered feature extraction methods is around 0.90. This is a high value. Unfortunately, it was not possible to compare this value with manual object detection by a store employee. However, we believe that such a score could not be obtained since the employee should spent time and focus on checking the correctness of the objects on the shelf. Therefore, we expect a high recall value and low precision. Hence, the F1 score will be low.</p>

To be more specific, decreasing the threshold values iteratively leads to higher recall rates. Besides, the focused and iterative search method also decreases false detections in the previous steps. This increases precision values. Therefore, we can reach F1 scores around 0.98. This is a remarkable result for the given problem.</p>

As can be seen in this table, F1 scores obtained by different local feature extraction methods decrease compared to the Migros dataset. Lower F1 scores in the Grozi dataset are because of two main reasons. First, images in this dataset are blurry and have low resolution. Second, the proposed method is sensitive to the shelf height and full visibility of the shelf. There are some images in the Grozi dataset which violate this constraint. Therefore, they led to low performance. Even with these negative effects, the proposed method was able to produce F1 scores around 0.96.</p>

<div id="S4.SS6.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this section, we consider performance of the proposed method on the planogram compliance control step. To do so, we benefit from the first subset of the Migros dataset and Grozi dataset. For the Migros dataset, we asked the responsible department from Migros to generate the corresponding reference planogram for the shelf images considered. For the Grozi dataset, we benefit from the method proposed by Tonioni and Di Stefano <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>. Hence, we converted their graph based representation to our format as ground truth. Then, we provide the planogram compliance control performance on the dataset.</p>
</div>
<div id="S4.SS6.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS6.p2.1" class="ltx_p">There is no consensus on measuring the planogram compliance control performance in literature. The closest study for this purpose is by Liu <em id="S4.SS6.p2.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">et al.</em> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>. Unfortunately, this study focuses on a graph theory based representation. Therefore, we provide our own measures based on precision, recall, and F1 score values. For the planogram compliance control, we calculate these values as follows. We assess the alignment result as true positive if it is the same as ground truth for an object group. Otherwise, we mark it as false positive. We assess the result as false positive if we find an alignment result for an object group that is not in ground truth. We assess the alignment result as false negative if there is an object group in ground truth but not in the alignment result.</p>

As can be seen in this table, SIFT and AKAZE have higher F1 scores compared to other local feature extraction methods. SURF and BRISK have similar and average results. ORB performs below average compared to other methods. We can also consider Table <a href="#S4.T14" title="Table 14 ‣ 4.6 Planogram Compliance Control Performance ‣ 4 Experiments ‣ Planogram Compliance Control via Object Detection, Sequence Alignment, and Focused Iterative Search" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">14</span></a> from a general perspective. The most important observation here is that the planogram compliance control performance is directly related to the object detection performance given in Table <a href="#S4.T9" title="Table 9 ‣ 4.2 Object Detection Performance: The General Case ‣ 4 Experiments ‣ Planogram Compliance Control via Object Detection, Sequence Alignment, and Focused Iterative Search" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">9</span></a>. This can be expected since correctly detecting objects in the shelf image directly affects the corresponding planogram formation from the shelf.</p>

The precision values are lower than recall in both tables. This indicates that we have less number of false negatives. In other words, the proposed method was able to detect most of the ground truth objects in the given image. Unfortunately, we have high false positives ar the same time. Therefore, we have relatively low precision values in both tables.</p>

<div id="S5.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Planogram compliance control is an important problem in retail sector. In this study, we propose a solution to this problem via pattern recognition and computer vision tools. Our aim is to detect objects in shelf images and check their placement wrt the corresponding reference planogram at hand. This problem is slightly different from the usual object detection applications. The main reason is that, we have the reference planogram such that we know where to find a target object. However, this information may be faulty due to several reasons as follows. There may be missing or extra objects on the shelf different from the ones in the planogram. Some objects may be occluded or placed backward on the shelf. Moreover, planogram compliance control requires relative placement of the objects as well as their number on the shelf. Therefore, we proposed a novel method different from the available ones in literature. Our novelty comes in three different steps. First, we modified and enhanced the ISM for object detection and boundary extraction from the shelf image. Second, we modified the NW algorithm for planogram compliance control. Third, we introduced an iterative and focused search to improve the object detection and planogram compliance control steps. Therefore, the proposed method is based on object detection, alignment, and focused iterative search. We tested these three steps on different datasets and tabulated their performance. While doing so, we picked challenging scenarios as occlusion, different viewing angles, and objects placed on top of each other. We also compared the proposed method with a similar one in literature on the same dataset. We discussed the obtained results to indicate the strengths and weaknesses of our method. Based on these, we can claim that the proposed method can be used in retail sector and smart retail stores with confidence. The next step for us is extending our method to run on low power embedded systems. Hence, it can be used in stand alone form in retail sector.</p>
