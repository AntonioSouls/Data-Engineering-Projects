<p id="id10.id1" class="ltx_p">Detecting human-object interactions (HOIs) is a challenging problem in computer vision. Existing techniques for HOI detection heavily rely on appearance-based features, which may not capture other essential characteristics for accurate detection. Furthermore, the use of transformer-based models for sentiment representation of human-object pairs can be computationally expensive. To address these challenges, we propose a novel graph-based approach, TMHOI (Translational Moddel for Human-Object Interaction Detection), that effectively captures the sentiment representation of HOIs by integrating both spatial and semantic knowledge. In a graph, TMHOI takes the components of interaction as nodes, and the spatial relationships between them as edges. Our approach employs a spatial encoder and a semantic encoder to extract spatial and semantic information, respectively, and then combines these encodings to create a knowledge graph that captures the sentiment representation of HOIs. Compared to existing techniques, TMHOI is computationally efficient and allows for the incorporation of prior knowledge, making it practical for use in real-world applications. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method on the widely-used HICO-DET datasets, where it outperforms existing state-of-the-art graph-based methods by a significant margin. Our results indicate that the TMHOI approach has the potential to significantly improve the accuracy and efficiency of HOI detection, and we anticipate that it will be of great interest to researchers and practitioners working on this challenging task.</p>

<p id="S1.p1.4" class="ltx_p">In recent years, the development of human-object interaction (HOI) detection has been a rapidly growing field in computer vision. The HOI detection technology is used to recognize the interactions between humans and objects in a given image, allowing for the more comprehensive understanding of human behavior and its relation to the surrounding environment. The development of HOI detection has been driven by advances in deep learning and neural networks, which have enabled more accurate and efficient analysis of visual data. The goal of HOI detection is to identify human-object interactions, which are depicted as the anticipated set <math id="S1.p1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\langle" display="inline"><semantics id="S1.p1.1.m1.1a"><mo stretchy="false" id="S1.p1.1.m1.1.1" xref="S1.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml">⟨</mo><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S1.p1.1.m1.1b"><ci id="S1.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S1.p1.1.m1.1.1">⟨</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S1.p1.1.m1.1c">\langle</annotation></semantics></math><span id="S1.p1.2.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">person, verb, object<math id="S1.p1.2.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\rangle" display="inline"><semantics id="S1.p1.2.1.m1.1a"><mo stretchy="false" id="S1.p1.2.1.m1.1.1" xref="S1.p1.2.1.m1.1.1.cmml">⟩</mo><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S1.p1.2.1.m1.1b"><ci id="S1.p1.2.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S1.p1.2.1.m1.1.1">⟩</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S1.p1.2.1.m1.1c">\rangle</annotation></semantics></math></span> triplet, for instance, <math id="S1.p1.3.m2.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\langle" display="inline"><semantics id="S1.p1.3.m2.1a"><mo stretchy="false" id="S1.p1.3.m2.1.1" xref="S1.p1.3.m2.1.1.cmml">⟨</mo><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S1.p1.3.m2.1b"><ci id="S1.p1.3.m2.1.1.cmml" xref="S1.p1.3.m2.1.1">⟨</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S1.p1.3.m2.1c">\langle</annotation></semantics></math><span id="S1.p1.4.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">person, read, book<math id="S1.p1.4.2.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\rangle" display="inline"><semantics id="S1.p1.4.2.m1.1a"><mo stretchy="false" id="S1.p1.4.2.m1.1.1" xref="S1.p1.4.2.m1.1.1.cmml">⟩</mo><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S1.p1.4.2.m1.1b"><ci id="S1.p1.4.2.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S1.p1.4.2.m1.1.1">⟩</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S1.p1.4.2.m1.1c">\rangle</annotation></semantics></math></span>. The detection of HOIs is commonly tackled as a multi-label classification task, whereby an image may entail multiple interactions taking place concurrently. For instance, a single image may exhibit a person engaging in both phone usage and coffee consumption simultaneously, thereby requiring the HOI detector to accurately identify and associate these interactions with the appropriate objects depicted in the image. Detecting the objects and humans present in an image is not the only aspect of the task; recognizing the particular interactions transpiring between them makes it a challenging and intricate undertaking.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">As it stands, multiple models and frameworks for human-object interaction (HOI) detection have been proposed. These methods can be broadly classified into one-stage and two-stage approaches. In the case of one-stage approaches<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>,<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite>,<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib41" title="" class="ltx_ref">41</a>]</cite>,<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>,<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>, the task is accomplished in a single step without the need for detecting the instance first. They can simultaneously detect all pairs of instances on an image and the interaction between these instance pairs. One-stage HOI methods are primarily of two types: interaction-point techniques <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>,<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">39</a>]</cite> and transformer-based methods<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite>,<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>. Interaction-point techniques leverage interaction points to illustrate the region of interaction between humans and objects. This approach efficiently explains the intimate association between people and objects. However, its effectiveness diminishes as the distance between them increases. As for the transformer-based method, it attracts enough attention since the DETR<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite> developed. The DETR introduced the structure resembling transformers into the computer vision algorithms. Transformer-based models have a more intricate architecture and utilize attention mechanisms to facilitate the learning of the head, although at a higher computational expense due to global feature processing. This methodology accommodates complex interactions and produces superior accuracy compared to interaction-point methods, albeit at a slower convergence rate.</p>

<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">As for the two-stage approaches<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite>,<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite>,<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>]</cite>,<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib40" title="" class="ltx_ref">40</a>]</cite>,<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>]</cite>, the detector is responsible for identifying all feasible instances present in the image. Subsequently, another network performs the HOI detection. The output of the object detector is a set of bounding boxes that localize the detected instances, along with corresponding scores that indicate the confidence score of the instance label. The object detector filters out the instances whose scores are below a certain threshold, retaining only the high-confidence instances. The detected instances from the first stage are used as input to a separate network that performs verb classification tasks. The HOI recognition network typically takes as input appearance features, the visual features of the detected instances, and contextual information such as the spatial layout between human and object pairs. In the previous two-stage approach<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>,<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>, they adopted the multi-stream method, adding a multi-label classifier after the object detector to make action prediction. While the subsequent paper<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>,<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>]</cite> proposes an alternative to the multi-label classifier, such as leveraging pose estimation techniques to incorporate pose information and fuse it with other features to forecast the action category. HOI detection methods often face issues with utilizing a CNN-based backbone feature, which neglects global features. Nonetheless, graph-based methodologies such as those proposed by Li <span id="S1.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al</span>. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>, Ulutan <span id="S1.p3.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al</span>. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite> and Zhang <span id="S1.p3.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al</span>. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>]</cite> overcome this limitation by capitalizing on appearance features and effectively utilizing spatial features.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">A significant proportion of HOI detection methodologies, whether one-stage or two-stage, depend exclusively on appearance features to predict human-object interactions. Nevertheless, such interactions are inherently intricate and markedly variable, making it difficult for HOI detectors to model them with only instance features of human and object entities. To address this challenge, researchers have developed graph-based techniques, which entail constructing a graph model that captures all human-object pair characteristics. By modeling the relationships between all human-object pairs in the image, the graph-based approach can capture spatial and semantic features between pairs of nodes, leading to more accurate HOI detection. In particular, the graph-based approach is useful for modeling complex interactions between multiple humans and objects, which can be difficult to capture with traditional two-stage methods that treat each human-object pair in isolation.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">The advanced graph-based HOI model adopted the appearance feature as the node representation and the spatial feature as the edge representation, then perform the link prediction, which is the verb prediction between the human and the object. Despite the promising performance, this approach only partially explores the semantic information between nodes. Specifically, some existing graph-based methods in HOI detection only leverage instance information and ignore other semantic features hidden in relations between nodes. However, there are certain patterns and tendencies in human-object interactions, such as the fact that people are more likely to read books rather than tables. The trap of implicit patterns would enable the provision of additional insights for graph embedding. But the previous graph-based methods did not encode this sentiment information into the node embedding.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">In light of the aforementioned limitations, this paper introduces a novel graph-based model for HOI detection named TMHOI: Translational Model for Human-Object Interaction Detection, as illustrated in <a href="#S1.F2" title="Figure 2 ‣ I Introduction ‣ TMHOI: Translational Model for Human-Object Interaction Detection" class="ltx_ref">Figure.2</a>. Our proposed approach employs the translational model to encode relation semantic features and then integrate them into the node embedding, thus strengthening the link between the appearance feature and the relation semantic feature. Furthermore, unlike previous graph-based methods that constructed node and edge embedding independently, our approach fortifies the connection between nodes and edges by incorporating relation features into node embedding. For instance, consider the example presented in <a href="#S0.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ TMHOI: Translational Model for Human-Object Interaction Detection" class="ltx_ref">Figure.1</a>. Previous graph-based techniques only relied on independent instance features to represent nodes. However, our proposed approach encodes relation features (i.e., the relationship between human-object pairs) into node representations. As a result, the node embedding is able to incorporate relation features and interact more effectively with edge embedding, which also aims to represent relation features.</p>

<p id="S2.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Human-Object Interaction Detection could be considered a downstream task of object detection. The advancement of HOI detection is intricately linked with the progress of object detection <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>. More recent methods have adopted deep learning architectures, and many HOI detection models now rely on neural network architectures. Existing work widely-used multi-steam framework proposed by Chao <span id="S2.SS1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al</span>. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>, consists of three streams: a human stream, an object stream, and an interaction stream. Several recent HOI detection algorithms have been proposed that incorporate various improvements.</p>

<div id="S2.SS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">HOI detection approaches can be broadly categorized into one-stage and two-stage methods based on their model architecture. Until the recent proposal of QPIC<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite>, two-stage methods have been the predominant approach in HOI detection, with human-pose approaches<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite>, graph-based approaches<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>, <a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>]</cite>, and other multi-stream approaches<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite> leveraging different frameworks and methods for predicting verbs in the head. In addition to the diverse head designs utilized in two-stage HOI detection, the effectiveness of the model is also influenced by the object detector employed. In contrast to two-stage HOI detection, where instances are first detected using an object detector, one-stage approaches directly generate predictions by leveraging the backbone of the object detector without performing explicit instance detection. The majority of one-stage HOI detection methods rely on transformer-based architectures, while others employ interaction point-based methods. One such approach, proposed by Liao <span id="S2.SS1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al</span>. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>, entails a pipeline that does not depend on object bounding box but instead directly detects interactions as key points. In recent years, transformer-based HOI detection has gained significant attention and demonstrated promising results, largely due to QPIC’s innovative use of transformer-based techniques in HOI detection. Subsequently, several works have followed in the footsteps of QPIC, such as <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>, <a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>]</cite>. However, it is not limited to one-stage approaches that have adopted transformer-based architectures, as demonstrated by the use of transformer-based techniques in the two-stage HOI detection method UPT<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>]</cite>. Despite the effectiveness of transformer-based methods in achieving good results in HOI detection, their application requires a substantial amount of computational resources, and the resulting predictions are often opaque, posing challenges to subsequent inference work. Furthermore, the relative homogeneity of HOI detection methods in the inference field exacerbates these challenges. Graph-based methods have been proposed as an alternative to address the aforementioned challenges faced by previous methods. Despite the fact that accuracy may be compromised to some extent, graph-based methods strike a good balance between computational efficiency and accuracy. Particularly, graph-based methods show great potential in reducing computation costs as they can effectively encode a graph representation with the aid of knowledge graph embedding models.</p>

The box appearance features serve as the initial values for the node features, which are subsequently updated through an iterative message-passing algorithm. In the following work, Wang <span id="S2.SS1.p3.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al</span>. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite> contended that the graph should account for the presence of heterogeneous nodes, human nodes, and object nodes. Gao <span id="S2.SS1.p3.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al</span>. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite> argue that employing homogeneous nodes within separate sub-graphs: human-centric and object-centric graphs, is beneficial because different nodes are responsible for passing and updating distinct information. Then VSGNet<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite> enhances the features by considering the spatial relationship between the interacting human-object pair and employs graph convolutions to exploit the inherent structural connections within the pair. A recent graph-based HOI detection model, named SCG <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>]</cite>, innovatively conditions the messages between pairs of nodes on their spatial relationships. To sum up, the graph model builds it up the CNN-based feature extraction, while CNNs are limited to extracting local features, Graph models can leverage spatial information and capture global dependencies, which is a valuable complement to CNN-based backbones.</p>

<div id="S2.SS2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Knowledge graph embedding (KGE) is a method that uses low-dimensional vectors to represent the entities and relations in a knowledge graph. This approach makes a good trade-off between model capacity and efficiency and can be applied to a range of downstream tasks, such as link prediction. By using KGE, it becomes possible to effectively capture the underlying structure of the knowledge graph and use it for various purposes. One of the earliest and most popular knowledge graph embedding methods is TransE<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>, which models each relation as a translation operation between the embedding of the head and tail entities. Since then, numerous other embedding methods have been proposed, such as TransH<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite>,
which introduce more complex transformations and modeling techniques to capture different relations of the knowledge graph structure. TransH considers the relation vector as a hyperplane and projects the entity vectors onto this hyperplane to compute the score. This approach enables TransH to model one-to-many and many-to-one relationships more effectively than TransE. We adopted TransH as the translational model for this study since it could handle one-to-many human-object interactions. This study is also the pioneer in using knowledge graph embedding (KGE) methods for HOI detection applications since no such methods have been previously employed in this domain.</p>

Building on this research, we also feed the node and edge embedding into an HOI graph prediction model. However, we use a novel semantic graph representation, and the HOI graph prediction model is capable of generating HOI predictions based on a novel representation. The graph model we employed was a bipartite graph proposed by Zhang <span id="S3.SS1.p1.16.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al</span>. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>]</cite>.</p>

The HICO-DET is a large-scale benchmark that contains 37,633 training and 9,546 test images, each annotated with a set of human-object interactions and the corresponding object bounding boxes. The interaction types are categorized into 600 classes, and the dataset contains a total of 80 object classes and 117 different action classes. The distribution of pairs across interaction classes is heavily imbalanced, with a long-tailed distribution. Specifically, there are 47 interaction categories that have only one training example.</p>

A predicted HOI instance is considered a true positive if the intersection over union (IoU) between the predicted human bounding box and the ground-truth human bounding box is greater than 0.5, and the IoU between the predicted object bounding box and the ground-truth object bounding box is also greater than 0.5. For every configuration, we provide the mean average precision (mAP) for three sets of HOI classes: the full set of 600 HOI classes (full), a set of 138 HOI classes with fewer than 10 training instances (rare), and a set of 462 HOI classes with 10 or more training instances (non-rare). The default setting for evaluating HOI (human-object interaction) detection involves testing on the entire set of images, including those that do not contain the object being targeted.</p>

As most outperforming approaches require significant computational resources and longer convergence times due to their reliance on transformer architecture in the prediction head, we limited our comparison to graph-based HOI detection methods. While these models deliver good performance, they come with substantial training costs. Graph-based approaches, however, offer a more efficient and computationally tractable alternative, leveraging their structure to achieve high levels of accuracy without the same resource demands.</p>

<p id="S4.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The present study examines the performance of the TMHOI algorithm in comparison to other graph-based approaches, both with and without the utilization of a fine-tuned detector. Our findings demonstrate that TMHOI outperforms other graph-based methods by achieving a mean average precision (mAP) of 0.92, without utilizing the fine-tuned detector. With the utilization of the fine-tuned detector, TMHOI exhibits superior performance, achieving a significant 1.32 mAP increase over the state-of-the-art method. Additionally, when compared to the interaction point approach, TMHOI outperforms with a margin of 3.48 mAP, further attesting to its effectiveness in this domain. These results emphasize the efficacy of the TMHOI algorithm and highlight its potential in HOI detection tasks.</p>

<p id="S4.SS2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">The performance of HOI approaches varies across different settings, revealing notable variations based on the use of a fine-tuned detector versus a detector without fine-tuning and the different feature utilization methods. This underscores the critical role of the object detector in two-stage HOI detections, as all works are built on the detections. In addition, the feature used for the HOI model is also vital, with more information utilized in the graph leading to better performance from the model. It is noted that the approach used in TMHOI, which utilized not only the appearance and spatial features but also the translation feature, resulted in a higher mAP score of 1.32 compared to SCG<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>]</cite> that only applied appearance and spatial features. Nonetheless, incorporating additional features into the model leads to an upsurge in computational expenses. To mitigate this issue, we propose the application of Knowledge Graph Embedding (KGE) for feature translation. Notably, this method incurs minimal costs while providing a highly advantageous feature. In contrast to DRG<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>, which leverages word embeddings of detected labels as a 300-dimensional semantic feature, TMHOI requires only a 50-dimensional semantic feature that is translated using Knowledge Graph Embedding (KGE). In conclusion, our proposed approach not only provides a novel feature but also achieves a higher mAP score in a simple and efficient manner(KGE).</p>

<p id="S4.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The importance of the embedding size cannot be overstated in knowledge graph embedding models. The size determines the number of dimensions in the continuous vector space utilized to represent entities and relations as low-dimensional embeddings. In the translational model, each relation is linked to a hyperplane in the embedding space, and entity embeddings are projected onto these hyperplanes to generate their representations. To ensure exceptional performance on downstream tasks like link prediction and entity classification, selecting the ideal embedding size is critical. If the embedding size is too small, the model’s expressiveness may be limited, and performance may suffer. Conversely, a too-large embedding size may result in overfitting and slower training. Therefore, it is imperative to conduct an ablation study to examine the impact of different embedding sizes on the model’s performance.</p>

As the size of the translation embedding increases, the proportion of the relation feature in the node embedding also increases, as the node embedding is a composite of the translation embedding and appearance feature of the node embedding. However, if the proportion of the relation feature becomes too large, it may adversely affect the final performance of the model. Thus, finding the appropriate balance between the appearance and relation features in the node embedding is a crucial task for graph-based models. In our experiments, an embedding size of <math id="S4.SS3.p3.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="k=50" display="inline"><semantics id="S4.SS3.p3.1.m1.1a"><mrow id="S4.SS3.p3.1.m1.1.1" xref="S4.SS3.p3.1.m1.1.1.cmml"><mi id="S4.SS3.p3.1.m1.1.1.2" xref="S4.SS3.p3.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml">k</mi><mo id="S4.SS3.p3.1.m1.1.1.1" xref="S4.SS3.p3.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml">=</mo><mn id="S4.SS3.p3.1.m1.1.1.3" xref="S4.SS3.p3.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml">50</mn></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S4.SS3.p3.1.m1.1b"><apply id="S4.SS3.p3.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS3.p3.1.m1.1.1"><eq id="S4.SS3.p3.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS3.p3.1.m1.1.1.1"></eq><ci id="S4.SS3.p3.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S4.SS3.p3.1.m1.1.1.2">𝑘</ci><cn type="integer" id="S4.SS3.p3.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S4.SS3.p3.1.m1.1.1.3">50</cn></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S4.SS3.p3.1.m1.1c">k=50</annotation></semantics></math> resulted in the best performance, suggesting that this particular size strikes a favorable balance between the appearance and relation features in the node embedding.</p>

<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">This paper presents a novel graph-based approach for human-object interaction detection, which employs a knowledge graph embedding model as the translational model to embed the relation feature and integrate it into the node embedding. By doing so, our approach enhances not only the node representation but also the consistency between the node embedding and edge embedding, leading to improved detection performance. This approach provides a new avenue for researchers to explore the use of knowledge graph embedding models in graph-based approaches for human-object interaction detection.</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Future work could explore improved methods for representing knowledge graph embeddings in graph-based approaches. Such methods have the potential to significantly reduce the computational requirements of graph models, making them more efficient and practical for real-world applications. One area in which this could be particularly useful is in transfer learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite>for human-object interaction detection. Many current datasets used for HOI detection are not representative of the complex interactions that occur in real-world settings. As such, it can be difficult to apply models trained on these datasets to real-world scenarios. To address this, we will explore more effective translational models for graph representation, with the aim of improving transfer learning for HOI detection. This research could ultimately lead to more practical and accurate HOI detection models that can be applied in a range of real-world contexts.</p>
