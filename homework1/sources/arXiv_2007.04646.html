<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">State-of-the-art single depth image-based 3D hand pose estimation methods are based on dense predictions, including voxel-to-voxel predictions, point-to-point regression, and pixel-wise estimations. Despite the good performance, those methods have a few issues in nature, such as the poor trade-off between accuracy and efficiency, and plain feature representation learning with local convolutions. In this paper, a novel pixel-wise prediction-based method is proposed to address the above issues. The key ideas are two-fold: a) explicitly modeling the dependencies among joints and the relations between the pixels and the joints for better local feature representation learning; b) unifying
the dense pixel-wise offset predictions and direct joint regression for end-to-end training. Specifically, we first propose a graph convolutional network (GCN) based joint graph reasoning module to model the complex dependencies among joints and augment the representation capability of each pixel. Then we densely estimate all pixels’ offsets to joints in both image plane and depth space and calculate the joints’ positions
by a weighted average over all pixels’ predictions, totally discarding the complex post-processing operations. The proposed model is implemented with an efficient 2D fully convolutional network (FCN) backbone and has only about 1.4M parameters. Extensive experiments on multiple 3D hand pose estimation benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed method
achieves new state-of-the-art accuracy while running very efficiently with around a speed of 110fps on a single NVIDIA 1080Ti GPU <span id="footnote1" class="ltx_note ltx_role_footnote"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">1</sup><span class="ltx_note_outer"><span class="ltx_note_content"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">1</sup><span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_note">1</span>This work was supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grants 61976095, in part by the Science and Technology Planning Project of Guangdong Province under Grant 2018B030323026.

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Vision-based 3D hand pose estimation aims to locate hand joints in 3D space from input hand images, which serves as one of the core techniques in contactless human computer interaction applications, such as virtual reality, augmented reality and robotic gripping <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>.
Recent years have witnessed significant advances <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>, <a href="#bib.bib48" title="" class="ltx_ref">48</a>, <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite> in this area with the availability of consumer depth cameras, such as Microsoft Kinect and Intel RealSense, and the success of deep learning technology in the computer vision community. However, accurate and real-time 3D hand pose estimation is still a challenging task due to the high articulation complexity of the hand, severe self-occlusion
between different fingers, poor quality of depth images, etc.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we focus on the problem of 3D hand pose estimation from a single depth image. At present, the state-of-the-art approaches to this task rely on deep learning technology, especially deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The main reasons are two-fold. On one hand,
public available large datasets <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib49" title="" class="ltx_ref">49</a>, <a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>, <a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">39</a>, <a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>]</cite> with fully labeled 3D hand poses provide a large number of training data for these data-hungry methods. On the other hand, CNNs with well-designed network structures provide very effective solutions to challenging visual learning tasks and have been demonstrated to outperform traditional
methods by a large margin in various computer vision tasks, including 3D hand pose estimation.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Best performing deep learning-based methods are detection-based, which formulate 3D hand pose parameters as volumetric heat-maps or extended 3D heat-maps together with offset vector fields and estimate them in a dense prediction manner with fully convolutional networks (FCNs) or PointNet <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>, <a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite>. Contrary to their
regression-based counterparts that directly map the depth images to 3D hand pose parameters and severely suffer from the problem of highly non-linear mapping, the detection-based methods can learn better feature representations by pose reparameterization and have proven to be more effective for both human pose estimation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>
and hand pose estimation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>, <a href="#bib.bib43" title="" class="ltx_ref">43</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">By analyzing previous detection-based methods, we find that they suffer from several drawbacks in nature, which can be improved to boost performance. First, they bear the problem of poor trade-off between accuracy and efficiency. For example, the V2V <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite> uses 3D CNNs to estimate volumetric heat-maps, which is very parameter-heavy and computationally inefficient. The pixel-wise and point-wise prediction-based methods <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib43" title="" class="ltx_ref">43</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite> take the advantages of 2D CNNs or PointNet to regress dense 3D estimations.
In spite of the higher efficiency, these methods achieve lower estimation precision empirically, and the complex post-processing operations still degrade the computational efficiency. Second, they consist of non-differentiable post-processing operations, such as taking maximum
and taking neighboring points, preventing fully end-to-end training and causing inevitable quantization errors. In addition, the models are trained with non-adaptive Gaussian heat-maps or joint-centered heat-maps, which may be suboptimal. Finally, the feature representation for each element (e.g., a voxel, a pixel or a point) is only learned by local convolutions ignoring the global context information. However, modeling the dependencies among joints and the relations between the elements and the joints helps to learn more abundant contextual information and better local feature representations.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">To cope with these problems, we propose a novel joint graph reasoning based pixel-to-offset prediction network (JGR-P2O) for 3D hand pose estimation, which aims at directly regressing joints’ positions from single depth images. Specifically, we decompose the 3D hand pose into joints’ 2D image plane coordinates and depth values, and estimate these parameters in an ensemble way, fully exploiting the 2.5D property of depth images. The proposed method consists of two key modules, i.e., GCN-based joint graph reasoning module and pixel-to-offset prediction module. The joint graph reasoning module aims at learning a better feature representation for each pixel, which is vital for dense prediction. First, the features of joints are generated by summarizing the global information encoded in local features. Second, the dependencies among joints are modeled by graph reasoning to obtain stronger feature representations
of joints. Finally, the evolved joints’ features are mapped back to local features accordingly enhancing the local feature representations. The pixel-to-offset prediction module densely estimates all the pixels’ offsets to joints in both image plane and depth space. And the joints’ positions in both image plane space and depth space are calculated by a weighted average over all the pixels’ predictions. In this way, we discard the complex post-processing operations used in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib43" title="" class="ltx_ref">43</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>, which improves not only the computational efficiency but also the estimation robustness.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">Note that our JGR-P2O can obtain joints’ positions directly from single depth images without extra post-processing operations. It generates intermediate dense offset vector fields, and can also be fully end-to-end trained under the direct supervision of joints’ positions, fully sharing
the merits of both detection-based and regression-based methods. It also explicitly models the dependencies among joints and the relations between the pixels and the joints to augment the local feature representations. The whole model is implemented with an efficient 2D FCN backbone and has only about 1.4M parameters. It generally outperforms the previous detection-based methods on effectiveness and efficiency simultaneously. Overall, the proposed method provides some effective solutions to
the problems encountered by previous detection-based methods.</p>

Finally, the evolved joints’ features are mapped back to local features
through a joint-to-pixel mapping mechanism, obtaining the pixel-wise
joint context representations which are combined with original local
features to enhance the local feature representations. The detailed

<p id="S3.SS3.p1.4" class="ltx_p">A depth image consists of pixels’ 2D image plane coordinates and depth
values (i.e., UVZ coordinates), which are the most direct information
for determining the positions of hand joints. In this paper, we also
decompose the 3D hand pose into joints’ 2D image plane coordinates
and depth values, and estimate these parameters in an ensemble way.
More concretely, a pixel’s UVZ coordinates and its offset vector to
a joint can determine the joint’s position in the UVZ coordinate system.
That is, instead of predicting the joint’s UVZ coordinates directly,
we can detour estimate the offset vector from the pixel to the joint
since the pixel’s UVZ coordinates can be obtained from the depth image
directly. To achieve robust estimation, we aggregate the predictions
of all the pixels to obtain the position of the joint.

The simplest baseline that combines the backbone network and a P2O module, denoted as P2O in Table <a href="#S3.T2" title="Table 2 ‣ 3.4 Training Strategy ‣ 3 The Proposed Method ‣ JGR-P2O: Joint Graph Reasoning based Pixel-to-Offset Prediction Network for 3D Hand Pose Estimation from a Single Depth Image" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>, estimates the joint’s positions with the average summation over all pixels’ predictions and obtains highest estimation error.

<div id="S5.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this work, we propose a new prediction network (JGR-P2O) for 3D
hand pose estimation from single depth images. Within JGR-P2O the
GCN-based joint graph reasoning module can help to learn better local
feature representation by explicitly modeling the dependencies among
joints and the relations between pixels and joints, and the pixel-to-offset
prediction module unifies the dense pixel-wise offset predictions
and direct joint regression for end-to-end training, fully exploiting
the 2.5D property of depth images. Extensive experiments demonstrate
the superiority of the JGR-P2O concerning for both accuracy and efficiency.</p>
