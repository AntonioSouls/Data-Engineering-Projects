<p id="id2.id1" class="ltx_p">Object 6D pose estimation is an important research topic in the field of computer vision due to its wide application requirements and the challenges brought by complexity and changes in the real-world. We think fully exploring the characteristics of spatial relationship between points will help to improve the pose estimation performance, especially in the scenes of background clutter and partial occlusion. But this information was usually ignored in previous work using RGB image or RGB-D data. In this paper, we propose a framework for 6D pose estimation from RGB-D data based on spatial structure characteristics of 3D keypoints. We adopt point-wise dense feature embedding to vote for 3D keypoints, which makes full use of the structure information of the rigid body. After the direction vectors pointing to the keypoints are predicted by CNN, we use RANSAC voting to calculate the coordinate of the 3D keypoints, then the pose transformation can be easily obtained by the least square method. In addition, a spatial dimension sampling strategy for points is employed, which makes the method achieve excellent performance on small training sets. The proposed method is verified on two benchmark datasets, LINEMOD and OCCLUSION LINEMOD. The experimental results show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches, achieves ADD(-S) accuracy of 98.7% on LINEMOD dataset and 52.6% on OCCLUSION LINEMOD dataset in real-time.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Object 6D pose estimation is a task to calculate the rotation and translation of an object relative to the world coordinate system, with six degrees of freedom. It is an important topic for many applications, such as augmented reality <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>, automatic driving <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite> and robot grasping <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>. The challenges of this task come from the complexity in the real-world, such as background clutter, partial occlusion and illumination change.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">With the rapid development of deep learning on image, a lot of methods for pose estimation using RGB image have been proposed <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>. Existing methods can be categorized as extended 2D object detection method <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>, predicting pose directly by CNN <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>, predicting 2D projection points <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite> and template matching <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>. But RGB image cannot provide rich feature information for industrial parts lacking texture information, and is vulnerable to illumination and other environmental changes. Some methods use only point cloud data to estimate object pose <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>, which is more robust to light changes and texture-less object, but a large number of feature calculation and matching processes make the prediction very slow. In addition, it is not enough to use only geometric information of point cloud, while color and texture information are also important for pose estimation.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Some recent methods employ RGB-D data and focus on how to integrate the two kinds of data better to improve the accuracy of pose estimation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>. For example, MCN <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite> considered the depth image as an additional channel of RGB image, then extracted the feature of this four-channel vector for pose prediction. PointFusion <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite> extracted the features of RGB image and point cloud respectively, and then directly concatenated them in the channel dimension. DenseFusion <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite> proposed a novel point-wise way to fuse the features of RGB image and point cloud, which can better represent the object structure. But they all regress object translation and rotation directly, ignoring the spatial relationship information between points. Besides, the discontinuity of rotation makes the network difficult to learn.</p>

<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">To overcome these problems, we consider how to make full use of the spatial relationship between points, which is crucial for representation of object space state and is easy for CNN to optimize. However, using the spatial relationship of all points will involve a lot of work, resulting in low efficiency of calculation. So 3D keypoints are selected in order to extract the spatial relationship information, as shown in Fig. <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ I INTRODUCTION ‣ 3D Point-to-Keypoint Voting Network for 6D Pose Estimation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>. This paper proposes a 6D pose estimation framework based on 3D keypoints, in which dense fusion feature is employed to vote for the keypoints. First, we extract features from RGB-D data individually and fuse them in the form of point-wise. Then the dense feature embedding is employed to predict direction vectors from sample points to 3D keypoints and the position of keypoints is inferred by RANSAC voting. Finally, pose can be calculated by the least square optimization algorithm. Our method can effectively learn the spatial structure information of the rigid body.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">During implementation, there is an important problem that it is time-consuming to label the groundtruth of pose in the practical application. So some datasets have very limited training data, such as LINEMOD dataset <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>, which may lead to overfitting problem. To avoid this problem, our network input is sampled in spatial dimension. During iterative training, partial point-wise embeddings are selected randomly to make the prediction instead of using all of them. In this way, the network input is different each time, which is equivalent to data augmentation, so our network can achieve good results even on small sample datasets.</p>

<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S2.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Template matching methods.</span> Given CAD model of an object, some traditional methods extract different kinds of feature to match scene data and CAD model, in order to find the correct transformation. PPF <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite> proposes orientation point pair feature which is efficient and robust, then extracts it from model point cloud and scene point cloud respectively to match. Hinterstoisser <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite> extracts contour gradient information and object surface normal vector from color image and depth image respectively as multimodal features for template matching. AAE <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite> collects RGB images of model from different perspectives and obtains many codebooks via autoencoder, then calculates the similarity with RGB images in the actual scene. Thanks to the CAD model of the object, these methods can easily acquire approximate results. But template matching always need to discretize the pose for comparing, which makes results inaccurate.</p>

<p id="S2.p2.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S2.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">2D-3D correspondence methods.</span> Inspired by object detection, some recent methods first find the 2D projection coordinates of keypoints on RGB image, and then employ 2D-3D correspondence to calculate pose by PnP <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>. BB8 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite> regards pose estimation as a 3D detection task and employs CNN to regress eight corners of 3D bounding box. YOLO-6D <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite> extends 2D detection framework YOLO to 3D and also adopts 3D bounding box corners as keypoints. However, these bounding box corners are far away from the object pixels in the image, resulting in larger localization errors. To overcome this problem, PVNet <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite> selects kepoints using the farthest point sampling (FPS) algorithm. Besides, instead of directly regressing the coordinate of the projection points, PVNet predicts the direction vector of each pixel pointing to the projection point, and then uses RANSAC based voting to get the position of the projection points. Pix2Pose <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite> predicts the 3D coordinates of every pixel in RGB image and regards the output 3D coordinates as color image, thus transforms this problem into image generation problem based on GAN training. DPOP <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite> applies two-channel UV texture map and employs sphere projection or cylinder projection to add texture to the model, then predicts the dense 2D-3D mapping between RGB image and 3D model. These methods only use RGB image, which is convenient to collect, but all of them make no use of the important spatial relationship between points.</p>

MCN <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite> further fuses the depth input as an additional channel of RGB image to a CNN architecture.

Then an average pooling layer is employed to generate a global feature vector, which is further concatenated to each
dense point-wise feature. In this way, the dense point-wise feature embedding we extracted contains both local and global information, which is more robust.</p>

So we randomly select three points with their vectors each time, and employ the least square method to find the closest point to the group of vectors as one of the inferred positions <math id="S3.SS3.p1.1.m1.2" class="ltx_Math" alttext="h_{k,i}" display="inline"><semantics id="S3.SS3.p1.1.m1.2a"><msub id="S3.SS3.p1.1.m1.2.3" xref="S3.SS3.p1.1.m1.2.3.cmml"><mi id="S3.SS3.p1.1.m1.2.3.2" xref="S3.SS3.p1.1.m1.2.3.2.cmml">h</mi><mrow id="S3.SS3.p1.1.m1.2.2.2.4" xref="S3.SS3.p1.1.m1.2.2.2.3.cmml"><mi id="S3.SS3.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1" xref="S3.SS3.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.cmml">k</mi><mo id="S3.SS3.p1.1.m1.2.2.2.4.1" xref="S3.SS3.p1.1.m1.2.2.2.3.cmml">,</mo><mi id="S3.SS3.p1.1.m1.2.2.2.2" xref="S3.SS3.p1.1.m1.2.2.2.2.cmml">i</mi></mrow></msub><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S3.SS3.p1.1.m1.2b"><apply id="S3.SS3.p1.1.m1.2.3.cmml" xref="S3.SS3.p1.1.m1.2.3"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S3.SS3.p1.1.m1.2.3.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS3.p1.1.m1.2.3">subscript</csymbol><ci id="S3.SS3.p1.1.m1.2.3.2.cmml" xref="S3.SS3.p1.1.m1.2.3.2">ℎ</ci><list id="S3.SS3.p1.1.m1.2.2.2.3.cmml" xref="S3.SS3.p1.1.m1.2.2.2.4"><ci id="S3.SS3.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS3.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1">𝑘</ci><ci id="S3.SS3.p1.1.m1.2.2.2.2.cmml" xref="S3.SS3.p1.1.m1.2.2.2.2">𝑖</ci></list></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S3.SS3.p1.1.m1.2c">h_{k,i}</annotation></semantics></math> of the keypoint <math id="S3.SS3.p1.2.m2.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="x_{k}" display="inline"><semantics id="S3.SS3.p1.2.m2.1a"><msub id="S3.SS3.p1.2.m2.1.1" xref="S3.SS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.cmml"><mi id="S3.SS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.2" xref="S3.SS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.2.cmml">x</mi><mi id="S3.SS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.3" xref="S3.SS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.3.cmml">k</mi></msub><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S3.SS3.p1.2.m2.1b"><apply id="S3.SS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS3.p1.2.m2.1.1"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S3.SS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS3.p1.2.m2.1.1">subscript</csymbol><ci id="S3.SS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S3.SS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.2">𝑥</ci><ci id="S3.SS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S3.SS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.3">𝑘</ci></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S3.SS3.p1.2.m2.1c">x_{k}</annotation></semantics></math>.

<p id="S4.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">During implementation, 8 keypoints and 1 center point are selected for network to predict following PVNet. And during both training and testing, 500 scene points are randomly sampled as input. In order to enhance the robustness of illumination, online data augmentation such as light condition change is applied. In order to make the network insensitive to the background, we synthesize another 10000 images which randomly sample background from SUN397 dataset <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite> using the “Cut and Paste” strategy. These tricks are aim to avoid overfitting.

Our ADD(-S) accuracy is 98.7%, which outperforms all other approaches. Ablation studies are also conducted to verify our performance without data augmentation and refine network (see Table <a href="#S4.T2" title="TABLE II ‣ IV EXPERIMENTS ‣ 3D Point-to-Keypoint Voting Network for 6D Pose Estimation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">II</span></a>). Our network can aquire accuracy of 94.8% without refine, while DenseFusion has only accuracy of 86.2%. It confirms that our basic architecture is better than the state-of-the-art methods. Besides, the accuracy of our model which only trains on a small number of real data is 96.6%, thus it can be seen that our spatial dimension sample strategy is helpful for avoiding overfitting. Some visualization results are shown in Fig. <a href="#S4.F3" title="Figure 3 ‣ IV EXPERIMENTS ‣ 3D Point-to-Keypoint Voting Network for 6D Pose Estimation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a>, in which object CAD model is rendered on RGB image using estimated pose and the contour is also drawn on image.</p>

<div id="S5.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">An object 6D pose estimation method by 3D point-to-keypoint voting is proposed in this paper. Dense point-wise feature is employed to predict direction vectors, and 3D keypoints coordination is acquired by RANSAC voting. The final pose transformation is obtained by optimizing the distance between the scene keypoints and the model keypoints. During iterative training, a spatial dimension sample strategy is employed to solve the overfitting problem under the small sample dataset. Experimental results show that our method can effectively utilize the spatial structure information of the rigid body, which is better than the state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and efficiency.</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In the future work, we plan to consider an one-stage method. We intend to predict confidence by CNN instead of RANSAC voting, and employ SVD to solve the least square method to make all processes derivable. Thus an end-to-end network can be designed which employs pose to supervise CNN learning to acquire more accurate results.</p>
