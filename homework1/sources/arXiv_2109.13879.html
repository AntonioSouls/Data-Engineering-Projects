<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">Estimating the 3D pose of a hand from a 2D image is a well-studied problem and a requirement for several real-life applications such as virtual reality, augmented reality, and hand gesture recognition. Currently, reasonable estimations can be computed from single RGB images, especially when a multi-task learning approach is used to force the system to consider the shape of the hand when its pose is determined. However, depending on the method used to represent the hand, the performance can drop considerably in real-life tasks, suggesting that stable descriptions are required to achieve satisfactory results. In this paper, we present a keypoint-based end-to-end framework for 3D hand and pose estimation and successfully apply it to the task of hand gesture recognition as a study case. Specifically, after a pre-processing step in which the images are normalized, the proposed pipeline uses a multi-task semantic feature extractor generating 2D heatmaps and hand silhouettes from RGB images, a viewpoint encoder to predict the hand and camera view parameters, a stable hand estimator to produce the 3D hand pose and shape, and a loss function to guide all of the components jointly during the learning phase. Tests were performed on a 3D pose and shape estimation benchmark dataset to assess the proposed framework, which obtained state-of-the-art performance. Our system was also evaluated on two hand-gesture recognition benchmark datasets and significantly outperformed other keypoint-based approaches, indicating that it is an effective solution that is able to generate stable 3D estimates for hand pose and shape.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">3D pose estimation is a fundamental technology that has become very important in recent years for computer vision-based tasks, primarily due to advances in several practical applications such as virtual reality (VR) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>, augmented reality (AR) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>, sign language recognition <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite> and, more generally, gesture recognition <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>. In these fields, much of the current effort is directed towards the pose estimation of hands since, due to the high number of joints, they are one of the most complex components of the human body <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>. To address this complexity, researchers generally follow either a model-driven or data-driven strategy. The former uses articulated hand models to describe bones, muscles, and tendons, for example, through kinematics constraints <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>, whereas the latter directly exploits depth, RGB-D, or RGB images <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite> to extract keypoints that represent a hand. Although both strategies have their merits, data-driven approaches have allowed various systems to achieve significant performance while remaining more straightforward to implement and are usually the preferred choice between the two strategies.
Although early data-driven works were based on machine learning or computer vision algorithms such as random forest <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite> and geodesic distance-based systems <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>, attention has recently shifted towards deep learning methods <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>. This is due to the high performance obtained in a heterogeneous range of fields such as emotion recognition <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>, medical image analysis <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>, and person re-identification <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>, as well as the availability of commodity hardware for capture systems <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite> that can provide different types of input (e.g., depth maps).</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">For the task of 3D hand pose estimation, methods based on deep learning architecture configurations such as multilayer perceptrons (MLPs), convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and autoencoders have been proposed. These methods usually analyze hand keypoints via 2D heatmaps, which represent hand skeletons and are extrapolated from depth <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>, RGB-D <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>, or RGB <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite> input images. While the first two of these input options provide useful information for estimating the 3D pose through the depth component, near state-of-the-art results have been obtained by exploiting single RGB images <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>.
The reasons for this are twofold. Firstly, even though commodity sensors are available, it is hard to acquire and correctly label a depth dataset due to the intrinsic complexity of the hand skeleton, which has resulted in a lack of such datasets. Secondly, RGB images can easily be exploited in conjunction with data augmentation strategies, thus allowing a network to be trained more easily <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>.
To further improve the estimation of 3D hand pose from 2D images, several recent works have exploited more complex architectures (e.g., residual network) and the multi-task learning paradigm by generating 3D hand shapes together with their estimated pose.
By leveraging these approaches together with hand models, such as the model with articulated and non-rigid deformations (MANO) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite> and graph CNNs <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite>, various systems have achieved state-of-the-art performance. In particular, they can produce correct hand shapes and obtain more accurate pose estimations from an analysis of 2D hand heatmaps and depth maps generated from a single RGB input image <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Inspired by the results reported in other works, we propose a keypoint-based end-to-end framework that can give state-of-the-art performance for both 3D hand pose and shape estimation; we also show that this system can be successfully applied to the task of hand gesture recognition and can outperform other keypoint-based works.
In more detail, our framework first applies a pre-processing phase to normalize RGB images containing hands.
A semantic feature extractor (SFE) with a multi-task stacked hourglass network is employed for the first time in the literature to simultaneously generate 2D heatmaps and hand silhouettes starting from an RGB image.
A novel viewpoint encoder (VE) is used to reduce the number of parameters required to encode the feature space representing the camera view during the computation of the viewpoint vector.
A stable hand pose/shape estimator (HE) based on a fine-tuned MANO layer is employed in conjunction with an improved version of a neural 3D mesh renderer <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite>. This is extended via a custom weak perspective projection through the 2D re-projection of the generated 3D joint positions and meshes. Finally, a multi-task loss function is used to train the various framework components to carry out the 3D hand pose and shape estimation.</p>

<div id="S2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Methods of 3D pose and shape estimation generally exploit depth, RGB-D, or RGB images. The last of these is usually the preferred solution due to the availability of datasets; however, approaches that leverage depth information have provided solutions and ideas that can also be applied to standalone RGB images.
For instance, the study in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite> introduces a hierarchical regression algorithm that starts with depth maps and describes hand keypoints based on their geometric properties and divides the hand into meaningful components such as the fingers and palm to obtain 3D poses.
In contrast, the study in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite> uses depth maps to build both 3D hand shapes and surfaces by defining 3D voxelized depth maps that can mitigate possible depth artifacts.
The representation of meaningful hand components and reductions in input noise are also relevant problems for RGB and RGB-D images.
For example, when considering RGB-D inputs for the task of 3D hand pose estimation, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite> and <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite> use the depth component to define hand characteristics through geometric primitives that are later matched with the RGB information to generate 3D poses, and hence to track the hands.
Specifically, spheres, cones, cylinders, and ellipsoids are used to describe the palm and fingers in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite>, while the approach in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite> employs only sphere primitives for faster computation.
Using a different technique, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite> focuses on handling input noise by using synthetic RGB-D images to train a CNN. In particular, the use of artificial RGB/depth image pairs is shown by the authors to alleviate the effects of missing or unlabeled depth datasets.</p>

<div id="S2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Approaches that exploit depth information are inherently more suitable for the 3D pose estimation task since they suffer less from image ambiguities compared to systems based exclusively on RGB images.
In view of this, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite> introduces a 2.5D representation by building a latent depth space via an autoencoder that retains depth information without directly using this type of data. The authors further refine this latent space through an element-wise multiplication with 2D heatmaps to increase the depth consistency and obtain realistic 3D hand poses.
Another work that focuses on depth retention without using the extra information at test time is presented in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite>. This scheme first employs a conditional variational autoencoder (VAE) to build the latent distribution of joints via the 2D heatmaps extracted from the input RGB image, and then exploits a weak-supervision approach through a depth regularizer that forces the autoencoder to consider automatically generated depth information in its latent space at training time.
A similar weak-supervision rationale is also applied in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite> where, in addition to depth information, the hand shape consistency is evaluated through a neural renderer.
More specifically, by exploiting the outputs of the MANO layer (i.e., the 3D hand pose and mesh), the authors project the 3D joint coordinates defining the hand pose into a 2D space to account for depth information, and implement a neural renderer to generate silhouettes from hand shapes to increase the consistency of the results. In the present work, we refine this procedure further via a weak re-projection that is applied to both 3D joint locations and mesh so that the proposed framework can also be applied to a different task.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Accounting for depth information without directly using such data enables higher performance when only RGB images are analyzed.
However, this image format introduces several challenges that must be addressed, such as different camera view parameters, background clutter, occlusions, and hand segmentation.
In general, to handle these problems, RGB-based methods define a pipeline that includes feature extraction from the input image (usually in the form of 2D heatmaps), a latent space representation of such features to allow for the extrapolation of meaningful view parameters, and the 3D hand pose estimation based on the computed view parameters.
For instance, the study in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite> implements a CNN called HandSegNet to identify hand silhouettes so that the input images can be cropped and resized around the hand. A second CNN (PoseNet) is then used to extract the features, i.e., 2D heatmaps, allowing the network to estimate the 3D pose via symmetric streams and to analyze the prior pose and the latent pose representation derived by the network.
The authors of <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>]</cite> instead devise a domain adaptation strategy in which a generative adversarial network (GAN), driven by the 2D heatmaps extracted from the input by a convolutional pose machine, automatically outputs hand-only images from hand-object images. The resulting hand-only images are then used to estimate the correct 3D pose, even in the case of occlusions (e.g., from the object being held). Object shapes are also exploited in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>]</cite> to handle occlusions that arise during the task of 3D hand pose estimation. The authors describe the use of two parallel encoders to obtain latent representations of both hand and object, which are in turn employed to define meaningful hand-object constellations via a custom contact loss, so that consistent 3D hand poses can be generated. In contrast, the authors of <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>]</cite> directly address the issues of background clutter and different camera view parameters by designing a disentangling VAE (dVAE) to decouple hand, background, and camera view, using a latent variable model, so that a MANO layer can receive the correct input to generate the 3D hand pose.
Furthermore, through the use of the dVAE, the authors are able to synthesize realistic hand images in a given 3D pose, which may also alleviate the issue of low numbers of available datasets.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p4.1" class="ltx_p">The use of the pipeline described above allows models to achieve state-of-the-art performance on the 3D hand pose estimation task. Nevertheless, depending on the 3D joint position generation procedure, a good latent space representation is necessary to ensure an effective system. For example, the scheme in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite> utilizes a stacked hourglass to retrieve 2D heatmaps from the input RGB image. A residual network is then implemented to generate a meaningful latent space, and a graph CNN is built to define both the 3D pose and the shape of the input hand. To further improve the results, the authors pre-train all networks on a synthetic dataset before fine-tuning them on the estimation task.
Unlike the model introduced in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite>, which is used as a starting point, the framework presented here extends the use of a stacked hourglass and residual network by defining a multi-task SFE and VE, respectively. Moreover, only the multi-task feature extractor is pre-trained on synthetic data so that the VE is able to obtain a hand abstraction that can be utilized in different tasks such as hand gesture recognition.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Finally, the latent space representation is also relevant when using other procedures for 3D pose estimation, such as the MANO layer, as discussed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>]</cite> and <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">38</a>]</cite>. In more detail, the former of these schemes extracts 2D heatmaps via a CNN, then employs an encoder to generate the MANO layer view parameters directly, while in the latter approach, a latent space is built by an evidence estimator module that leverages a convolutional pose machine, which generates the required parameters for the MANO layer. Both methods implement a re-projection procedure for the 3D joints, and this was further extended in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">38</a>]</cite> via iterative re-projection to improve the final 3D hand pose and hence the shape estimations. In the framework presented here, we exploit this interesting strategy in a different way from the two approaches described above by also applying the re-projection procedure to the mesh generated by the MANO layer so that the estimation can benefit from both outputs rather than only the 3D locations.</p>

<p id="S3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The proposed framework for 3D hand pose and shape estimation starts from a pre-processed hand image input, and first generates 2D heatmaps and hand silhouettes through the use of a multi-task SFE. Secondly, it estimates the camera, hand pose, and hand shape view parameters by exploiting the semantic features using a VE. Finally, it computes the hand 2D and 3D joints, mesh and silhouette by feeding the estimated view parameters to the HE, which consists of a MANO layer, weak perspective projection, and neural renderer components. We note that a single compound loss function is employed to drive the learning phase of the various modules jointly.

More specifically, to allow the proposed framework to focus on hands, each image is modified so that the hand is always centered and there is as little background as possible, while still retaining all of the 21 hand joints keypoints. The hand is centered by selecting the metacarpophalangeal joint (i.e., the base knuckle) of the middle finger as a center crop point <math id="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="p_{c}" display="inline"><semantics id="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.1a"><msub id="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1" xref="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml"><mi id="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.2" xref="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml">p</mi><mi id="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.3" xref="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml">c</mi></msub><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.1b"><apply id="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1">subscript</csymbol><ci id="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.2">𝑝</ci><ci id="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.3">𝑐</ci></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.1c">p_{c}</annotation></semantics></math>.

Finally, there is a natural variability among hand shapes in a human population, meaning that possible skeleton mismatches might be found in the MANO layer 3D joint output. To address this issue, we implemented a skeleton adaptation procedure following the solution presented in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>]</cite>. Skeleton adaptation is achieved via a linear layer initialized to the identity function, which maps the MANO joints to the final joint annotations.</p>

<p id="S3.SS5.p1.6" class="ltx_p">The final outputs of the proposed framework are the 3D joint positions and the hand mesh. However, in real-world datasets, the ground truths for 3D hand mesh, pose, shape, and view parameters, which are unknown in unconstrained situations, are hard to collect. Our framework therefore automatically generates intermediate representations (i.e., 2D heatmaps, hand silhouettes, and 2D re-projected joint positions and meshes), which are then exploited to train the whole system jointly using a single loss function.
The ground truths in this case are defined as follows:</p>

We then present a comprehensive performance evaluation. We report the results of ablation studies on each component of the framework to highlight the effectiveness of the proposed approach both quantitatively and qualitatively. We conduct a comparison with state-of-the-art alternatives for the 3D hand pose and shape estimation, and present the results obtained from a different task (i.e., hand-gesture recognition), so that the abstraction capabilities of our framework can be fully appreciated.</p>

<p id="S4.SS3.p2.1" class="ltx_p">To evaluate the proposed framework, we employ three metrics that are commonly used for 3D hand pose and shape estimation, and for hand gesture recognition. These are the 3D end-point-error (EPE) and area under the curve (AUC) for the former task, and accuracy for the latter.
The EPE used in the ablation studies is defined as the average Euclidean distance, measured in millimeters (mm), between predicted and ground truth keypoints. The AUC is computed based on the percentage of correct 3D keypoints (3D PCK) at different thresholds, for a range of 20-50 mm. Finally, for both metrics, the public implementation in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite> is employed for a fair comparison.</p>

This indicates that the 2D heatmaps allow the network to focus on the positions of the hand joints, whereas generating the heatmaps and silhouette simultaneously enables a comprehensive view of the hand that forces the joints to be placed in the right position when moving to a 3D plane. This behavior is further supported by the results of pre-training the SFE component on the ObMan dataset, where the occlusions force the network to create meaningful abstractions for both the 2D heatmaps and silhouette.</p>

Tests were performed on the number of parameters of the MANO layer, the proposed 2D re-projection, and the regularization loss. Increasing the number of hand articulations allowed us, as expected, to obtain more realistic hands and consequently more precise estimations when all 45 values were used. Applying the proposed 2D re-projection further reduced the EPE score by providing the MANO layer with direct feedback on its output. Employing the regularization loss resulted in a higher keypoint distance, with the difference derived from the hand shape collapsing onto itself as shown in the bottom row of Fig. <a href="#S4.F6" title="Figure 6 ‣ 4.3.1 Framework Quantitative and Qualitative Results ‣ 4.3 Performance Evaluation ‣ 4 Experimental Results ‣ 3D Hand Pose and Shape Estimation from RGB Images for Keypoint-Based Hand Gesture Recognition" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">6</span></a>.</p>

Stacked hourglass output concatenation improved the precision of the system by a further 0.31 mm, since it provided the VE with a finegrained input representation.

From the top row to the bottom, the outputs correspond to the proposed framework, the framework without 2D re-projection, the framework without the SFE module, and the full framework without the regularization loss. As can be seen, the most important component in terms of obtaining coherent hand shapes is the regularization loss, since otherwise the mesh collapses onto itself in order to satisfy the 3D joint locations during training time (bottom row in Fig. <a href="#S4.F6" title="Figure 6 ‣ 4.3.1 Framework Quantitative and Qualitative Results ‣ 4.3 Performance Evaluation ‣ 4 Experimental Results ‣ 3D Hand Pose and Shape Estimation from RGB Images for Keypoint-Based Hand Gesture Recognition" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">6</span></a>.c and Fig. <a href="#S4.F6" title="Figure 6 ‣ 4.3.1 Framework Quantitative and Qualitative Results ‣ 4.3 Performance Evaluation ‣ 4 Experimental Results ‣ 3D Hand Pose and Shape Estimation from RGB Images for Keypoint-Based Hand Gesture Recognition" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">6</span></a>.e).
When we employ the SFE module (first two rows in Fig. <a href="#S4.F6" title="Figure 6 ‣ 4.3.1 Framework Quantitative and Qualitative Results ‣ 4.3 Performance Evaluation ‣ 4 Experimental Results ‣ 3D Hand Pose and Shape Estimation from RGB Images for Keypoint-Based Hand Gesture Recognition" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">6</span></a>), more accurate 3D joints and shapes are generated since the SFE enforces both the correct localization of joints and the generation of a more realistic silhouette (Figs. <a href="#S4.F6" title="Figure 6 ‣ 4.3.1 Framework Quantitative and Qualitative Results ‣ 4.3 Performance Evaluation ‣ 4 Experimental Results ‣ 3D Hand Pose and Shape Estimation from RGB Images for Keypoint-Based Hand Gesture Recognition" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">6</span></a>.b, c, and d).
When we re-project the generated 3D-coordinates and mesh, the final 3D joint locations and hand shape (Figs. <a href="#S4.F6" title="Figure 6 ‣ 4.3.1 Framework Quantitative and Qualitative Results ‣ 4.3 Performance Evaluation ‣ 4 Experimental Results ‣ 3D Hand Pose and Shape Estimation from RGB Images for Keypoint-Based Hand Gesture Recognition" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">6</span></a>.d and e) are more consistent with both the estimated 2D locations and the input image (Figs. <a href="#S4.F6" title="Figure 6 ‣ 4.3.1 Framework Quantitative and Qualitative Results ‣ 4.3 Performance Evaluation ‣ 4 Experimental Results ‣ 3D Hand Pose and Shape Estimation from RGB Images for Keypoint-Based Hand Gesture Recognition" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">6</span></a>.b and a). To conclude this qualitative evaluation, some examples of failed 3D pose and shape estimations are shown in Fig. <a href="#S4.F7" title="Figure 7 ‣ 4.3.1 Framework Quantitative and Qualitative Results ‣ 4.3 Performance Evaluation ‣ 4 Experimental Results ‣ 3D Hand Pose and Shape Estimation from RGB Images for Keypoint-Based Hand Gesture Recognition" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">7</span></a>. It can be seen that although coherent hand poses and shapes are generated, the framework is unable to produce the correct output due to wrong estimations of both the 2D joints and the silhouette by the SFE. This preliminary error is then amplified by the subsequent framework modules, as can be seen from the discrepancy between the 2D and 3D joint locations shown in Figs. <a href="#S4.F7" title="Figure 7 ‣ 4.3.1 Framework Quantitative and Qualitative Results ‣ 4.3 Performance Evaluation ‣ 4 Experimental Results ‣ 3D Hand Pose and Shape Estimation from RGB Images for Keypoint-Based Hand Gesture Recognition" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">7</span></a>.b and d. Although the loss described in Section <a href="#S3.SS5" title="3.5 Multi-task Loss ‣ 3 Method ‣ 3D Hand Pose and Shape Estimation from RGB Images for Keypoint-Based Hand Gesture Recognition" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3.5</span></a> ultimately forces the MANO layer to produce consistent hands, as also discussed for the third experiment, it can also result in greater inaccuracy in the 3D joint position estimation to guarantee such a consistency. This outcome has two implications: firstly, it indicates that there is still room for improvement, particularly for the 2D joints and silhouette estimations that represent the first step in the proposed pipeline; and secondly, it highlights the effectiveness of the proposed framework, which can generate stable 3D representations from RGB images.</p>

<div id="S4.SS3.SSS2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS3.SSS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework, a state-of-the-art 3D PCK AUC comparison was carried out, as shown in Table <a href="#S4.T5" title="Table 5 ‣ 4.3.1 Framework Quantitative and Qualitative Results ‣ 4.3 Performance Evaluation ‣ 4 Experimental Results ‣ 3D Hand Pose and Shape Estimation from RGB Images for Keypoint-Based Hand Gesture Recognition" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5</span></a>. As can be seen, the presented system is competitive with other successful schemes while using only RGB images and outputting both 3D skeleton locations and mesh, indicating that all of our design choices allow the framework to generate good estimates using only RGB information. It is particularly interesting that the proposed method was able to easily outperform systems that exploited depth data, suggesting that the simultaneous use of the multi-task SFE, VE, and 2D re-projection can help to produce correct estimations by compensating for the missing depth information.
Specifically, the multi-task SFE enables the implementation of a customized VE that, unlike the scheme in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>]</cite>, does not require to be pre-trained on a synthetic dataset in order to perform well; there is also no need to normalize the latent feature space representation by using a VAE to disentangle different factors influencing the hand representation in order to obtain accurate 3D hand poses, as described in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>]</cite>.
Furthermore, thanks to the re-projection module, these results are obtained without applying an iterative regression module to the MANO layer, unlike in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite>, and <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>]</cite>, where progressive changes are carried out recurrently to refine the estimation parameters, thus simplifying the training procedure. In addition, the solutions implemented in the proposed framework allow us to avoid input assumptions and post-processing operations, unlike the majority of schemes in the literature where some parameter (e.g., global hand scale or root joint depth) is assumed to be known at test time, and secondly to achieve similar performance to the best model devised in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite>, even though the latter scheme employs a more powerful solution (i.e., a graph CNN instead of a fixed MANO layer) for the 3D hand pose and shape estimation.</p>

<div id="S4.SS3.SSS2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS3.SSS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">To conclude this comparison, the 3D PCK curve computed at different thresholds for several state-of-the-art works is shown in Fig. <a href="#S4.F8" title="Figure 8 ‣ 4.3.2 Comparison of 3D Hand Pose/Shape Estimation ‣ 4.3 Performance Evaluation ‣ 4 Experimental Results ‣ 3D Hand Pose and Shape Estimation from RGB Images for Keypoint-Based Hand Gesture Recognition" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">8</span></a>. It can be seen that performance on the 3D hand pose and shape estimation task is becoming saturated, and newer works can consistently achieve high performance with low error thresholds. In this context, the proposed method is on par with the top works in the literature, further supporting the view that all of our design choices allowed the framework to generate good 3D poses and shapes from monocular RGB images.</p>

<p id="S4.SS3.SSS3.p1.5" class="ltx_p">To assess the generalizability of the proposed framework, experiments were performed on the RWTH and Senz3D datasets. Since our architecture does not include a classification component, it was extended by attaching the same classifier described in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite> to handle the new task. This classifier takes as input the 3D joint coordinates generated by the MANO layer, and consists of three fully connected layers with a ReLU activation function.
Note that all of the weights (except those used for the classifier) are frozen when training the system on the hand gesture recognition task, so that it is possible to correctly evaluate the generalizability of the framework.
Moreover, although weights are frozen, the entire framework still needs to be executed. Hence, the majority of the training time is spent on the generation of the 3D joint coordinates, since this is where most of the computation is performed; as a result, each mini-batch is analyzed by the specified hardware configuration in <math id="S4.SS3.SSS3.p1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\sim" display="inline"><semantics id="S4.SS3.SSS3.p1.1.m1.1a"><mo id="S4.SS3.SSS3.p1.1.m1.1.1" xref="S4.SS3.SSS3.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml">∼</mo><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S4.SS3.SSS3.p1.1.m1.1b"><csymbol cd="latexml" id="S4.SS3.SSS3.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS3.SSS3.p1.1.m1.1.1">similar-to</csymbol></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S4.SS3.SSS3.p1.1.m1.1c">\sim</annotation></semantics></math>222 ms (i.e., <math id="S4.SS3.SSS3.p1.2.m2.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\sim" display="inline"><semantics id="S4.SS3.SSS3.p1.2.m2.1a"><mo id="S4.SS3.SSS3.p1.2.m2.1.1" xref="S4.SS3.SSS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.cmml">∼</mo><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S4.SS3.SSS3.p1.2.m2.1b"><csymbol cd="latexml" id="S4.SS3.SSS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS3.SSS3.p1.2.m2.1.1">similar-to</csymbol></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S4.SS3.SSS3.p1.2.m2.1c">\sim</annotation></semantics></math>37 ms per image), giving total times of <math id="S4.SS3.SSS3.p1.3.m3.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\sim" display="inline"><semantics id="S4.SS3.SSS3.p1.3.m3.1a"><mo id="S4.SS3.SSS3.p1.3.m3.1.1" xref="S4.SS3.SSS3.p1.3.m3.1.1.cmml">∼</mo><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S4.SS3.SSS3.p1.3.m3.1b"><csymbol cd="latexml" id="S4.SS3.SSS3.p1.3.m3.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS3.SSS3.p1.3.m3.1.1">similar-to</csymbol></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S4.SS3.SSS3.p1.3.m3.1c">\sim</annotation></semantics></math>206 s and <math id="S4.SS3.SSS3.p1.4.m4.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\sim" display="inline"><semantics id="S4.SS3.SSS3.p1.4.m4.1a"><mo id="S4.SS3.SSS3.p1.4.m4.1.1" xref="S4.SS3.SSS3.p1.4.m4.1.1.cmml">∼</mo><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S4.SS3.SSS3.p1.4.m4.1b"><csymbol cd="latexml" id="S4.SS3.SSS3.p1.4.m4.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS3.SSS3.p1.4.m4.1.1">similar-to</csymbol></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S4.SS3.SSS3.p1.4.m4.1c">\sim</annotation></semantics></math>235 s per epoch for the RWTH and Senz3D datasets, respectively.

The results are shown in Table <a href="#S4.T6" title="Table 6 ‣ 4.3.3 Comparison on Hand Gesture Recognition ‣ 4.3 Performance Evaluation ‣ 4 Experimental Results ‣ 3D Hand Pose and Shape Estimation from RGB Images for Keypoint-Based Hand Gesture Recognition" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">6</span></a>, and a comparison with other schemes in the literature is presented.
It can be seen that our framework consistently outperformed another work focusing on 3D pose and shape estimation (i.e., <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite>) on both datasets, meaning that it generates more accurate joint coordinates from the RGB image; the same result was also obtained for the estimation task, as shown in Table <a href="#S4.T5" title="Table 5 ‣ 4.3.1 Framework Quantitative and Qualitative Results ‣ 4.3 Performance Evaluation ‣ 4 Experimental Results ‣ 3D Hand Pose and Shape Estimation from RGB Images for Keypoint-Based Hand Gesture Recognition" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5</span></a>.
However, methods that exploit depth information (i.e., <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite> or concentrate on hand gesture classification (i.e., <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib47" title="" class="ltx_ref">47</a>]</cite>) can still achieve slightly higher performance. There are two reasons for this.
Firstly, by concentrating on the hand gesture classification task, lower performance is achieved on the estimation task, although similar information, such as the 3D joint locations, is used. As a matter of fact, even though they exploit depth information in their work, the authors of <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite> obtained an AUC score of 0.923, while the scheme in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite> and the proposed framework achieved AUC scores of 0.986 and 0.994 on the STB dataset for 3D hand pose estimation, respectively. Secondly, as discussed in Section <a href="#S4.SS3.SSS1" title="4.3.1 Framework Quantitative and Qualitative Results ‣ 4.3 Performance Evaluation ‣ 4 Experimental Results ‣ 3D Hand Pose and Shape Estimation from RGB Images for Keypoint-Based Hand Gesture Recognition" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4.3.1</span></a> and shown by the qualitative results in Fig. <a href="#S4.F7" title="Figure 7 ‣ 4.3.1 Framework Quantitative and Qualitative Results ‣ 4.3 Performance Evaluation ‣ 4 Experimental Results ‣ 3D Hand Pose and Shape Estimation from RGB Images for Keypoint-Based Hand Gesture Recognition" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">7</span></a>, the proposed architecture could be improved further by increasing the estimation accuracy of the 2D joints and silhouette, indicating that if a good hand abstraction is used to derive the 3D hand pose and shape, this can be effective for the hand gesture recognition task.</p>
</div>
<div id="S4.SS3.SSS3.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS3.SSS3.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In summary, the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the 3D hand pose and shape estimation task, can outperform other existing estimation approaches when applied to the hand gesture recognition task, and behaves in a comparable way to other specifically designed hand gesture recognition systems. This indicates that the proposed pipeline outputs stable hand pose estimations that can be effectively used to recognize hand-gestures.</p>

<div id="S5.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we have presented an end-to-end framework for the estimation of 3D hand pose and shape, and successfully applied it to the task of hand gesture recognition.
Our model comprises three modules, a multi-task SFE, a VE, and an HE with weak re-projection, each of which has certain strengths and weaknesses.
More specifically, the SFE, thanks to its pre-training providing multi-task context, enables our architecture to achieve similar performance to more powerful schemes in the literature that exploit graph representations, for instance. However, the 2D joints/silhouettes estimates could be improved through the use of more accurate algorithms for the generation of ground truths.
The VE did not require any form of pre-training, due to the fine-grained input from the SFE; this module was able to generate the parameters necessary to move from a 2D space to a 3D one, which is more easily applied in a diverse range of tasks and datasets.
It was important to experiment in order to find the right design for the VE, since this could have broken the entire system in scenarios of over- or underfitting where the produced viewpoint parameters do not allow for a correct estimation of the hand pose/shape.
Finally, unlike other existing works, the HE was able to output accurate estimations without requiring an iterative process, as its re-projection procedure allowed for closer correlation between the 3D and 2D hand representations during training. However, a regularization term was still required, as without this the meshes completely collapsed onto themselves when the system tried to generate near-perfect spatial 3D joint estimations.
We further improved our architecture through the use of advanced strategies such as skeleton adaptation and hourglass output concatenation, to obtain both more refined 3D joint locations and finer grained input representations.
Our experimental results demonstrate that the multi-task SFE, VE, HE with weak re-projection, and the use of advanced strategies, which were designed by exploiting and extending schemes in the literature, achieved state-of-the-art performance on the task of 3D hand pose and shape estimation.
Moreover, when applied to hand gesture recognition on both benchmark datasets, our framework outperformed other schemes that were devised for the estimation task and later employed to recognize hand gestures.</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In future work, to address the current weaknesses of our system, we plan to upgrade the SFE by first increasing the accuracy of its 2D heatmaps and silhouette estimation by generating the corresponding ground truths via deep learning-based segmentation algorithms. We will also design other meaningful features to extend the multi-task strategy.
In addition, we will explore solutions for the HE that are not based on the MANO layer but on other approaches such as graph representations of the hand, in order to increase the abstraction capabilities of the model. In view of this, additional experiments will be performed in which we will retain the 3D shape when moving to the hand gesture recognition task, with the aim of improving the final results.
Although the proposed model currently addresses the pose/shape estimation of single hands by design, it could be extended to simultaneously handle inputs containing both hands. Thus, another possible avenue for future work would involve the exploration of alternative architectural extensions or design modifications to handle input images containing two hands.
Moreover, since the proposed architecture can classify roughly 27 images per second, we will design an adaptation to try to achieve real-time gesture recognition from video sequences.</p>
