<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">Object detection in low-light scenarios has attracted much attention in the past few years. A mainstream and representative scheme introduces enhancers as the pre-processing for regular detectors. However, because of the disparity in task objectives between the enhancer and detector, this paradigm cannot shine at its best ability. In this work, we try to <span id="id1.id1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">arouse the potential of enhancer + detector</span>. Different from existing works, we extend the illumination-based enhancers (our newly designed or existing) as a scene decomposition module, whose removed illumination is exploited as the auxiliary in the detector for extracting detection-friendly features. A semantic aggregation module is further established for integrating multi-scale scene-related semantic information in the context space. Actually, our built scheme successfully transforms the “<span id="id1.id1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">trash</span>” (i.e., the ignored illumination in the detector) into the “<span id="id1.id1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">treasure</span>” for the detector. Plenty of experiments are conducted to reveal our superiority against other state-of-the-art methods. The code will be public if it is accepted.</p>

Different from the representative scheme (i.e., enhancer + detector) of low-light detection, we treat the illumination which is viewed as the trash as the treasure, to establish our decomposition-and-aggregation process. It needs to be emphasized that our defined scene decomposition can be instantiated as any illumination-based enhancers. The results in the top row of the right part are two methods based on the representative scheme (enhancer is defined as RUAS and SCI, and the detector is set as DSFD), and a recent method (HLA), respectively. The results in the bottom row are generated by our T2 with different settings of scene decomposition. We can observe that our T2 significantly upgrades the detection ability against the representative scheme. Additionally, our method brightens images (without any loss constraint for enhancement) to realize the enhancement exactly wanted for the detector. </figcaption>

<div id="Sx1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Object detection is a representative, familiar vision task both in industrial and academic communities. Along with the development of deep learning techniques, object detection in the regular environment has achieved prominent achievements. However, in specific settings, such as salient object detection <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Piao et al. <a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>, <a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>; Zhang et al. <a href="#bib.bib45" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite> and low-light object detection, there remains immense potential for research and optimization. Especially, images taken in low light conditions (e.g., nighttime) usually contain complex degradation to heavily limit the performance of regular detectors <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(He et al. <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">2016</a>; Jin et al. <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>; Tang et al. <a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>; Liu et al. <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021d</a>; Tang et al. <a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022</a>; Liu et al. <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021a</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite>. This degradation can be due to factors such as noise, low contrast, and insufficient illumination, which can reduce the visibility of objects and make them hard to detect. In the following, we will review existing works and introduce our contributions.</p>

<section id="Sx1.SSx1" class="ltx_subsection">
<h3 class="ltx_title ltx_title_subsection">Related Works</h3>

<div id="Sx1.SSx1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx1.SSx1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In the past few decades, various schemes have emerged for handling low-light object detection, which can be roughly divided into two categories. The mainstream one is to cascade enhancer and detector, the other is to specifically-design the low-light detector.</p>
</div>
<div id="Sx1.SSx1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx1.SSx1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">For the enhancer-introduced schemes, the well-known UG2+ Challenge competition<span id="footnote1" class="ltx_note ltx_role_footnote"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">1</sup><span class="ltx_note_outer"><span class="ltx_note_content"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">1</sup><span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_note">1</span><span class="ltx_ref ltx_nolink ltx_url ltx_ref_self">http://www.ug2challenge.org/</span></span></span></span> is a landmark event to drive research for low-light face detection. The cascade of enhancement and detection is the most common solution in the two consecutive championship schemes, e.g., the CAS-Newcastle team adopted this cascaded scheme <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Yuan et al. <a href="#bib.bib44" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>)</cite>, which illustrates the significance of researching the cascaded pattern. In addition, the latest enhancement schemes (e.g.,  <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Guo et al. <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>; Liu et al. <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022a</a>; Ma et al. <a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022a</a>; Xue et al. <a href="#bib.bib41" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022</a>; Ma et al. <a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">2023</a>)</cite>), and the work <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Lv, Li, and Lu <a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite> are no longer satisfied with the improvement of visual quality and try to apply the well-designed enhancer to the detection task to verify the effectiveness of the algorithm. For example, the improvement of detection performance on the Dark Face<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Yang et al. <a href="#bib.bib43" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020b</a>; Liu et al. <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021b</a>)</cite> dataset is a crucial experiment to demonstrate enhanced performance. However, these works often bring limited performance improvement, and it is even better to directly detect low light images. An intuitive explanation is that these enhancements are designed for human-friendly visual quality<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Lore, Akintayo, and Sarkar <a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">2017</a>; Wei et al. <a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">2018</a>; Chen et al. <a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">2018</a>; Li et al. <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">2018</a>)</cite>, and are difficult to apply to machine vision tasks focused on high-level semantic information, e.g., object detection. Certain methods produce black edges, retain dark noisy areas, or enhance contrast to improve the overall visual quality, but these enhancements can have a negative impact on the performance of object detection.</p>
</div>
<div id="Sx1.SSx1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx1.SSx1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">The other type of scheme makes an effort to start from the perspective of designing detectors in an end-to-end manner. Through a bidirectional low-level adaptation and multi-task high-level adaptation scheme, HLA <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Wang, Yang, and Liu <a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>; Wang et al. <a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022</a>)</cite> proposed a joint high-low adaptation framework. This method converted a face detector trained under normal light into a face detector under low light. While domain adaptation methods can mitigate the issue of having a limited number of labeled datasets, their performance improvements were often modest. The method proposed in REG <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Liang et al. <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite> is to seamlessly couple a cycle exposure generation module and a multiple exposure detection module, which improved the detection effects by effectively suppressing uneven illumination and noise problems. Moreover, the work <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Cui et al. <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite> did not apply the enhancement directly to the low-light image, but used the traditional camera signal processing method to transform the normal-light image into a low-light image, and utilized a predictive transform decoder to predict the parameters involved in the illumination transformation to complete the self-supervised training. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Liu et al. <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022b</a>)</cite> proposed a method called IA-YOLO that improves object detection performance in adverse weather conditions. Moreover, clustering helps in extracting better features <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Liu et al. <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">2012</a>; Wu, Lin, and Zha <a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>)</cite>. However, these specifically-designed methods lack the full exploration of scene information, resulting in limited performance improvement.</p>

<h3 class="ltx_title ltx_title_subsection">Two Key Challenges of Enhancer + Detector</h3>

<div id="Sx2.SSx1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx2.SSx1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Unlike regular object detection in normal-light environments, the main challenge for low-light object detection is that degraded observations with poor visibility heavily influence feature extraction, causing the accuracy to drop sharply. It is a direct and commonly-used manner to generate new visible data by improving visual quality. It is widely adopted in multiple champion solutions born in the UG2+ Challenge competition (landmark for low-light face detection). Among them, experimental explorations suggest that adopting a classical (e.g., MSRCR <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Jobson, Rahman, and Woodell <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">1997</a>)</cite>) one with poor visual quality is more effective than the latest advanced enhancer. Therefore, the preconceived conclusion “higher visual quality is more beneficial for detection” cannot be satisfied.</p>
</div>
<div id="Sx2.SSx1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx2.SSx1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Investigating its reason, on the one hand, these two tasks have different objectives, i.e., pixel-level visual-friendly to human eyes (enhancer) and semantic-level perception-friendly to machines (detector). In other words, the directly cascaded pattern aims at improving detection accuracy, and the enhancer is designed for catering to visual quality, rather than detection-desired high-quality data.
On the other hand, the enhancer indeed ameliorates visual quality but it inevitably destroys the inherent distribution that keeps the same situation as natural images, causing the enhanced data to keep a distinct information discrepancy with regularly captured data (maybe low-light, maybe normal-light), which heavily restricts the feature extraction. Combing the above analyses, we can conclude two key challenges for the paradigm of enhancer + detector, described as</p>

<p id="Sx2.SSx5.p2.2" class="ltx_p"><span id="Sx2.SSx5.p2.2.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">(1) The illumination is a treasure not trash for the detector</span>.
Our proposed algorithm is established based on the fact that “the illumination is a treasure not trash for the detector”. Here we verify this fact from an experimental perspective.
In Table <a href="#Sx2.T1" title="Table 1 ‣ Decomposing Scene for Detection ‣ Scene Decomposition Module ‣ Proposed Method ‣ Trash to Treasure: Low-Light Object Detection via Decomposition-and-Aggregation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>, we investigate different training patterns for enhancer + detector. Here, we consider two representative enhancers (RUAS and SCI) and the classical SSD detector with Feature Pyramid Networks.
The fine-tune detector and joint training methods cannot achieve good detection results.
Fortunately, after introducing the illumination for the detector (i.e., RUAS<sup id="Sx2.SSx5.p2.2.2" class="ltx_sup"><span id="Sx2.SSx5.p2.2.2.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">++</span></sup> and SCI<sup id="Sx2.SSx5.p2.2.3" class="ltx_sup"><span id="Sx2.SSx5.p2.2.3.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">++</span></sup>), the detection accuracy for these two enhancers all realize a significant boost (see the red-bold texts in the right bottom corner of the third and last rows in Table <a href="#Sx2.T1" title="Table 1 ‣ Decomposing Scene for Detection ‣ Scene Decomposition Module ‣ Proposed Method ‣ Trash to Treasure: Low-Light Object Detection via Decomposition-and-Aggregation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>). Deeply thinking, the performance improvement is benefited from the entire expression for scene information.
In a word, the experiments can fully verify the necessity of introducing illumination for the detector. Compared with existing manners, we can conclude that “illumination is a treasure not trash for the detector”.</p>

In our designed algorithm, the scene decomposition module is constructed based on physical knowledge (i.e., Retinex theory) for low-light image enhancement. Although we do not define the loss functions related to visual quality in the training phase, this module still implicitly possesses the tendentiousness for enhancing image quality. To verify it, we show the decomposed components among different methods (most methods come from Table <a href="#Sx2.T1" title="Table 1 ‣ Decomposing Scene for Detection ‣ Scene Decomposition Module ‣ Proposed Method ‣ Trash to Treasure: Low-Light Object Detection via Decomposition-and-Aggregation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>) on low-light scenarios, respectively.</p>

Notably, our fully designed T2 exhibits a certain image enhancement effect and is considered to possess friendly-detection features (as observed in the zoomed-in region). Moreover, RUAS<sup id="Sx2.SSx5.p4.4.1" class="ltx_sup"><span id="Sx2.SSx5.p4.4.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">++</span></sup> and SCI<sup id="Sx2.SSx5.p4.4.2" class="ltx_sup"><span id="Sx2.SSx5.p4.4.2.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">++</span></sup> perform better visual quality than RUAS<sup id="Sx2.SSx5.p4.4.3" class="ltx_sup">+</sup> and SCI<sup id="Sx2.SSx5.p4.4.4" class="ltx_sup">+</sup>, which also indicates that our T2 also realizes a mutual promotion for visual quality and detection accuracy (see Table <a href="#Sx2.T1" title="Table 1 ‣ Decomposing Scene for Detection ‣ Scene Decomposition Module ‣ Proposed Method ‣ Trash to Treasure: Low-Light Object Detection via Decomposition-and-Aggregation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>).</p>

<p id="Sx3.SSx1.SSSx3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In order to provide a comprehensive evaluation of our detection results, we employed both qualitative and quantitative analyses. Our detection framework is built upon two state-of-the-art face detectors, namely Pyramidbox <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Tang et al. <a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">2018</a>)</cite> and DSFD <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Li et al. <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>)</cite>. Pyramidbox is a context-assisted single shot face detector that has shown impressive performance in various face detection benchmarks. DSFD is a dual shot face detector that leverages a dual-stage strategy to improve the detection performance, especially for small and hard faces.
To enhance the quality of the input images, we utilized a variety of image enhancement methods including DeepUPE <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Wang et al. <a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>)</cite>, DRBN <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Yang et al. <a href="#bib.bib42" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020a</a>)</cite>, EnGAN <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Jiang et al. <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite>, FIDE <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Xu et al. <a href="#bib.bib40" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite>, KinD <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Zhang, Zhang, and Guo <a href="#bib.bib47" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>)</cite>, RUAS <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Liu et al. <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021c</a>)</cite>, ZeroDCE <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Guo et al. <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">2020</a>)</cite>, and SCI <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Ma et al. <a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">2022a</a>)</cite>.

<div id="Sx3.SSx2.SSSx1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx3.SSx2.SSSx1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Firstly, our proposed method exhibited significant advancements when compared to both the combination of advanced enhancer and detector, as well as mainstream low-light face detectors.

Concrete numerical results were reported in Table <a href="#Sx3.T3" title="Table 3 ‣ Evaluations on the ExDARK dataset ‣ Experimental Results ‣ Trash to Treasure: Low-Light Object Detection via Decomposition-and-Aggregation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a> (when both illumination and reflectance were used as input to the feature extractor, the FPN represented our semantic aggregation FPN). We can summarize three vital observations from this table. Firstly, the illumination layer also maintains enough information capacity, which almost obtains a comparable result compared with the version using low-light inputs <math id="Sx3.SSx4.SSSx1.p1.2.m2.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\mathbf{L}" display="inline"><semantics id="Sx3.SSx4.SSSx1.p1.2.m2.1a"><mi id="Sx3.SSx4.SSSx1.p1.2.m2.1.1" xref="Sx3.SSx4.SSSx1.p1.2.m2.1.1.cmml">𝐋</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="Sx3.SSx4.SSSx1.p1.2.m2.1b"><ci id="Sx3.SSx4.SSSx1.p1.2.m2.1.1.cmml" xref="Sx3.SSx4.SSSx1.p1.2.m2.1.1">𝐋</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="Sx3.SSx4.SSSx1.p1.2.m2.1c">\mathbf{L}</annotation></semantics></math>. Furthermore, reflection alone cannot obtain the best performance. Thus, it demonstrates the reasonability to extract the information from illumination. Secondly,
FPN network plays an important role to improve the performance, which can significantly improve 8.6% and 0.74 higher mAP when the
inputs are low-light images <math id="Sx3.SSx4.SSSx1.p1.3.m3.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\mathbf{L}" display="inline"><semantics id="Sx3.SSx4.SSSx1.p1.3.m3.1a"><mi id="Sx3.SSx4.SSSx1.p1.3.m3.1.1" xref="Sx3.SSx4.SSSx1.p1.3.m3.1.1.cmml">𝐋</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="Sx3.SSx4.SSSx1.p1.3.m3.1b"><ci id="Sx3.SSx4.SSSx1.p1.3.m3.1.1.cmml" xref="Sx3.SSx4.SSSx1.p1.3.m3.1.1">𝐋</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="Sx3.SSx4.SSSx1.p1.3.m3.1c">\mathbf{L}</annotation></semantics></math> and reflection <math id="Sx3.SSx4.SSSx1.p1.4.m4.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\mathbf{R}" display="inline"><semantics id="Sx3.SSx4.SSSx1.p1.4.m4.1a"><mi id="Sx3.SSx4.SSSx1.p1.4.m4.1.1" xref="Sx3.SSx4.SSSx1.p1.4.m4.1.1.cmml">𝐑</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="Sx3.SSx4.SSSx1.p1.4.m4.1b"><ci id="Sx3.SSx4.SSSx1.p1.4.m4.1.1.cmml" xref="Sx3.SSx4.SSSx1.p1.4.m4.1.1">𝐑</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="Sx3.SSx4.SSSx1.p1.4.m4.1c">\mathbf{R}</annotation></semantics></math> respectively. Therefore, we use the semantic aggregation FPN in T2.
For the performance of using scene information including illumination and reflectance, accuracy is significantly improved.</p>

<div id="Sx4.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this work, we proposed a new low-light object detector consisting of the scene decomposition and the semantic aggregation modules. We first analyzed the latent relationship between enhancer and detector to definitely point out the two key challenges. Then we constructed a scene decomposition module to present scene characteristics. A semantic aggregation composed of a weight-sharing feature extractor and multi-scale feature aggregator is proposed to integrate the scene information in the feature space. Finally, extensive experiments are performed to reveal our superiority.</p>

<div id="Sx4.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx4.p2.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="Sx4.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Broader Impacts</span>. How to effectively characterize scene information is an inherent appeal in designing our method. It is actually a general research focus for a variety of adverse conditions. Decomposing the scenes in the image space and aggregating the scenes in the feature space are crucial measures for our proposed T2. This way provides a new perspective to understand and handle the pattern of enhancer + detector, which will rekindle the enthusiasm to research the task of detection in adverse conditions.</p>
