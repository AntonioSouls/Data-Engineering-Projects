<p id="id9.id1" class="ltx_p">We propose a method for incorporating object interaction and human body dynamics into the task of 3D ego-pose estimation using a head-mounted camera.
We use a kinematics model of the human body to represent the entire range of human motion, and a dynamics model of the body to interact with objects inside a physics simulator.
By bringing together object modeling, kinematics modeling, and dynamics modeling in a reinforcement learning (RL) framework, we enable object-aware 3D ego-pose estimation.
We devise several representational innovations through the design of the state and action space to incorporate 3D scene context and improve pose estimation quality. We also construct a fine-tuning step to correct the drift and refine the estimated human-object interaction. This is the first work to estimate a physically valid 3D full body interaction sequence with objects (<em id="id9.id1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">e.g.</em>, chairs, boxes, obstacles) from egocentric videos. Experiments with both controlled and in-the-wild settings show that our method can successfully extract an object-conditioned 3D ego-pose sequence that is consistent with the laws of physics.</p>

<span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_section">1 </span>Introduction</h2>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">From a video captured by a single head-mounted wearable camera (<em id="S1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">e.g.</em>, smartglasses, action camera, body camera), we want to infer the wearer’s 3D pose and interaction with objects in the scene, as shown in Figure <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ Kinematics-Guided Reinforcement Learning for Object-Aware 3D Ego-Pose Estimation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>. This is crucial for applications such as virtual/augmented reality, sports analysis, medical monitoring, etc., where third-person views are often unavailable and high-quality estimates of complex and dynamic human motion are needed. However, this task is challenging since the wearer’s body is often unseen from a first-person view and the body motion needs to be inferred solely based on the visual context captured by the front-facing video. Furthermore, modeling physically realistic human-object interactions requires not only estimating the kinematic motion of the wearer, but also modelling the physical dynamics–the objects need to react to the forces applied by the human action in a physically realistic way. In this paper, we show that it is possible to infer accurate human motion and human-object interaction from a single, forward-facing wearable camera.</p>

</figure>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">First and foremost, we address the important issue of using either 1) kinematics or 2) dynamics-based human pose estimation approaches. 1) Kinematics-based approaches study motion without regard to the forces that cause it. These methods directly output the joint angles of the human model and ignore physics (<em id="S1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">e.g.,</em> how much force is needed at each joint to hold the pose). They can often achieve better pose estimates but produce results that may violate physical constraints (<em id="S1.p2.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">e.g.,</em> joints bending the wrong way). Moreover, a kinematics-based model can not faithfully emulate human-object interactions–no physically realistic grasping, pushing, stepping, etc. can be performed without simulating physics. 2) Dynamics-based approaches represent methods that study motions that result from forces. They use a physics simulator and output joint torques to control the humanoid inside the simulator. Thus, these approaches output physically realistic human poses and can lead to convincing human-object interaction (pushing an object will make it move accordingly). However, since no ground truth joint torques are available, dynamics-based approaches are hard to learn and generalize. In this work, we argue that a hybrid approach is needed and propose using the output of the kinematics model as an additional signal to aid the training process and improve the performance of the dynamics model. Instead of training a dynamics model to directly map from the visual context to target joint angles like in prior works <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>, <a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite>, we propose to train an additional kinematics pose estimator and employ a novel action representation where the RL policy network is tasked to compute the residual pose against the output from a trained kinematics model. Such a formulation makes use of the accurate pose estimation from a kinematics model while using a dynamics model to refine the estimated pose to obey the laws of physics.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">The second key missing piece is the scene context. Prior works <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>, <a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite> have long omitted the semantic scene context from the first-person view due to the complexity of modeling physically correct human-object interactions. However, the presence of objects in the first-person view can often provide a strong prior over the expected human behavior. For example, combining the presence of a chair and the motion of moving forward, turning around, and bending down, we can strongly infer the action of sitting down. Thus, it is imperative for learning models to draw upon this contextual information to make an educated guess about human motion and human-object interaction. To this end, we incorporate the 6-degree-of freedom (DoF) pose of the main object of interest into the state representation of our RL model to make our model aware of the objects’ states in the scene.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Another obstacle is the dynamics mismatch between the real world and simulation. As noted by prior work <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite>, global position and orientation drifts can often be observed over a long horizon of simulation. Such drift can lead to a catastrophic failure of human-object interaction: the humanoid can completely miss the box to push or the chair to sit on. To make sure the correct human-object interaction can be simulated, we propose a fine-tuning step against video evidence to correct the drift in the root trajectories. We use a monocular camera tracking technique, such as Visual Inertial Odometry (VIO) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>, <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>, to extract the camera motion and fine-tune our learned policy to match against it. The fine-tuning step alleviates the mismatch between the estimated and real-world global trajectories, leading to a successful human-object interaction.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">As there is no public available egocentric video dataset that contains the 3D full-body pose and the 3D object pose, we capture a large-scale motion capture (MoCap) dataset in which the person wears a head-mounted camera and interacts with various objects. We capture three types of interactions: 1)sitting on (and standing up from) a chair, 2)pushing a box, and 3)avoiding obstacles while walking. We also capture an in-the-wild dataset that contains the same set of interactions.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">In summary, we tackle the challenging task of extrapolating 3D human motion and human-object interaction from egocentric videos. Our contributions are as follows: (1) We are the first to propose a DeepRL based method for physically valid 3D pose and human-object interaction estimation from egocentric videos. (2) We propose to use a hybrid of kinematics and dynamics approaches and employ a novel action representation in which the dynamics-based model outputs the residual of the action against a learned kinematics-based model. (3) We propose a fine-tuning step to reduce the drift and refine our estimation based on captured video evidence. (4) We experiment with a self-made large-scale MoCap dataset &amp; an in-the-wild dataset, and show that our model outperforms other state-of-the-art methods on several pose-based and physics-based metrics, while generalizing to the in-the-wild settings. Upon visual inspection, our framework can not only recover the 3D human motion from egocentric videos, but also simulate physically correct human-object interactions.</p>

Using the camera trajectory as an approximation to head motion, we can fine-tune the trained dynamics-based pose estimator to come up with physically valid pose estimates that conform to the extracted camera trajectory from the video. However, a naive fine-tuning step that only attempts to match humanoid motion with the tracked camera motion may lead to unnatural human poses since the policy may forget how to produce valid human poses. To overcome this issue, we introduce two types of regularization, 1) the fine-tuned pose estimate <math id="S3.SS3.p2.5.m5.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="{\bar{p}}_{t}" display="inline"><semantics id="S3.SS3.p2.5.m5.1a"><msub id="S3.SS3.p2.5.m5.1.1" xref="S3.SS3.p2.5.m5.1.1.cmml"><mover accent="true" id="S3.SS3.p2.5.m5.1.1.2" xref="S3.SS3.p2.5.m5.1.1.2.cmml"><mi id="S3.SS3.p2.5.m5.1.1.2.2" xref="S3.SS3.p2.5.m5.1.1.2.2.cmml">p</mi><mo id="S3.SS3.p2.5.m5.1.1.2.1" xref="S3.SS3.p2.5.m5.1.1.2.1.cmml">¯</mo></mover><mi id="S3.SS3.p2.5.m5.1.1.3" xref="S3.SS3.p2.5.m5.1.1.3.cmml">t</mi></msub><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S3.SS3.p2.5.m5.1b"><apply id="S3.SS3.p2.5.m5.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS3.p2.5.m5.1.1"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S3.SS3.p2.5.m5.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS3.p2.5.m5.1.1">subscript</csymbol><apply id="S3.SS3.p2.5.m5.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S3.SS3.p2.5.m5.1.1.2"><ci id="S3.SS3.p2.5.m5.1.1.2.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS3.p2.5.m5.1.1.2.1">¯</ci><ci id="S3.SS3.p2.5.m5.1.1.2.2.cmml" xref="S3.SS3.p2.5.m5.1.1.2.2">𝑝</ci></apply><ci id="S3.SS3.p2.5.m5.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S3.SS3.p2.5.m5.1.1.3">𝑡</ci></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S3.SS3.p2.5.m5.1c">{\bar{p}}_{t}</annotation></semantics></math> must not deviate from the input kinematics result too drastically. 2) we regularize the action space by penalizing the difference of the output <math id="S3.SS3.p2.6.m6.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\tilde{\mu}" display="inline"><semantics id="S3.SS3.p2.6.m6.1a"><mover accent="true" id="S3.SS3.p2.6.m6.1.1" xref="S3.SS3.p2.6.m6.1.1.cmml"><mi id="S3.SS3.p2.6.m6.1.1.2" xref="S3.SS3.p2.6.m6.1.1.2.cmml">μ</mi><mo id="S3.SS3.p2.6.m6.1.1.1" xref="S3.SS3.p2.6.m6.1.1.1.cmml">~</mo></mover><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S3.SS3.p2.6.m6.1b"><apply id="S3.SS3.p2.6.m6.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS3.p2.6.m6.1.1"><ci id="S3.SS3.p2.6.m6.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS3.p2.6.m6.1.1.1">~</ci><ci id="S3.SS3.p2.6.m6.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S3.SS3.p2.6.m6.1.1.2">𝜇</ci></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S3.SS3.p2.6.m6.1c">\tilde{\mu}</annotation></semantics></math> from the pretrained policy network <math id="S3.SS3.p2.7.m7.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\tilde{\pi}" display="inline"><semantics id="S3.SS3.p2.7.m7.1a"><mover accent="true" id="S3.SS3.p2.7.m7.1.1" xref="S3.SS3.p2.7.m7.1.1.cmml"><mi id="S3.SS3.p2.7.m7.1.1.2" xref="S3.SS3.p2.7.m7.1.1.2.cmml">π</mi><mo id="S3.SS3.p2.7.m7.1.1.1" xref="S3.SS3.p2.7.m7.1.1.1.cmml">~</mo></mover><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S3.SS3.p2.7.m7.1b"><apply id="S3.SS3.p2.7.m7.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS3.p2.7.m7.1.1"><ci id="S3.SS3.p2.7.m7.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS3.p2.7.m7.1.1.1">~</ci><ci id="S3.SS3.p2.7.m7.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S3.SS3.p2.7.m7.1.1.2">𝜋</ci></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S3.SS3.p2.7.m7.1c">\tilde{\pi}</annotation></semantics></math> and <math id="S3.SS3.p2.8.m8.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\mu" display="inline"><semantics id="S3.SS3.p2.8.m8.1a"><mi id="S3.SS3.p2.8.m8.1.1" xref="S3.SS3.p2.8.m8.1.1.cmml">μ</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S3.SS3.p2.8.m8.1b"><ci id="S3.SS3.p2.8.m8.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS3.p2.8.m8.1.1">𝜇</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S3.SS3.p2.8.m8.1c">\mu</annotation></semantics></math> from the fine-tuned policy <math id="S3.SS3.p2.9.m9.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\pi" display="inline"><semantics id="S3.SS3.p2.9.m9.1a"><mi id="S3.SS3.p2.9.m9.1.1" xref="S3.SS3.p2.9.m9.1.1.cmml">π</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S3.SS3.p2.9.m9.1b"><ci id="S3.SS3.p2.9.m9.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS3.p2.9.m9.1.1">𝜋</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S3.SS3.p2.9.m9.1c">\pi</annotation></semantics></math>.

<p id="S4.SS1.p1.5" class="ltx_p">As there is no public dataset available containing the ground-truth full-body human pose and object pose annotations where the person interacts with objects, we record a large-scale egocentric video dataset inside a Mocap studio. It includes three subjects and each subject is asked to wear a head-mounted camera and performs various complex human-object interactions for multiple takes. The actions consist of sitting on (standing up from) a chair, avoiding obstacles, and pushing a box. There are four categories of objects: chairs, tables, boxes, and obstacles. MoCap markers are attached to the camera wearer and the objects to get the 3D full-body human pose and <math id="S4.SS1.p1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="6" display="inline"><semantics id="S4.SS1.p1.1.m1.1a"><mn id="S4.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1" xref="S4.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml">6</mn><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S4.SS1.p1.1.m1.1b"><cn type="integer" id="S4.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1">6</cn></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S4.SS1.p1.1.m1.1c">6</annotation></semantics></math>DoF object pose.

To further showcase the generalization of our method, we also collect an in-the-wild dataset where an additional subject is tasked to perform similar tasks in an everyday setting wearing a head-mounted iPhone. Here, we use Apple’s ARKit to provide camera position &amp; orientation tracking as well as 6 DoF object pose estimation. The in-the-wild dataset has 15 takes in total, each lasting about 6 seconds. For in-the-wild, we use a third-person camera to capture a synchronized side-view of the person and use an off-the-shelf 3D human pose estimator <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite> to estimate 3D poses as pseudo-ground truth for evaluation.</p>

<p id="S5.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this evaluation, we train an individual model for each subject and evaluate on the test split of our MoCap dataset. From the quantitative results in Figure <a href="#S3.F3" title="Figure 3 ‣ 3.3 Fine-tuning of the policy network ‣ 3 Method ‣ Kinematics-Guided Reinforcement Learning for Object-Aware 3D Ego-Pose Estimation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a>, we can see that PoseReg can produce accurate pose estimation, but does not obey the laws of physics (such as sitting in mid-air, walking into the table). EgoPose, on the other hand, often fails to perform the action correctly (falls down or hits the obstacle). Overall, our method (second row) produces 3D human poses closer to the ground truth (top-row) than any other baselines, and successfully performs human-object interaction. <span id="S5.SS1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">To better visualize the quantitative results, please refer to our supplementary video. </span></p>

All results are average across all three subjects. For all actions, we observe that our method outperforms the two baselines across almost all actions and metrics, with occasional worse performance in joint angle estimation with the kinematics-based method (PoseReg). This is expected as PoseReg disregards physics and can estimate poses without constraints, while our method requires estimating a physically valid pose. We find that the humanoid controlled by EgoPose often falls down to the ground and collides with the object, resulting in high pose error. This is expected as EgoPose does not factor in object states into its pose estimation and suffers from error accumulation in global root positions. On the other hand, our object-aware state representation and our fine-tuning step ensure a correct human-object interaction, preventing falls and drifts. We can also observe the low velocity error and acceleration compared to the baseline method, which indicates that our residual action representation produces a more stable and smoother pose estimation.</p>

<div id="S5.SS6.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.SS6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Although our method can produce realistic human pose and human-object interaction estimation from egocentric videos, we are still at the early stage of this challenging task. Our method performs well in the MoCap studio setting and out-performs state-of-the-art methods in-the-wild, but can still fail to produce natural pose estimation for in-the-wild videos. Due to the severe domain shift, the result of the pose regressor is poor on in-the-wild data and can lead to unnatural motion such as severe foot sliding. As a result, our fine-tuning stage is forced to produce unnatural poses (e.g, long steps, awkward turns) to prevent falling. Furthermore, our method is still limited to a predefined set of interactions where we have data to learn from. To enable pose and human-object interaction estimation for arbitrary actions, much further investigation is needed.</p>

<div id="S6.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we tackle, for the first time, physically valid 3D pose estimation from an egocentric video while the person is interacting with objects. We collect a large-scale motion capture dataset to develop and evaluate our method, and extensive experiments have shown that our method outperforms all prior methods. Real-world experiments using an in-the-wild dataset further show that our method generalizes well to real-world use cases and can infer physically valid 3D human motion and human-object interaction from a front-facing camera feed.</p>
