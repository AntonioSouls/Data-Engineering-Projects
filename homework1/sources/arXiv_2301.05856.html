<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">Label assignment is a crucial process in object detection, which significantly influences the detection performance by determining positive or negative samples during training process. However, existing label assignment strategies barely consider the characteristics of targets in remote sensing images (RSIs) thoroughly, e.g., large variations in scales and aspect ratios, leading to insufficient and imbalanced sampling and introducing more low-quality samples, thereby limiting detection performance. To solve the above problems, an Elliptical Distribution aided Adaptive Rotation Label Assignment (EARL) is proposed to select high-quality positive samples adaptively in anchor-free detectors. Specifically, an adaptive scale sampling (ADS) strategy is presented to select samples adaptively among multi-level feature maps according to the scales of targets, which achieves sufficient sampling with more balanced scale-level sample distribution. In addition, a dynamic elliptical distribution aided sampling (DED) strategy is proposed to make the sample distribution more flexible to fit the shapes and orientations of targets, and filter out low-quality samples. Furthermore, a spatial distance weighting (SDW) module is introduced to integrate the adaptive distance weighting into loss function, which makes the detector more focused on the high-quality samples. Extensive experiments on several popular datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our proposed EARL, where without bells and whistles, it can be easily applied to different detectors and achieve state-of-the-art performance.

<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In the past few years, substantial methods<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite> have made significant progress for generic object detection that are designed for nature images, which have greatly promoted the development of object detection in RSIs<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite> and attract wide attention from researchers.
However, object detection in RSIs is still facing challenges from the characteristics of targets, such as arbitrary orientations and large variations in scales and aspect ratios.
To tackle these challenges, current detectors for RSIs <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>, <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>, <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite> often enhance orientation prediction by incorporating additional branches and alleviate scale variations by adopting multi-level feature maps<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>, <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>, <a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>, <a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite>.
However, it usually faces the crucial issue of selecting training (i.e., positive) samples at reasonable pixel-wise locations (i.e., spatial assignment) on appropriate levels of feature maps (i.e., scale assignment), namely label assignment <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite>.</p>

However, existing detectors for RSIs often adopt label assignment strategies migrated from generic detectors, such as maximum intersection over union (IoU) based strategies <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>, <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>, <a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite> and center-based strategies <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>, <a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite>, which are often unsuitable for object detection in RSIs due to the large variations in scales and aspect ratios of targets, resulting in insufficient and imbalanced sampling and introducing more low-quality samples (e.g., samples located on the background or near the boundaries), thereby limiting detection performance.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Concretely, existing methods (e.g., AOPG <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite> and GGHL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite>) often employ the fixed scale assignment strategy, which heuristically assigns samples on a specific level of feature maps to the target decided by the predefined fixed threshold. However, this heuristic approach often results in insufficient and imbalance sampling, especially in RSIs.
As illustrated in Fig. <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ I Introduction ‣ EARL: An Elliptical Distribution aided Adaptive Rotation Label Assignment for Oriented Object Detection in Remote Sensing Images" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>, few samples on the specific level of feature map are assigned to the targets with extreme scales and large aspect ratios (i.e., tiny car, elongated bus and large airplane), whereas for samples on other levels of feature maps, despite being located on the target itself, they are not assigned to the target (i.e., treated as negative samples), due to the fixed threshold. In addition, this approach often aggravates the scale-level sampling imbalance, when the target scales are unbalanced, especially in RSIs, where small targets are far more numerous than large targets. Consequently, the selected positive samples are often clustered in the low-level of feature maps, thus overwhelming the sufficient attention to the targets with other scales and introducing the scale-level bias.
In contrast, other methods (e.g., FSDet<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>) assign all samples across all levels of feature maps within the bounding box to the target, which often introduce large amounts of low-quality samples (e.g., background noise) and ambiguous samples (i.e., samples that are assigned to multiple targets simultaneously<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>), especially for targets with overlapping relationships, such as harbours and ships, that would disturb the training process. Therefore, a more flexible method is required for sample selection on multi-level feature maps.</p>

However, it still rarely takes into account the large variations in aspect ratios of targets in RSIs, which leads to many foreground samples being misclassified as negatives and results in insufficient sampling, as shown in Fig. <a href="#S1.F2" title="Figure 2 ‣ I Introduction ‣ EARL: An Elliptical Distribution aided Adaptive Rotation Label Assignment for Oriented Object Detection in Remote Sensing Images" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a> (b).

<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">To address the above problems, this work proposed an elliptical distribution aided adaptive rotation label assignment (EARL) strategy to select high-quality positive samples adaptively in orientation anchor-free detectors and yield better performance.
Specifically, an adaptive scale assignment (ADS) strategy is proposed to assign top-<math id="S1.p6.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="k" display="inline"><semantics id="S1.p6.1.m1.1a"><mi id="S1.p6.1.m1.1.1" xref="S1.p6.1.m1.1.1.cmml">k</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S1.p6.1.m1.1b"><ci id="S1.p6.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S1.p6.1.m1.1.1">𝑘</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S1.p6.1.m1.1c">k</annotation></semantics></math> samples from high to low level of feature maps adaptively according to the scales of targets, i.e., assigning more high-level samples and fewer low-level samples to the large targets, and conducting the opposite for the small targets. Therefore, it can achieve adaptive and sufficient sampling for extreme targets with more balanced scale-level sample distribution.
In addition, a dynamic elliptical distribution aided sampling (DED) strategy is presented to select samples following an elliptical distribution, which can adjust sampling range dynamically according to the aspect ratios of targets, i.e., the sampling range tends to be a contracted circular distribution when the shape of target is close to a square, and an inner tangent ellipse when the shape is elongated, which can achieve more flexible sample distribution to fit the shapes and orientations of targets and filter out low-quality samples.
Moreover, a spatial distance weighting (SDW) module is introduced to assign different weights to samples at different pixel-wise locations, e.g., assigning larger weights to the samples close to the center of target, and smaller weights to the samples near the boundaries, which allows the detector to focus on the high-quality samples, thereby further enhancing the detection performance.
Our proposed EARL can be easily deployed to different detectors to achieve better performance, where a simple anchor-free detector, R-FCOS <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>, and an advanced detector, RTMDet-R <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite>, with the minimal modification are employed to verify the effectiveness of our method. Extensive experiments on several popular RSIs datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our proposed EARL.</p>

<p id="S2.SS1.p1.2" class="ltx_p">Due to its wide range of application scenarios, oriented object detection in RSIs has developed rapidly. Similar to generic detectors, recent methods can be divided into two categories, i.e., anchor-based detectors and anchor-free detectors. To detect targets with arbitrary orientations, some anchor-based detectors<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>, <a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>, <a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>]</cite>, which are built on the two-stage framework, i.e., Faster R-CNN<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>, densely preset multiple anchors with different scales, aspect ratios and angles for better regression while introducing heavy anchor-related computations. After that, RoI-Transformer<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>]</cite> proposed an efficient region of interests (RoI) learner to transform horizontal proposals to rotated ones. Gliding Vertex<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>]</cite> described oriented targets by horizontal bounding boxes (HBB), which further avoided numerous anchors with multiple angles. Then, DODet<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">38</a>]</cite> was proposed to deal with the spatial misalignment between horizontal proposals and oriented targets, as well as the feature misalignment between classification and localization.
Whereas R<sup id="S2.SS1.p1.2.1" class="ltx_sup">3</sup>Det<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite> and S<sup id="S2.SS1.p1.2.2" class="ltx_sup">2</sup>A-Net<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite> followed the one-stage schema to balance accuracy and efficiency, and alleviated the feature misalignment issue. However, these methods still take a long time during training and inference<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">To maintain high efficiency, anchor-free detectors are designed to avoid the usage of anchors. For instance, TOSO<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite> directly regressed the surrounding HBB and transformation parameters to present rotated targets. IENet<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite> was built upon the classic one-stage anchor-free framework, i.e., FCOS, adding an additional branch with the interactive embranchment module to regress angles. Later, BBAVector<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">39</a>]</cite>, O<sup id="S2.SS1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_sup">2</sup>-DNet<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib40" title="" class="ltx_ref">40</a>]</cite> and ACE<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite> employed a simplified architecture and designed new oriented bounding box (OBB) representation methods.
However, these anchor-free detectors still not perform the state-of-the-art results compared with anchor-based detectors, and most of them are more likely to improve the architecture while not considering the training strategy, especially the label assignment strategy, which has been proven to be the essential difference between these two kinds of detectors<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite>.</p>

<div id="S2.SS2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Label assignment is a crucial component for convolutional neural network (CNN) based detectors to learn feature distribution of targets by determining positive or negative samples. Meanwhile, as the current detectors commonly adopt multi-scale feature maps to alleviate the scale variations, label assignment needs to simultaneously assign labels to samples at different spatial locations (spatial assignment) on different levels of feature maps (scale assignment)<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite>. Most anchor-based detectors<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite> assign the labels to anchors among multi-level feature maps by comparing the preset thresholds and IoU between anchors and ground truth bounding boxes. However, this strategy often involves many hyperparameters to adjust the scales and aspect ratios of anchors based on the datasets<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib41" title="" class="ltx_ref">41</a>]</cite>. Whereas anchor-free methods<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib42" title="" class="ltx_ref">42</a>, <a href="#bib.bib43" title="" class="ltx_ref">43</a>]</cite> often select samples inside the ground truth bounding box or the central area of targets for spatial assignment, and choose samples on a specific level of feature maps according to the predefined target size threshold for scale assignment. However, above strategies, which depend on the heuristic rules, may not be optimal enough.</p>

<div id="S2.SS2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Thus, recent works provide dynamic label assignment strategies, which allow models to learn to select samples by itself. For instance, FSAF<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite> dynamically assigned targets to the suitable feature levels based on computed loss. ATSS<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite> proposed an adaptive training sample selection method by adjusting the IoU threshold according to the statistics of targets, which also proposed the center sampling strategy to improve the quality of positive samples. Autoassign<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite> used two weighting modules to adjust the category-specific prior distribution according to the appearances of targets. As for oriented object detection, SASM<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib44" title="" class="ltx_ref">44</a>]</cite> was motivated by the idea of ATSS and designed a dynamic IoU threshold that incorporates shape information. RTMDet<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite> proposed a dynamic soft label assignment based on SimOTA<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib45" title="" class="ltx_ref">45</a>]</cite>. GGHL<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite> used a Gaussian heatmaps to define positive samples according to the shape and direction properties of targets. AOPG<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite> applied a region assignment scheme to select positive samples within the shrinked OBB area. Oriented RepPoints<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib46" title="" class="ltx_ref">46</a>]</cite> used an adaptive quality assessment and sample assignment scheme. FSDet<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite> assigned a soft weight to each sample among all levels of feature maps. However, the label assignments used by these methods are rarely consider the specific characteristics of targets in RSIs, i.e., large variations in scales and aspect ratios, resulting in insufficient and imbalanced sampling and often introducing large amounts of low-quality samples. Therefore, this study focuses on designing an adaptive label assignment strategy for orientation anchor-free detectors by taking into account the important characteristics in RSIs to address aforementioned problems.</p>

Whereas TKT strategy selects samples clustered at the bottom levels of feature maps, resulting in the imbalanced scale-level sample distribution. Therefore, above strategies will lead to the scale-level bias, especially when the target scale distribution is unbalanced, which is a common phenomenon in RSIs. In contrast, our proposed ADS can alleviate the problems mentioned above by sequentially sampling from high to low level of feature maps adaptively according to the scale variation of targets in RSIs.</p>

In addition, to stabilize the training process and yield better performance, we adopt a learning rate scheduler with the combination of warm-up training and multi-step learning rate. Here, a linear warm-up method is applied, where the warm-up factor is set as 0.001 with 1000 iterations at the beginning of training, and random flipping is employed for data augmentation. All the experiments were implemented on a computer with four NVIDIA A100 GPUs, while the inference speed is measured on a single GeForce RTX 3090 GPU with 24GB memory.</p>

<p id="S4.SS3.SSS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Taking PL and SV for instance, when using the baseline method, samples are restricted to be assigned on specific level of feature maps, as illustrated in Fig. <a href="#S4.F9" title="Figure 9 ‣ IV-C1 Effectiveness of ADS ‣ IV-C Ablation Study ‣ IV Experiments and Results ‣ EARL: An Elliptical Distribution aided Adaptive Rotation Label Assignment for Oriented Object Detection in Remote Sensing Images" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">9</span></a>, and yields feature insufficient for various scales of targets. By employing ADS strategy, samples are selected more balanced for both PL and SV on each feature map, hence features with more various scales can be learned. However, although ADS strategy is able to obtain a better scale-level distribution, it introduces background noise in higher-level feature maps for specific categories, e.g., BD and BC, and brings down the accuracy. In order to mitigate the noise, DED with SDW are applied and discussed in the following subsections.</p>

The reason is that low-quality samples are often involved in RBB, as illustrated in Fig. <a href="#S4.F12" title="Figure 12 ‣ IV-D1 Comparison with Existing Scale Assignments ‣ IV-D Comparison with Existing Label Assignment Strategies ‣ IV Experiments and Results ‣ EARL: An Elliptical Distribution aided Adaptive Rotation Label Assignment for Oriented Object Detection in Remote Sensing Images" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">12</span></a> (a), and using CA often directly discards foreground samples at both ends of bounding box, resulting in insufficient sampling, as shown in Fig. <a href="#S4.F12" title="Figure 12 ‣ IV-D1 Comparison with Existing Scale Assignments ‣ IV-D Comparison with Existing Label Assignment Strategies ‣ IV Experiments and Results ‣ EARL: An Elliptical Distribution aided Adaptive Rotation Label Assignment for Oriented Object Detection in Remote Sensing Images" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">12</span></a> (b).
When employing the proposed DED method, the sample distribution is more flexible to fit the shapes and orientations of targets, hence is more suitable for oriented object detection in RSIs, and achieves the mAP of 71.61% and 61.46% on DOTA and DIOR-R datasets, respectively.</p>

<p id="S4.SS5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">To evaluate the performance of the proposed EARL strategy, we conducted experiments compared with the state-of-the-art methods on three public RSIs datasets, i.e., DOTA, DIOR-R and HRSC2016, and the results are listed in Tables <a href="#S4.T7" title="Table VII ‣ IV-D2 Comparison with Existing Spatial Assignments ‣ IV-D Comparison with Existing Label Assignment Strategies ‣ IV Experiments and Results ‣ EARL: An Elliptical Distribution aided Adaptive Rotation Label Assignment for Oriented Object Detection in Remote Sensing Images" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">VII</span></a>, <a href="#S4.T8" title="Table VIII ‣ IV-E1 Performance Evaluation on DOTA Dataset ‣ IV-E Comparison with State-of-the-Art ‣ IV Experiments and Results ‣ EARL: An Elliptical Distribution aided Adaptive Rotation Label Assignment for Oriented Object Detection in Remote Sensing Images" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">VIII</span></a> and <a href="#S4.T9" title="Table IX ‣ IV-E1 Performance Evaluation on DOTA Dataset ‣ IV-E Comparison with State-of-the-Art ‣ IV Experiments and Results ‣ EARL: An Elliptical Distribution aided Adaptive Rotation Label Assignment for Oriented Object Detection in Remote Sensing Images" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">IX</span></a>, respectively. Note that, for the purpose of fair comparison, these results are from the corresponding papers of the comparison methods and datasets, unless specified.
In addition, to fully validate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed EARL strategy, a simple detector, i.e., R-FCOS, and an advanced detector, i.e., RTMDet-R, are selected as the baseline methods, where our EARL is deployed with them, denoted as R-FCOS-EARL and RTMDet-R-EARL, respectively.</p>

<p id="S4.SS5.SSS1.p1.2" class="ltx_p">Table <a href="#S4.T7" title="Table VII ‣ IV-D2 Comparison with Existing Spatial Assignments ‣ IV-D Comparison with Existing Label Assignment Strategies ‣ IV Experiments and Results ‣ EARL: An Elliptical Distribution aided Adaptive Rotation Label Assignment for Oriented Object Detection in Remote Sensing Images" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">VII</span></a> gives the comparison of the proposed method with both anchor-based and anchor-free state-of-the-art detectors on DOTA dataset. It can be observed that anchor-based detectors can usually achieve higher performance, e.g., S<sup id="S4.SS5.SSS1.p1.2.1" class="ltx_sup">2</sup>A-Net achieves 79.42% mAP. However, they often have limitations in inference speed due to complex structures and IoU calculations, which results in lower fps, e.g., 17.6 fps by S<sup id="S4.SS5.SSS1.p1.2.2" class="ltx_sup">2</sup>A-Net. As a balance of trade-off of accuracy and efficiency, when using ResNet50 as the backbone network, R-FCOS-EARL achieves mAP of 72.87% and inference speed of 33.5 fps, even without any tricks.</p>
</div>
<div id="S4.SS5.SSS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS5.SSS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">When compared with anchor-free detectors, our R-FCOS-EARL method provides the promising performance of 72.87% mAP with ResNet50 and 72.89% mAP with ResNet101. Specifically, when applying multi-scale augmentation in experiments, our method achieves the mAP of 76.03% with ResNet50 and 75.94% with ResNet101 and obtains the best AP results for small targets, such as SV of 81.54%, which further demonstrates the superiority of our method for detecting targets with extreme scales.
The visualization of detection results with our method is displayed in Fig. <a href="#S4.F13" title="Figure 13 ‣ IV-D2 Comparison with Existing Spatial Assignments ‣ IV-D Comparison with Existing Label Assignment Strategies ‣ IV Experiments and Results ‣ EARL: An Elliptical Distribution aided Adaptive Rotation Label Assignment for Oriented Object Detection in Remote Sensing Images" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">13</span></a>. It can be observed that the detector with our EARL strategy can accurately detect densely arranged targets and extreme targets benefited from the sufficient and balanced sampling.
Furthermore, our EARL is simply a training strategy which can be easily deployed to other detectors, e.g., when deployed on RTMDet-R, it obtains the state-of-the-art performance, i.e., 80.35% mAP.</p>

<div id="S4.SS5.SSS1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS5.SSS1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">In addition, to further illustrate that our method can obtain a better scale-level distribution, as shown in Fig. <a href="#S4.F14" title="Figure 14 ‣ IV-D2 Comparison with Existing Spatial Assignments ‣ IV-D Comparison with Existing Label Assignment Strategies ‣ IV Experiments and Results ‣ EARL: An Elliptical Distribution aided Adaptive Rotation Label Assignment for Oriented Object Detection in Remote Sensing Images" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">14</span></a>, the proposed R-FCOS-EARL is compared with the most relevant label assignment strategy, ATSS, together with
the baseline method R-FCOS on DOTA dataset, by comparing the distribution of the positive samples among multi-level feature maps statistically. It can be seen that R-FCOS and ATSS achieve scale assignment according to the predefined scale constraints, which causes imbalanced sample distribution, and leads to the scale-level bias, especially for targets with extreme scales and aspect ratios, such as GTF and SV. Whereas our method with ADS strategy ensures that targets with different scales and shapes can assign training samples from all feature maps adaptively, which alleviates the imbalanced sampling thus improves detection performance. As a result, R-FCOS-EARL achieves the mAP of 72.87%, which significantly improves mAP by 1.80% and 2.26% over R-FCOS and ATSS, respectively, as shown in Table <a href="#S4.T7" title="Table VII ‣ IV-D2 Comparison with Existing Spatial Assignments ‣ IV-D Comparison with Existing Label Assignment Strategies ‣ IV Experiments and Results ‣ EARL: An Elliptical Distribution aided Adaptive Rotation Label Assignment for Oriented Object Detection in Remote Sensing Images" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">VII</span></a>. Furthermore, the AP performance in Table <a href="#S4.T7" title="Table VII ‣ IV-D2 Comparison with Existing Spatial Assignments ‣ IV-D Comparison with Existing Label Assignment Strategies ‣ IV Experiments and Results ‣ EARL: An Elliptical Distribution aided Adaptive Rotation Label Assignment for Oriented Object Detection in Remote Sensing Images" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">VII</span></a> also confirms the improvement of our method for both extremely large and small targets, such as GTF, SBF, SV and LV. The above analysis proves that our EARL strategy is advantageous for object detection in RSIs.</p>

<div id="S5.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we presented a novel and effective label assignment strategy, namely EARL, for object detection in RSIs. In which, the ADS strategy was proposed to solve the problem of insufficient and imbalanced sampling for targets with large variations in scales and aspect ratios, by selecting samples from suitable and continuous multi-level feature maps. Considering the large aspect ratios of targets, the DED strategy was designed to obtain a more accurate and reasonable sampling range while filtering out low-quality samples, which can dynamically adjust sampling range according to the aspect ratios of targets. To make the detector more focused on high-quality samples, the SDW module was developed. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our proposed EARL on three publicly available and challenging RSIs datasets, including DOTA, DIOR-R and HRSC2016. Our EARL is so simple that it has the potential to be easily combined with different orientation detectors to achieve better performance.</p>
