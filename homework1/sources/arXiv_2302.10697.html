<p id="id7.id1" class="ltx_p">Fully supervised salient object detection (SOD) methods have made considerable progress in performance, yet these models rely heavily on expensive pixel-wise labels. Recently, to achieve a trade-off between labeling burden and performance, scribble-based SOD methods have attracted increasing attention. Previous scribble-based models directly implement the SOD task only based on SOD training data with limited information, it is extremely difficult for them to understand the image and further achieve a superior SOD task. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective framework guided by general visual representations with rich contextual semantic knowledge for scribble-based SOD. These general visual representations are generated by self-supervised learning based on large-scale unlabeled datasets. Our framework consists of a task-related encoder, a general visual module, and an information integration module to efficiently combine the general visual representations with task-related features to perform the SOD task based on understanding the contextual connections of images. Meanwhile, we propose a novel global semantic affinity loss to guide the model to perceive the global structure of the salient objects. Experimental results on five public benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method, which only utilizes scribble annotations without introducing any extra label, outperforms the state-of-the-art weakly supervised SOD methods. Specifically, it outperforms the previous best scribble-based method on all datasets with an average gain of 5.5% for max f-measure, 5.8% for mean f-measure, 24% for MAE, and 3.1% for E-measure. Moreover, our method achieves comparable or even superior performance to the state-of-the-art fully supervised models.</p>

In recent years, fully supervised SOD methods <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite> have made considerable progress in performance <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>, but these models rely heavily on a large number of pixel-wise labels that are time-consuming and expensive to collect.

Our method lies at the bottom of the diagram and performs the best.

<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Sparse labeling methods (e.g., image level, point, and scribble) have been proposed to relieve label burden while maintaining model performance. Image-level supervised SOD methods extract the class activation map (CAM) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite> from the image classification network as saliency localization. Nevertheless, the CAM contains rich noise that is almost impossible to correct in iterative training. Moreover, directly treating the most highlighted area in CAM as the salient region generated by the human eyes is somewhat controversial.
Point supervised labels <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite> can provide local ground truth and are generated with lower labeling time cost. Although only a few points are annotated, these annotations are obtained based on the human vision system, which can correctly guide the model without introducing any noise. However, discerning the complete salient objects based on a few points, especially for the boundary of the salient objects, is difficult for the model. Therefore, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite> uses an extra edge detector trained on edge datasets to help the model perceive object boundaries and predict integral salient objects.
Moreover, scribble tags <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite> are a relatively cost-effective choice because they cover more regions of salient objects and background, and do not consume much time compared with point annotations.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Scribble annotations are located inside the salient objects and the background, so predicting the intact objects, especially the precise boundaries, remains a challenge.
<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite> proposes the first scribble-based SOD method that applies an auxiliary edge detection task to help the model locate the object edges. However, this work introduces an additional edge detector and does not fundamentally address the issue that the scribble tag itself lacks edge information.
Furthermore, SCWSSOD <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite> explores the intrinsic properties of images and presents a local saliency coherence (LSC) loss, which can extend the central scribble points to integral objects to some extent.
The core idea is that nearby pixels with similar color should exhibit similar saliency values.
Although considerable progress has been achieved on scribble-based SOD, there is still much room for improvement in the incomplete objects predicted by such sparse label-based models due to the lack of global contextual perception.
</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">However, humans given an image and the corresponding scribble tags can immediately and accurately distinguish which parts belong to the same object as the scribble label. The main difference between humans and the above models is general visual knowledge. Specifically, as shown in the Fig. <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ I Introduction ‣ A Visual Representation-guided Framework with Global Affinity for Weakly Supervised Salient Object Detection" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>, humans possess rich life experience of various scenes and objects, so they can form a knowledge system, and it will support humans to construct the contextual connections between various regions of any image easily.
But previous models directly implement the SOD task only based on specific SOD training data without the support of rich experience and knowledge like humans, so breaking through the bottleneck is difficult for them.
Therefore, we propose a simple yet effective framework guided by general visual representations that simulate the general visual knowledge of humans for scribble-based SOD.
These general visual representations are generated by the vision transformer (ViT) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite> trained on large-scale unlabeled datasets in a self-supervised manner <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>, so they contain an initial understanding of images and possess a wealth of contextual semantic information.
Introducing general visual representations with rich semantic information can alleviate the above issues and support the model to understand and build connections between each part in an image.
In addition, some unsupervised SOD works <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>, <a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite> have begun to explore these features and validate their potential in SOD, but they directly use these features to determine the salient object rather than combine them with the network and lay the groundwork for understanding images.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Moreover, the scribble label covers only part of the object area, so developing a suitable loss function is also crucial to guiding the model to perceive the structure of the object. The previous study <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite> on scribble-based SOD only utilizes local information to expand the initial scribble regions via LSC loss, which penalizes pixels with similar color in local regions. Thus, propagating salient regions to complete salient objects in discontinuous or complex regions is difficult. In addition, based on the LSC loss and scribble annotation, which lack boundary-related supervision of salient objects, the model easily sacrifices indistinguishable concave regions and protruding elements, such as animal limbs, to guarantee correctness in predicting the majority of easily distinguishable regions of the salient objects. To address these issues, a global semantic affinity (GSA) loss, which further considers the overall affinity constraint between salient objects or backgrounds from a global perspective, is proposed. The main idea is to achieve high semantic similarities within the salient objects and within backgrounds by semantic features. In this way, regions far from the scribble or indistinguishable concave regions and protruding elements are directly linked to other regions and constrained by scribbles and other easy-to-identify areas during training.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, a visual representation guided-framework with global affinity, a simple but effective method for scribble-based SOD, is proposed.
We employ ViT trained on large-scale unlabeled datasets by self-supervised learning to produce general visual representations.
These representations, which are like rich human experience, contain abundant contextual semantic information and an initial understanding of images.
When we incorporate these features into the model, that is, based on a general understanding of the image, the model can better accomplish the weakly SOD task.
Unlike fully supervised methods, weakly supervised methods require a proper loss function to lead the model closer to the task requirements.
Here, we design a GSA loss to guide the model to aware contextual affinities from a global perspective; thus, it can capture more precise structure of salient objects.
Instead of low-level color features, we employ general visual representations to establish connections between image regions.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p7" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p7.1" class="ltx_p">Despite its simplicity, our method substantially surpasses the said weakly supervised SOD methods.
Moreover, our approach that only utilizes scribble annotations without introducing any extra label is comparable or even superior to the state-of-the-art fully supervised method.

Moreover, our method can be easily extended to point-based SOD, and the results prove the robustness and effective of our method.</p>

<p id="S2.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">With the rapid development of weakly supervised techniques, weakly supervised SOD methods, for example, image level-based, point-based, scribble-based, and multi-source-based are also explored to reduce the burden of pixel-wise annotation while maintaining model performance. Among them, the most widely researched is image-level-based SOD <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>, <a href="#bib.bib55" title="" class="ltx_ref">55</a>, <a href="#bib.bib56" title="" class="ltx_ref">56</a>, <a href="#bib.bib57" title="" class="ltx_ref">57</a>, <a href="#bib.bib58" title="" class="ltx_ref">58</a>, <a href="#bib.bib59" title="" class="ltx_ref">59</a>]</cite>.

<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite> finds that using the classification network can extract foreground information related to salient objects, and then train the saliency detection network based on extracted pseudo labels.
Then, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib57" title="" class="ltx_ref">57</a>, <a href="#bib.bib56" title="" class="ltx_ref">56</a>]</cite> note that the initial pseudo saliency map obtained by the classification network inevitably contains noise. Thus, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib57" title="" class="ltx_ref">57</a>]</cite> filters out more precise maps from multiple noise pseudo labels based on multiple directive filters, and <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib56" title="" class="ltx_ref">56</a>]</cite> presents a noise-sensitive training strategy to balance the learning of object information and noise.
In addition, other methods <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib55" title="" class="ltx_ref">55</a>, <a href="#bib.bib58" title="" class="ltx_ref">58</a>, <a href="#bib.bib59" title="" class="ltx_ref">59</a>]</cite> explore multi-source weak labels that combine image-level labels with other weak annotations or pseudo tags generated by unsupervised manual methods to provide more comprehensive information to the model.
However, these pseudo labels still contain rich noise that is difficult to correct in iterative training.
Point-supervised labels <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite> can provide local ground truth and are generated with lower labeling time cost. Although only a few points are annotated, these annotations are obtained based on the human vision system, which can correctly guide the model without introducing any noise. But it is difficult for the model to discern the complete salient objects based a few points, especially for the boundary of the salient objects. Therefore, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite> uses an extra edge detector trained on edge datasets to help the model perceive the boundaries of the object and predict integral salient objects.</p>

Furthermore, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite> explores the intrinsic properties of images and presents an LSC loss to improve local details.

<p id="S2.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">With the emergence of self-supervised representation learning methods and the revelation of object characteristics, several unsupervised object detection methods based on self-supervised ViTs have been proposed.
Concretely, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib60" title="" class="ltx_ref">60</a>]</cite> proposes to select a seed patch from self-supervised representations likely to belong to a foreground object, and then expands more patches that have high similarity with the seed patch to discover the whole foreground object.
Then, TokenCut <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite> presents a graph-based approach based on self-supervised ViT for unsupervised object discovery and extends this idea to unsupervised SOD.
Different from TokenCut, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite> proposes a spectral clustering method based on various self-supervised models for unsupervised SOD.
Although the introduction of self-supervised representations into unsupervised SOD is promising and has made some progress, it is difficult for them to distinguish which objects are salient, especially in complex scenes, because they still depend on hand-crafted priors to determine salient objects.
Similar to image-level-based SOD, it is currently somewhat controversial to take the highlight area only based on self-supervised representations as the salient region generated by the human eyes.
Moreover, the gap between these unsupervised methods and fully supervised SOD methods remains significant.
Unlike the above methods that directly utilize self-supervised representations, this paper treats these features as general knowledge with rich object and scene information, and integrates them into the network to assist the model to perceive contextual affinities.

<p id="S3.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Our visual representation-guided framework contains a task-related encoder (TRE), a general visual module (GVM), and an information integration module (IIM), as shown in Fig. <a href="#S2.F3" title="Figure 3 ‣ II-C Object Segmentation Properties of Self-supervised Vision Transformer ‣ II Related Work ‣ A Visual Representation-guided Framework with Global Affinity for Weakly Supervised Salient Object Detection" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a>.
Specifically, TRE is the common encoder that aims to filter irrelevant information and extract essential features to enforce the SOD task.
GVM primarily employs the ViT <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite> trained by self-supervised learning on a large-scale unlabeled datasets to provide general visual representations, which are like a wide range of human experience, thus helping the model understand the whole image and contextual relevance.
IIM gradually integrates various layers of task-related features and combines them with general visual features in each layers to realize their complementary advantages fully.
During training, the parameters of ViT are fixed, and it mainly provides general visual features to relieve the difficulty that task-related features cannot catch the contextual affinity of the objects or background in scribble-based SOD task, that is, the scribble label covers only part of the object area, making perceiving the structure of the object difficult for the model.
Meanwhile, TRE is designed to meet the requirements of the SOD task. Task-related features with various resolutions can compensate for the low resolution of the general visual features and guide the model to produce refined segmenting results.
During training, our proposed GSA loss is applied with LSC loss, the saliency structure consistency (SSC) loss <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>, and the partial cross entropy loss as the dominant loss to guide the model.
Simultaneously, we implement an auxiliary loss, which consists of the GSA loss, the LSC loss, and the partial cross entropy loss on each substage of IIM to supervise the intermediate predictions.</p>

<p id="S3.SS1.SSS0.Px2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">To demonstrate that general visual representations possess rich contextual semantic information, we sample six challenging images and present their foreground scribble similarity maps and background scribble similarity maps, as shown in Fig. <a href="#S3.F4" title="Figure 4 ‣ General Visual Module ‣ III-A Framework ‣ III Methodology ‣ A Visual Representation-guided Framework with Global Affinity for Weakly Supervised Salient Object Detection" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a>. The process of generating these similarity maps is relatively simple. By calculating the cosine distance between two points in general visual representations, the similarity value between the two points can be obtained. Then, we can get foreground scribble similarity map by calculating the average similarity between each point and all foreground scribble points.
The highlighted regions in the foreground scribble similarity maps indicate a strong correlation with the foreground scribble.
The process of generating the background scribble similarity maps is similar.
These sampled images contain various challenging scenes, such as complex backgrounds, high foreground-background similarity, multiple objects, and multi-colored foreground.
However, we can observe that the objects in both the foreground and background scribble similarity maps can be completely and accurately presented.
This phenomenon indicates that, given an image and the corresponding scribble tags, it is feasible to accurately distinguish which parts of the image belong to the same object as the scribble labels by utilizing general visual representations. Thus, general visual representations with rich contextual semantic information can help the model capture more complete salient objects.</p>

This method builds the similarity between nodes over the low-level color space, which may be effective to deal with the simple images, but is difficult for the complex scene of low foreground/background contrast.

<p id="S3.SS2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Instead of color feature, we use general visual representation based on DINO, which exhibits a significant ability to establish correlations between objects even in complex cases, to construct semantic similarities between nodes.
In addition, unlike directly classifying the nodes in the graph by the minimum cut algorithm, we design the GSA loss based on the idea of Ncut to guide the model to focus on global contextual consistency.
Concretely, the idea of GSA is to max the similarity in the same set to achieve the goal of maintaining the high similarity of nodes in the same set, which is similar to that of Ncut.

The reason is that calculating inter-class similarity is required to divide all patches into two classes, whereas the patch predictions of our model can be any value between 0, 1.
Hence, we tackle this problem by calculating intra-class similarity.
We can treat these patches as saliency and background points.
For example, a patch with a predicted value of 0.3 can be considered as a point of the salient object with a weight of 0.3 and a background point with a weight of 0.7.
Finally, we set a global energy to maintain the high similarity of patches in the same classification.

We use horizontal flips for data augmentation.
In the training phase, we employ the stochastic gradient descent (SGD) optimizer with a triangular warm-up and decay strategy with the maximum learning rate of 5e-3 and the minimum learning of 1e-5, a momentum of 0.9, and a weight decay of 5e-4. The total epoch is 40 and the batch size is set to 16.
These hyperparameters are same as SCWSSOD.
We employ the ViT-S/8 model <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite> trained with DINO to extract general visual features of patches.</p>

<p id="S4.SS1.SSS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The general visual features of each image are repeatedly utilized during training, so we firstly generate and save these features before training and then directly employ them to speed up the training. These features can be directly used for GSA loss.
No post-processing is used.
Our model contains around 69M trainable parameters and runs around 21 FPS for inference on an NVIDIA GeForce GTX 3090.
It requires a memory footprint of around 16 GB, and the training process takes about 11 hours.</p>

For fair comparisons, the saliency maps of these 17 methods are directly provided by the author or their released codes and we assess them with the same evaluation code.
The best results are marked in bold.
Compared with weakly supervised or unsupervised methods, our methods achieve a new state-of-the-state performance under all the metrics.
Concretely, our method outperforms previous best scribble-based method (SCWSSOD) on all datasets by a large margin with an average gain of 5.5% for <math id="S4.SS2.SSS1.p1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math"

The great improvement of our method is that it can construct global contextual affinities to identify the structure of salient objects better.
However, on simple datasets, such as ECSSD and HKU-IS, our method does not have an absolute advantage.
The reason is that, for these simple images where salient objects can be easily localized, and fully supervised approaches with pixel-wise information can handle the details better.</p>

<p id="S4.SS2.SSS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">To further evaluate the advantages of our proposed method, we sample eight images from DUTS-TE <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite> and DUT-OMRON <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite> and shows the saliency maps predicted by seven weakly supervised or unsupervised methods and six state-of-the-art fully supervised method in Fig. <a href="#S4.F6" title="Figure 6 ‣ IV-A2 Implementation Details ‣ IV-A Datasets and Implementation Details ‣ IV Experiments ‣ A Visual Representation-guided Framework with Global Affinity for Weakly Supervised Salient Object Detection" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">6</span></a>.
It can be seen that our weakly supervised method can handle various challenging scenarios, including foreground disturbance, cluttered background, similar fore-background, and
multi-object interference.
Compared with previous weakly supervised methods or unsupervised methods, our predicted saliency maps are more accurate and complete.
Compared with fully supervised methods, although our method performs slightly worse in boundary details, our method can capture correct salient objects and predict more complete structure.
These results illustrate the immense potential of building SOD models based on general visual features and the robustness of the GSA loss, which can effectively help and guide the model to capture the global contextual affinities to recognize the complete salient object.
Additionally, we can see that image-level SOD methods (i.e., NSAL and MFNet) and the unsupervised method TokenCut based on hand-crafted priors have difficulty capturing real salient objects without any human annotation on image 5, 6, and 7.</p>

<p id="S4.SS3.SSS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">To evaluate the effectiveness of introducing general visual features, we conduct a series of comparisons with and without GVM on DUTS-TE and PASCAL-S datasets, as shown in Table <a href="#S4.T2" title="TABLE II ‣ IV-B2 Qualitative Comparison ‣ IV-B Comparison with the State-of-the-arts ‣ IV Experiments ‣ A Visual Representation-guided Framework with Global Affinity for Weakly Supervised Salient Object Detection" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">II</span></a>.
We directly use SCWSSOD as the baseline model.
As we can see, whether or not the GSA loss is applied, when general visual features is introduced, the results on all metrics are substantially improved.
This phenomenon proves that the idea of implementing SOD supported by general visual features is reliable and effective for excellent performance.</p>

When general visual features are introduced, the model can not only predict more complete salient objects, but also capture difficult-to-discern boundary parts, such as concave regions of the salient objects or protrude-out thin legs.
In addition, we can see that our method generates more refined results when these low resolution general visual features are utilized, which suggests that our framework can effectively combine TRE with rich details and general visual features with abundant semantic information to produce excellent results.</p>

<div id="S4.SS3.SSS2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS3.SSS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We evaluate the influence of our GSA Loss in Table <a href="#S4.T2" title="TABLE II ‣ IV-B2 Qualitative Comparison ‣ IV-B Comparison with the State-of-the-arts ‣ IV Experiments ‣ A Visual Representation-guided Framework with Global Affinity for Weakly Supervised Salient Object Detection" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">II</span></a>.
It can be seen that when based on baseline model, using GSA loss can yield stable gain on all metrics, which shows that our loss can bring robust benefit to SOD.
Based on our model with fusing general visual features, using GAS loss can further improve the performance. This phenomenon explains general visual features rich in contextual semantic information, while our loss can further guide the model to exploit this information to focus on global affinities.
Columns 4 and 5 of Fig. <a href="#S4.F8" title="Figure 8 ‣ IV-C2 Effectiveness of GSA Loss ‣ IV-C Ablation Study ‣ IV Experiments ‣ A Visual Representation-guided Framework with Global Affinity for Weakly Supervised Salient Object Detection" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">8</span></a> show the saliency maps of the baseline with and without GSA loss.
Apparently, the predicted salient objects are more complete under the supervision of GSA loss.
Furthermore, we can observe that our method that introduces general visual features and GSA loss can predict more precise salient objects, which
means that our method can effectively play the respective roles of general visual representations and GSA loss.</p>
</div>
<div id="S4.SS3.SSS2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS3.SSS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In addition, to show the advantages of the GAS loss based on general visual representations, we compare our method with those based on low-level RGB color features, as shown in Table. <a href="#S4.T3" title="TABLE III ‣ IV-C1 Effectiveness of General Visual Features ‣ IV-C Ablation Study ‣ IV Experiments ‣ A Visual Representation-guided Framework with Global Affinity for Weakly Supervised Salient Object Detection" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">III</span></a>. We can find that the performance of the model is only slightly improved when the RGB-based GSA loss is introduced. However, adding the GSA loss based on general visual features can substantially improve the performance of the model. This result illustrates the effectiveness and rationality of the GSA loss based on general visual representations, which can address the issue that low-level features may be inadequate for complex scenes with low foreground-background contrast.</p>

<p id="S4.SS3.SSS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Scribble and point labels are quite similar in that they are both manually sparsely labeled and located inside salient objects and backgrounds. Therefore, to verify the reliability of our method further, we extend our method to the point-based SOD. In Table <a href="#S4.T4" title="TABLE IV ‣ IV-C2 Effectiveness of GSA Loss ‣ IV-C Ablation Study ‣ IV Experiments ‣ A Visual Representation-guided Framework with Global Affinity for Weakly Supervised Salient Object Detection" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">IV</span></a>, we compare our method with the baseline based on point annotations. The results show that our method based on point labels remarkably surpasses the point-based baseline, which further proves that our method is effective and robust.
Additionally, scribble-based methods are substantially superior to the point methods. The main reason is that scribble tags cover a wider range of salient objects and backgrounds, and can provide richer information to the model compared with point tags. It suggests that scribble tags may be a relatively cost-effective choice.</p>

The smaller the patch size, the higher the resolution of the general visual features. We can see that using general visual features with patch size of 8 performs better.

<div id="S5.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Our proposed method mainly enhances the model’s ability to distinguish salient objects by combining general visual representations and introducing the GSA loss, rather than optimizing edge details.
Thus, compared with pixel-wise supervised methods, there is still room for improvement in our method’s ability to accurately capture object boundaries.
The first and second rows in Figure <a href="#S4.F9" title="Figure 9 ‣ IV-C5 Different Weights of GSA Loss ‣ IV-C Ablation Study ‣ IV Experiments ‣ A Visual Representation-guided Framework with Global Affinity for Weakly Supervised Salient Object Detection" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">9</span></a> demonstrate the limitation of our method.
Our model is constructed based on the weakly supervised method SCWSSOD, which uses fully supervised model GCPANet as the basic network structure. Therefore, we directly compare our method with GCPANet to demonstrate the limitation of our method.
It can be observed that compared with GCPANet trained on pixel-wise annotations, our method has difficulty in distinguishing precise object contours, such as the gaps between human legs and bird beaks.
Rows 3 and 4 provide an intuitive demonstration of both the strengths and limitations of our method. While our method excels in accurately detecting complete salient objects, it falls short in effectively capturing fine details at the edges. This is because although our method introduces general visual representations to help the model strengthen the connection between regions, the resolution of these features is relatively low. As a result, the model cannot significantly improve in boundary details.</p>

</h2>

<div id="S6.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">This work proposes a simple yet effective framework guided by general visual representations that simulate the general visual knowledge of humans for scribble-based SOD, which aims to address the difficulty that previous models cannot capture the accurate structure of salient objects only based on weak SOD training data without the support of general knowledge like humans.
Besides, a GSA loss is further proposed by maintaining the high semantic similarities within the salient objects and within the backgrounds, and effectively guides the model to perceive global consistency. Without introducing any additional label, our method has made great progress, substantially surpassing previous weakly supervised SOD models, and is comparable with the state-of-the-art fully supervised method.
For future work, we will design an iterative refining framework to improve our method on edge details. Additionally, we will develop a general representation model for medical images and integrate it with our method to tackle the challenges in medical image segmentation.</p>
