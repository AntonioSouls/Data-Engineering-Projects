<p id="id2.id1" class="ltx_p">Most existing animal pose and shape estimation approaches reconstruct animal meshes with a parametric SMAL model. This is because the low-dimensional pose and shape parameters of the SMAL model makes it easier for deep networks to learn the high-dimensional animal meshes.
However, the SMAL model is learned from scans of toy animals with limited pose and shape variations, and thus may not be able to represent highly varying real animals well. This may result in poor fittings of the estimated meshes to the 2D evidences, <span id="id2.id1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">e</span>.<span id="id2.id1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">g</span>. 2D keypoints or silhouettes. To mitigate this problem, we propose a coarse-to-fine approach to reconstruct 3D animal mesh from a single image. The coarse estimation stage first estimates the pose, shape and translation parameters of the SMAL model. The estimated meshes are
then used as a starting point by a graph convolutional network (GCN) to predict a per-vertex deformation in the refinement stage. This combination of SMAL-based and vertex-based representations benefits from both parametric and non-parametric representations. We design our mesh refinement GCN (MRGCN) as an encoder-decoder structure with hierarchical feature representations to overcome the limited receptive field of traditional GCNs.
Moreover, we observe that the global image feature used by existing animal mesh reconstruction works is unable to capture detailed shape information for mesh refinement. We thus introduce a local feature extractor to retrieve a vertex-level feature and use it together with the global feature as the input of the MRGCN. We test our approach on the StanfordExtra dataset and achieve state-of-the-art results. Furthermore, we test the generalization capacity of our approach on the Animal Pose and BADJA datasets.

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Animals play an important role in our everyday life and the study of animals has many potential applications in zoology, farming and ecology. Although great success has been achieved for modeling humans, progress for the animals counterpart is relatively slow mainly due to the lack of labeled data. It is almost impossible to collect large scale 3D pose data for animals, which prevents the direct application of many existing human pose estimation techniques to animals. Some works solve this problem by training their model with synthetic data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite>. However, generating realistic images is challenging, and more importantly, the limited pose and shape variations of synthetic data may result in performance drop when applied to real images.
Other works avoid the requirement of 3D ground truth by making use of 2D weak supervision. For example, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite> render the estimated mesh or project the 3D keypoints onto the 2D image space, and then compute the losses based on ground truth silhouettes or 2D keypoints. This setting is more pragmatic since 2D animal annotations are more accessible. In view of this, we focus on learning 3D animal pose and shape with only 2D weak supervision in this work.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Reconstruction of the 3D mesh from a single RGB image with only 2D supervision is challenging because of the articulated structure of animals. Most existing works <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite> rely on the parametric statistical body shape model SMAL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>]</cite> to reconstruct animal poses and shapes. Specifically, the low dimensional parameterization of the SMAL model makes it easier for deep learning to learn the high dimensional 3D mesh with 3,889 vertices for high-quality reconstruction.
However, the shape space of the SMAL model is learned from 41 scans of toy animals and thus lacks pose and shape variations. This limits the representation capacity of the model and results in poor fittings of the estimated shapes to the 2D observations when applied to in-the-wild animal images, as illustrated in Figure <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ Coarse-to-fine Animal Pose and Shape Estimation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>. Both 2D keypoints (the left front leg in the first example and right ear in the second example) and silhouettes rendered from the coarse estimations do not match well with the ground truth annotations (rendered and ground truth silhouettes are denoted with green and red regions, and the yellow region is the overlap between them). To mitigate this problem, we design a two-stage approach to conduct a coarse-to-fine reconstruction.
In the coarse estimation stage, we regress the shape and pose parameters of the SMAL model from an RGB image and recover a coarse mesh from these parameters. The coarse mesh is then used as a starting point by a MRGCN to predict a per-vertex deformation in the refinement stage.
This combination of SMAL-based and vertex-based representations enable our network to benefit from both parametric and non-parametric representations. Some refined examples are shown in Figure <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ Coarse-to-fine Animal Pose and Shape Estimation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>, where both keypoint locations and overall shapes are improved.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">To facilitate the non-parametric representation in the refinement stage, we consider a mesh as a graph structure and use a GCN <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite> to encode the mesh topology (i.e., the edge and face information). Existing animal mesh reconstruction estimation works <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite> rely on a global image feature to recover 3D meshes. However, we observe that the global feature fails to capture local geometry information that is critical to recover shape details. To solve this problem, we introduce a local feature extractor to retrieve a per-vertex feature and use it together with the global feature as the input of each node in the MRGCN. The combination of the vertex-level local feature and the image-level global feature helps to capture both overall structure and detailed shape information. Moreover, the representation power of traditional GCNs is limited by the small receptive field since each node is updated by aggregating features of neighboring nodes. To mitigate this, we design our MRGCN as an encoder-decode structure. Specifically, the downsampling and upsampling operations in the encoder-decoder structure enables a hierarchical representation of the mesh data, where features of different mesh resolutions can be exploited for mesh refinement.</p>

The shapes estimated by SMPLify are highly underconstrained although strong priors are added during the fitting process. To improve this, subsequent works incorporate more information during optimization, such as silhouettes <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite> or multi-view videos <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>. The drawback of the optimization-based approaches is that the iterative optimization process is quite slow and tends to fail when the 2D keypoints or silhouettes are noisy. On the other hand, regression-based approaches directly regress the body model parameters from an input image, which is more computationally efficient than optimization-based approaches.

<p id="S2.SS0.SSS0.Px2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Animal pose estimation is less explored compared to human pose estimation mainly because of the lack of large scale datasets. It is almost impossible to collect thousands of 3D scan of animals as has been done in SMPL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>. The first parametric animal model SMAL is recently proposed by Zuffi <span id="S2.SS0.SSS0.Px2.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al</span>.<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>]</cite>, which is learned from 41 scans of animal toys. The SMAL model is further improved in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>]</cite> by fitting the model to multiple images such that it can generalize to unseen animals. In the view of the lack of animal data, synthetic datasets are generated in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite> to train their networks. However, there is domain gap between the synthetic and real images in terms of appearance, pose and shape variations. Although the domain shift problem can be mitigated by using a depth map <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite> or silhouette<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite> as the input, these information are not always available in practice.

The authors observe that the SMAL model failed to capture the large shape variations of different dog breeds, and propose to incorporate an EM algorithm into training to update the shape priors. However, it is not guaranteed that the priors are valid shapes since they are computed from the network predictions. We also work on the dog category following <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite> in this work, and we overcome the limited representation capacity of the SMAL model by combining it with a vertex-based representation.</p>

We analyze that this may be due to the imbalance between foreground and background pixels in the training images. Note that we crop each image according to a bounding box during preprocessing. This causes the foreground object to occupy a larger area of an image and thus an imbalance of more foreground than background pixels.
The imbalance problem may cause the network to estimate a mesh with larger size or larger focal length such that there will be more foreground pixels in the rendered silhouette. To solve this problem, we adopt the Tversky loss <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite> from the semantic segmentation task:</p>

In the original GCN, features of each node are updated by averaging over features of neighboring nodes. This results in a small receptive field and limits the representation capacity. To mitigate this problem, we design our MRGCN as an encoder-decoder architecture to effectively exploit features of different mesh resolutions. Specifically, the graph encoder consists of consecutive graph convolutional layers and downsampling layers, and the decoder is a symmetry of the encoder architecture except that the downsampling layers are replaced with upsampling layers. Following <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>, the mesh downsampling is performed by using a transformation <math

The shape and pose prior in the first stage can not be used as we are directly regressing the vertex deformation. Without any constraint, the network is susceptible to large deformations in its predictions in order to align perfectly with the 2D evidences. This may result in unrealistic output meshes. In view of this problem, we add a Laplacian regularizer to prevent large deformations such that only fine-grained details are added upon the coarse estimation. Specifically, we encourage the Laplacian coordinates of the refined mesh to be the same as the coarse mesh by enforcing:</p>

PCK computes the percentage of joints that are within a normalized distance to the ground truth locations, and we use it to evaluate the quality of the estimated pose.
We normalize the joint distance based on the square root of 2D silhouette area and use a threshold of 0.15, which we denote as PCK@0.15. Following <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>, we also evaluate PCK@0.15 on different body parts, including legs, tail, ears and face. The IOU measures the overlap between the rendered silhouettes and the ground truth annotations, and we use it to evaluate the quality of the estimated 3D shapes.</p>

The optimization is run for each image, which means 2D keypoints and silhouettes are needed during test. We list the results of 3D-M when ground truth (GT) or predicted (Pred) keypoints and silhouette are used. CGAS <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite> first predicts 2D keypoints from silhouette with their proposed genetic algorithm, denoted as CGAS, and then run an optimization step to match the 2D evidences. Both WLDO <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite> and our approach are regression-based, hence do not need 2D keypoints or silhouette during test. We show PCK@0.15 and IOU for both coarse (ours-coarse) and refined (ours) estimations. As shown in Table <a href="#S4.T1" title="Table 1 ‣ 4.2 Results on the StanfordExtra dataset ‣ 4 Experiments ‣ Coarse-to-fine Animal Pose and Shape Estimation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>, our approach outperforms the optimization-based approaches <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite> in terms of both IOU and average PCK@0.15 even when ground truth 2D annotations are used.
We also outperform the regression-based approach <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite> for all metrics, with a relative improvement of 10.0% for IOU and 5.8% for average PCK@0.15. The fact that the refined estimation has higher scores than the coarse estimation demonstrates the effectiveness
of our coarse-to-fine strategy.
This is also evident from the qualitative results in Row 1-3 of Figure <a href="#S4.F4" title="Figure 4 ‣ 4.3 Results on the Animal Pose and BADJA datasets ‣ 4 Experiments ‣ Coarse-to-fine Animal Pose and Shape Estimation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a>, where both keypoint locations (<span id="S4.SS2.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">e</span>.<span id="S4.SS2.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">g</span>. keypoints on the right rear legs in the first row and on the face in the second row) and silhouettes are improved (more yellow pixels and less red or green pixels) after the refinement step.</p>

. We take the performance of 3D-M and WLDO from <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>. Note that the results of 3D-M is obtained by using the predicted keypoints and silhouettes for fair comparison. We can see that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art approach <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite> for all metrics, especially for the IOU score. This demonstrates the importance of the refinement step in improving the coarse estimations since the architecture of our coarse estimation stage is similar to WLDO except that we do not apply the EM updates.

For the StanfordExtra dataset, most images are taken from a front view and the dogs are in a standing, siting or prone pose.

We can see from Table <a href="#S4.T3" title="Table 3 ‣ 4.3 Results on the Animal Pose and BADJA datasets ‣ 4 Experiments ‣ Coarse-to-fine Animal Pose and Shape Estimation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a> that our approach still obtains reasonable scores given the domain gap between these two datasets, improving over WLDO by 10.8% for IOU and 11.3% for average PCK@0.15. We also notice that the performance gap between the coarse and fine estimations is larger than that of the other two datasets. This may be attributed to the domain shift of the input image, which causes the coarse estimation to be inaccurate. Nonetheless, this inaccuracy can be reduced after refinement since the refinement step does not directly rely on the input image. We can observe from the qualitative results (Row 7-8) that keypoints on the legs aligned much better after refinement. This also demonstrates the advantage of our coarse-to-fine approach in the presence of domain gap. We show failure cases in the last two rows of Figure <a href="#S4.F4" title="Figure 4 ‣ 4.3 Results on the Animal Pose and BADJA datasets ‣ 4 Experiments ‣ Coarse-to-fine Animal Pose and Shape Estimation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a>, where the camera is looking at the back of the animal or there is severe occlusion.</p>

<div id="S5.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We introduce a coarse-to-fine approach for 3D animal pose and shape estimation.
Our two-stage approach is a combination of SMAL-based and vertex-based representations that benefits from both parametric and non-parametric representations. We design the mesh refinement GCN as an encoder-decoder structure, where the input feature of each node consists of both image-level and vertex-level features. This combination of global and local features helps to capture overall structure and detailed shape information. Our approach outperforms both optimization-based and regression-based approaches on the StanfordExtra dataset. Results on the Animal Pose and BADJA datasets verify the generalization capacity of our approach to unseen datasets.</p>

<p id="S0.SS0.SSS0.Px1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We compare our coarse-to-fine approach with the test-time optimization approach. As has been done in our coarse-to-fine pipeline, we also use the output from our coarse estimation stage as an initialization. Instead of apply the mesh refinement GCN, we further optimize the SMAL parameters based on the keypoints and silhouettes for 10, 50, 100, 200 iterations, respectively. We show the average PCK and IOU in the Table <a href="#S0.T1" title="Table 1 ‣ Comparison with test-time optimization. ‣ Coarse-to-fine Animal Pose and Shape Estimation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>, as well as the inference time for the test set. We can see that the performance of the test-time optimization gets better with more optimization iterations. However, the inference time also increases linearly with the number of optimization iterations. In comparison, our regression based refinement achieves better performance with faster inference time. Moreover, the test-time optimization requires 2D keypoints and silhouettes, which are not always available in practice.</p>
