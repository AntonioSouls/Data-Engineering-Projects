<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">Indoor 3D object detection is an essential task in single image scene understanding, impacting spatial cognition fundamentally in visual reasoning. Existing works on 3D object detection from a single image either pursue this goal through independent predictions of each object or implicitly reason over all possible objects, failing to harness relational geometric information between objects. To address this problem, we propose a dynamic sparse graph pipeline named Explicit3D based on object geometry and semantics features. Taking the efficiency into consideration, we further define a relatedness score and design a novel dynamic pruning algorithm followed by a cluster sampling method for sparse scene graph generation and updating. Furthermore, our Explicit3D introduces homogeneous matrices and defines new relative loss and corner loss to model the spatial difference between target pairs explicitly. Instead of using ground-truth labels as direct supervision, our relative and corner loss are derived from the homogeneous transformation, which renders the model to learn the geometric consistency between objects. The experimental results on the SUN RGB-D dataset demonstrate that our Explicit3D achieves better performance balance than the-state-of-the-art.</p>

<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Given an RGB image, the task of indoor scene understanding is to model common indoor objects (usually furniture) and estimate their semantic category. Understanding indoor scenes has shown unique importance in various applications such as digital twin, interior design, robot navigation, and content synthesis in augmented and virtual reality. However, with the absence of depth information, inferring 3D space from 2D images is inherently ill-posed because scenes with distinct geometry structures can be projected onto identical RGB images. Besides, heavily occluded scenes even make things worse by filtering out useful pixel information for estimating position, orientation, and scale. Furthermore, in scenes with significant variations in object poses and scales, it can be challenging work to identify different objects in the real world, even for human brains. Thus, the general performance of indoor scene understanding is still far from satisfactory.

<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Over decades, researchers have been trying to consistently improve scene understanding algorithms by designing more accurate 3D object detection systems <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite> and introducing object-centric shape reconstruction <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>. The former task mainly tackles the problem of locating the center of relevant objects and predicting their spatial occupancy and orientation. On the other hand, the latter task is to reconstruct and render the objects’ shape and surface details. This paper focuses on indoor 3D detection, which is essential for further scene understanding tasks such as shape reconstruction, semantic reconstruction, and comprehensive scene rendering and optimization (as shown in Fig. <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ I Introduction ‣ Explicit3D: Graph Network with Spatial Inference for Single Image 3D Object Detection" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>).</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">A well-used approach for indoor object detection is to model relevant objects in a bounding cuboid manner <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite> and the regression parameters will be the coordinates of the cuboid center, cuboid scale, and also its rotation angles. The problem will be straightforward for RGB-D images or point clouds under the projection of a pin-hole camera model. However, for single-image scene object detection tasks, vast and intuitive depth information cannot be sensed from real-world environments. Thus, recent works are focusing on utilizing geometric <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>, pixel-level <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite> and semantic <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite> attributes in RGB images to better assist the detection task.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Although existing object-centric 3D detection algorithms significantly matured over the last decade <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>, most of them represent indoor scenes as collection of independent objects. The unique characteristic of the indoor scene detection task is that there are usually several relevant objects appearing simultaneously in a single image, and the frequency and geometry of the co-occurrence with each other can be probabilistically modeled. The insight is inspired by the theory pointed out by <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite> that human brains rely on visual priors at object-level, scene-level, and relationship-level when understanding indoor scenes. Take Fig. <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ I Introduction ‣ Explicit3D: Graph Network with Spatial Inference for Single Image 3D Object Detection" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a> as an example, if there is a bed in the scene (object-level), we can make bold assumptions that there may also be nightstands next to the bed (relationship-level), and this scene is most likely to be a bedroom (scene-level). Since we have identified the problem as bedroom scene understanding, there may also be wardrobes, dressing table <em id="S1.p4.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">etc.</em> in the image (relationship-level). Thus, it is possible to harness these probabilistic relationships between different objects to boost the performance of our detection system.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">So how to model co-occurring frequencies for 3D object detection becomes a critical issue. The natural idea is to fuse all pairwise information for object prediction <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>. Since dense pairwise connections can also be interpreted as graphs, the methods above actually reason over fully connected graphs where each object-pair relationship is a potential edge. While a fully connected graph contains all pairwise relationships, it scales quadratically with the number of objects, rendering inference over large and complex scenes quickly becomes impractical. Couples of works <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite> have tried to adopt sparse scene graph models to understand scenes. The state-of-the-art work <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite> also employs GCN-based scene graphs to aggregate object-level and contextual information in an implicit way and achieves dramatic improvements compared to dense graph-based methods, which indicates the potential of harnessing sparse scene graphs. One of the possible reasons is that by designing an appropriate attention mechanism or aggregation scheme, sparse graphs focus on more useful relational information and perform more efficient inference than dense graphs.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">On the other hand, although <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite> addresses the problem of sparse graph learning, it still needs to model shape features and contextual information in an implicit representation. In other words, implicit manners allow neural networks to learn latent information such as spatial translation and distance between different objects without explicitly considering the probabilistic geometric arrangement mentioned above.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p7" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p7.1" class="ltx_p">Thus, taking advantage of the interpretability of explicit spatial relationships and the potential of sparse graphs, we propose a novel sparse graph neural network-based method where probabilistic relationships are modeled as explicit geometric transformation matrices. In particular, we propose a dynamic graph pruning module based on cluster sampling method, which calculates the pairwise relatedness score through the interaction between geometry and semantics, and an edge message update scheme to predict the explicit spatial information between target pairs. With the above settings, we demonstrate the performance-cost balance of our graph network-based pipeline on the SUN RGB-D dataset and also extend our algorithm to holistic scene modeling tasks.

<div id="S2.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The task of 3D object detection is similar to 2D detection but lifts the 2D boxes to 3D space. Over the years, researchers have explored several commonly used data formats for 3D detection, including depth image, voxel, multi-view images, and point cloud data. Existing works can be divided into three main categories according to different data inputs: RGB images, point cloud, and hybrid data fusion. Many works <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite> have been trying to recover the 3D space from merely 2D images, and their focus is to perform detection tasks with the help of estimated depth images. Detection on point cloud <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>, <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>, <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite> extends pixel in 2D space to point cloud in 3D space, which processes point cloud directly without projection or segmentation. Data fusion methods <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>, <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite> integrate RGB images and point cloud from LiDAR for 3D object detection, taking advantage of mature 2D object detectors to narrow down the proposal search space. They extract the 3D bounding boxes by aligning 2D ones from image detectors to 3D space. In this paper, the goal of our scene understanding task is to directly predict the bounding boxes in 3D space from a single RGB image instead of explicitly estimating the miss depth information.</p>

</div>
<div id="S2.SS2.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">The shape representation task concentrates more on generating 3D shapes corresponding to the input images, which can be further categorized into three categories: scene-level reconstruction, object-wise reconstruction, and model-retrieval methods. Scene-level methods recover the 3D texture of the entire scene in an end-to-end manner without explicitly modeling each object in the scene. Most scene-level reconstruction methods adopt depth or voxel information <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>, <a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>, <a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite> to represent the whole scene. However, these algorithms often suffer from computational inefficiency, and their reconstruction resolution is also limited. Model retrieval methods <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite> mainly utilize template matching methods to retrieve CAD models which share the most similarity with the input images from the given model repository. The advantage of this sort of method is their improved shape quality over those scene-level counterparts. However, in model retrieval approaches, only CAD models in a given repository can be matched with input images, which severely limits its practical application. Object-wise reconstruction methods, on the other hand, can be more accurate and flexible since it relies entirely on pixel information of the target object and recovers the target surface in an object-centric coordinate system. One commonly used shape representation is called triangular mesh and in recent years, mesh reconstruction methods <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>, <a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>, <a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>, <a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>, <a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>]</cite> have exhibited advantages in accuracy and efficiency.</p>

The problem of generating scene graphs from images extends object detection and instance segmentation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>, <a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>, <a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">38</a>]</cite> to relationship detection and transformations of object pairs. A typical scene graph comprises objects as nodes and pairwise edges, where nodes represent instance information, and edges can represent low-level spatial information and high-level structural relationships such as affordance, supporting, surrounding, <em id="S2.SS3.p1.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">etc.</em>, between object pairs. The structural graph itself provides some of the spatial prior for supervised learning. Thus it is inherently an ideal implementation of graph neural networks. Some works have attempted to use scene graph networks to address 3D scene understanding problems such as indoor 3D object detection <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite> , scene semantic segmentation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">39</a>]</cite>, position-based object recognition <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib40" title="" class="ltx_ref">40</a>]</cite>, <em id="S2.SS3.p1.1.3" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">etc.</em> But these methods either extract 3D scene graphs directly from point clouds based on solid human spatial priors or construct a 2D scene graph by scene graph generation algorithms before inferring 3D information, which involves too much painstaking manual work to parse scenes. Besides, there have not been datasets based on graph structure designed for single-image 3D object detection. Thus, instead of specifying the high-level relationship categories (<em id="S2.SS3.p1.1.4" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">i.e.</em>, wearing on, has, holding <em id="S2.SS3.p1.1.5" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">etc.</em>), we focus on low-level spatial intuition, transformations including translation and rotation, to be specific. Thus, no scene graph generation problem or graph pre-processing needs to be concerned in this paper.</p>

<div id="S2.SS3.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS3.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Another topic that researchers are concerned about is the design of graph neural network structure. Since it is commonly recognized that reasoning over a fully connected graph with the quadratic number of connections is straightforward but computational costly, many methods recently have turned to model scenes as graph neural networks with sparse dependencies amongst objects <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib41" title="" class="ltx_ref">41</a>, <a href="#bib.bib42" title="" class="ltx_ref">42</a>, <a href="#bib.bib43" title="" class="ltx_ref">43</a>, <a href="#bib.bib44" title="" class="ltx_ref">44</a>, <a href="#bib.bib45" title="" class="ltx_ref">45</a>]</cite>. This paper focuses on graph neural networks where each node is sparsely connected with multiple edges across objects.

<p id="S3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The overview of our method is illustrated in Fig. <a href="#S2.F2" title="Figure 2 ‣ II-B Semantic Reconstruction ‣ II Related Works ‣ Explicit3D: Graph Network with Spatial Inference for Single Image 3D Object Detection" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>. The entire detection pipeline consists of graph pruning, edge message update and the prediction of 3D pose. Given an image, our model first performs 2D object detection as in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>. All detected bounding boxes constitute a dense scene graph with all nodes connecting with each other through bilateral edges. Then our algorithm prunes the connections between objects through the relatedness score matrix, which yields a sparse graph afterwards. Edge message update scheme over sparse graph is then applied to aggregate multi-lateral messages between neighbouring nodes for each object. Finally, we obtain the 3D pose of objects by decoding the node embedding and transformation prediction from the sparse graph model. We firstly introduce the 3D object detection formulation in both world system and camera system in Sec. <a href="#S3.SS1" title="III-A Object Detection Formulation and Coordinate System ‣ III Method ‣ Explicit3D: Graph Network with Spatial Inference for Single Image 3D Object Detection" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag"><span class="ltx_text">III-A</span></span></a>. We then present our dynamic graph pruning module in Sec. <a href="#S3.SS2" title="III-B Cluster Sampling and Graph Pruning ‣ III Method ‣ Explicit3D: Graph Network with Spatial Inference for Single Image 3D Object Detection" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag"><span class="ltx_text">III-B</span></span></a>. We describe our graph neural network model architecture and edge message update scheme in Sec. <a href="#S3.SS3" title="III-C Edge Message Passing Scheme ‣ III Method ‣ Explicit3D: Graph Network with Spatial Inference for Single Image 3D Object Detection" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag"><span class="ltx_text">III-C</span></span></a>.

In this section, an iterative graph update and optimization method is proposed. In our graph network, nodes are inserted as embedding features, and edges are represented as message vectors, as shown in Fig. <a href="#S3.F5" title="Figure 5 ‣ III-A Object Detection Formulation and Coordinate System ‣ III Method ‣ Explicit3D: Graph Network with Spatial Inference for Single Image 3D Object Detection" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5</span></a>. During iterations, the nodes emit their state information to other nodes while simultaneously receiving messages from others to understand its context.In this way, the node embeddings can capture self-independent attributes and scene context information. At the same time, the messages on the edges encode the interaction and relationship between the corresponding nodes. Therefore, our graph model can learn to predict both object-wise representations and pairwise relations through message passing and graph iterations. The graph iteration contains initialization, passing, aggregation, and updating steps, which will be elaborated below.</p>

<p id="S3.SS5.SSS4.p1.3" class="ltx_p">During object detection, bounding boxes of different objects should obey the rule of the physical world, which is not to have intersections. Some objects overlap in real-world environments (for example, pillows on the bed). However, here, we only focus on typical indoor furniture such as beds, tables, chairs etc. and leave out those small, movable objects. We employ a similar physical violation loss as <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite> as Eq. <a href="#S3.E18" title="In III-E4 Physical Violation Loss ‣ III-E Loss Function ‣ III Method ‣ Explicit3D: Graph Network with Spatial Inference for Single Image 3D Object Detection" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">18</span></a>. By introducing the geometric constraint in the physical world, we can penalize those bounding boxes with collisions and the greater the overlapping is, the more penalty there will be. This way, the prediction results in a more natural scene understanding.</p>

Thus their network parameters are entirely identical. While in our implementation, we use relatively fewer MLPs with fewer parameters. Regarding floating point operations, different scenes can have different FLOPS because of the different number of detected objects. We report these three methods’ minimum, average and maximum FLOPS by predicting across the entire dataset. Although <em id="S4.SS5.p2.1.3" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">Implicit3D</em> has reported higher accuracy than ours, the proposed algorithm in this paper consumes significantly less average FLOPS, indicating that our sparse network captures more useful information and improves computational efficiency through graph pruning. In fact, our method has great potential when reasoning over complicated, cluttered indoor scenes with large scene graphs.</p>

<div id="S5.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We develop a sparse graph-based approach to perform relative transformation reasoning for single image 3D object detection. The dynamic graph pruning module leverages geometric features and semantic embedding to prune the fully connected graph to a sparse graph. And the edge message update scheme incorporates both independent prediction and homogeneous transformation inference to boost the overall detection results. Extensive experiments in the paper show that our method improves the detection performance on both 3D object detection and semantic reconstruction tasks over other implicit or dense modelling methods. One limitation of our approach is that we only exploit pairwise transformation among the objects. Pursuing a more structured graph incorporating higher-order relations remains a valuable topic to be studied. It would also be promising to adapt the sparse graph model to mesh generation and layout estimation to form an end-to-end scene understanding pipeline.</p>
