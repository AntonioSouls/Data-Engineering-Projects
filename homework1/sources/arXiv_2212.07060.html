<p id="id4.id1" class="ltx_p">Utilizing the latest advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI), the computer vision community is now witnessing an unprecedented evolution in all kinds of perception tasks, particularly in object detection. Based on multiple spatially separated perception nodes, Cooperative Perception (CP) has emerged to significantly advance the perception of automated driving. However, current cooperative object detection methods mainly focus on ego-vehicle efficiency without considering the practical issues of system-wide costs. In this paper, we introduce VINet, a unified deep learning-based CP network for scalable, lightweight, and heterogeneous cooperative 3D object detection. VINet is the first CP method designed from the standpoint of large-scale system-level implementation and can be divided into three main phases: 1) Global Pre-Processing and Lightweight Feature Extraction which prepare the data into global style and extract features for cooperation in a lightweight manner; 2) Two-Stream Fusion which fuses the features from scalable and heterogeneous perception nodes; and 3) Central Feature Backbone and 3D Detection Head which further process the fused features and generate cooperative detection results. An open-source data experimental platform is designed and developed for CP dataset acquisition and model evaluation. The experimental analysis shows that VINet can reduce 84% system-level computational cost and 94% system-level communication cost while improving the 3D detection accuracy.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Throughout the world, transportation demand has increased in terms of the movement of people and goods on a daily basis. It is important to note, however, that a rapidly increasing number of vehicles has resulted in several major problems to the current transportation system, including safety <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>, mobility <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>, and environmental sustainability <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>. In order to improve system-wide performance, Cooperative Driving Automation (CDA) has emerged, leveraging recent advances in advanced sensing, wireless connectivity, and artificial intelligence. CDA enables connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) to communicate with one another, with the roadway infrastructure, and/or with pedestrians and cyclists equipped with mobile devices. In the past few years, CDA has gained increasing attention and is now considered a transformative solution to these challenges <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>. CDA applications are fundamentally dependent on object perception data from the surrounding environments, which is similar to the visual function of automated agents <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>. As the system input, perception data can support a variety of CDA applications, such as Collision Warning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>, Eco-Approach and Departure (EAD) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>, and Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control (CACC) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>.</p>

<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In the past few decades, sensing technology has made it possible for transportation systems to retrieve high-fidelity traffic data from various types of sensors. The ability of situation awareness varies among different sensors both onboard vehicles or at the roadside. Cameras can provide detailed vision data for classifying various kinds of traffic objects, including vehicles, pedestrians, and cyclists <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>. On the other hand, high-fidelity 3D point cloud data can be retrieved by LiDAR sensors to grasp the precise 3D location of the traffic objects <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>. The robust performance of radar sensors in variable environmental conditions has made them an integral part of safety-critical automotive applications <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Perceiving the surrounding environment based on intelligent entities themselves has been one of the main methodologies to promote the development of Autonomous Driving Technology (ADT) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>. For automakers, automated vehicles are now equipped with more onboard sensors and powerful mobile computing that can process the massive amount of sensor data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>. Not only for onboard sensors, but recent researchers are now also conducting some studies that use infrastructure sensors that have the capability to perceive the traffic conditions at the object level <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>. These different sensing entities can be regarded as spatially separated perception nodes (PNs) in a transportation system. Even when empowered with advanced perception methods, both Vehicle-based PNs (V-PNs) and Infrastructure-based PNs (I-PNs) have their specific and common limitations to perceiving the environment on their own. Specifically, V-PNs are inevitably limited by the occlusion of other road objects, while I-PNs are limited by the field of view (FOV) and blind zones. From a common point of view, neither V-PNs nor I-PNs themselves can perceive objects that are physically occluded or out of their sensing range. Thus to get past the bottleneck of single-PN perception, cooperation perception has emerged and is attracting increasing attention from researchers.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">From an intuitive perspective, collaborating spatially separated PNs, i.e., Cooperative Perception (CP), naturally becomes a transformative solution to improving the perception breadth and accuracy. Therefore, numerous studies have been conducted to generate the perception information in a cooperative manner <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>, <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>, <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>. In terms of the stage of sensor fusion, CP can be divided into three main categories: 1) early fusion in which raw sensor data is shared and combined <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>, 2) late fusion in which perception results (i.e., bounding boxes) from each PNs are fused <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>, and 3) deep fusion in which feature data from each PNs are shared and fused <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>. Different fusion schemes have their own merits and drawbacks. Early fusion only needs the calibration for aligning multi-source data into a unified coordinate system but requires a large communication bandwidth for transmitting data and is more sensitive to noise and delay <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite> and is difficult to fuse multi-modal sensor data. Late fusion mainly focuses on how to merge the perception results generated from multiple perception pipelines, which is straightforward but suffers from limited accuracy <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>. Deep fusion is capable of generating high-performance perception results with low-communication requirements (compared to early fusion), but the development is still in its infancy and only a few studies have been conducted <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>, <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Furthermore, due to the heterogeneity of V-PNs and I-PNs, only a couple of studies have focused on the vehicle-infrastructure CP <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>, <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>. A real-world traffic scenario is always a dynamically changing system, which requires the CP methods to be able to cope with scalable PNs. Meanwhile, from the perspective of commercial deployment, it could be extremely costly to enable all PNs with powerful mobile computing units. However, to the best of our knowledge, the CP method that considers all the aspects mentioned above is still missing.</p>

<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">Hence, in this paper, we propose a cooperative perception network named <span id="S1.p6.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">VINet</span> (<span id="S1.p6.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold ltx_font_italic">V<span id="S1.p6.1.2.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_medium">ehicle-</span>I<span id="S1.p6.1.2.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_medium">nfrastructure </span>Net<span id="S1.p6.1.2.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_medium">work</span></span>), a scalable and lightweight CP network that supports the cooperation of heterogeneous PNs. VINet mainly consists of five components: 1) Global Pre-Processing (GPP) which transforms the raw sensor data based on the global referencing coordinate; 2)Lightweight Feature Extraction (LFE) which generates deep features from raw sensor data with low-computational requirements; 3) Two-Stream Fusion (TSF) that fuses the features generated from scalable and heterogeneous PNs; 4) Central Feature Backbone (CFB) that extract hidden feature from the fused data; and 5) 3D Detection Head (3DH) that generates rotated 3D bounding boxes.

Vehicle detection results were generated by the “<span id="S2.SS2.p2.1.7" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Background Filtering-Clustering-Classification</span>” process. Then, a centroid-based tracking flow was implemented to obtain initial vehicle transformations, and the unscented Kalman Filter <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib43" title="" class="ltx_ref">43</a>]</cite> and joint probabilistic data association filter <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib44" title="" class="ltx_ref">44</a>]</cite> were adopted in the tracking flow. Finally, vehicle tracking was refined through a BEV LiDAR-image matching process to improve the accuracy of estimated vehicle speeds. Following the bottom-up pipeline mentioned above, numerous roadside LiDAR-based methods have been proposed from various points of view <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib45" title="" class="ltx_ref">45</a>, <a href="#bib.bib46" title="" class="ltx_ref">46</a>, <a href="#bib.bib47" title="" class="ltx_ref">47</a>, <a href="#bib.bib48" title="" class="ltx_ref">48</a>, <a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite>.</p>

<p id="S3.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The main purpose of VINet is to reduce the system-wide computational cost by dividing the whole perception pipeline into two phases: 1) the lightweight feature extraction, and 2) the feature fusing and processing. Additionally, perception nodes (PNs) are categorized into two types: 1) <span id="S3.SS1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Central Nodes</span> which are equipped with powerful computing devices, named the Central Computing Unit (CCU), and 2) <span id="S3.SS1.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Slave Nodes</span> which are equipped with Light-weight Computing Unit (LCU). In this paper, illustrated in Figure <a href="#S3.F2" title="Figure 2 ‣ 3 Methodology ‣ VINet: Lightweight, Scalable, and Heterogeneous Cooperative Perception for 3D Object Detection" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>, one intersection PN (I-PN) is assigned as Central Node (I-PN-C) while other vehicle-PNs (V-PNs) and I-PN-S (I-PN-Slave) are assigned as Slave Nodes. Therefore, by assigning a lightweight feature extraction pipeline to Slave Nodes, only LCUs are needed for V-PNs and the I-PN-S. Thus, the whole cooperative perception (CP) system will only need one CCU and several LCUs to make CP available for every node with connectivity.</p>

<p id="S3.SS2.SSS1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">To avoid square-level inter-node communication which requires unreasonable system-wide communication costs, GPP aims to transform the PCD from PNs’ coordinates to a unified static global coordinate. Two main advantages of GPP compared with traditional inter-node transformation can be identified: 1) only linearly increasing communication cost is required for the whole CP system, and 2) a static global coordinate can have much less positioning error compared with the ego-vehicle coordinate.</p>

<div id="S3.SS3.p1" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S3.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Although deep features via the CNN backbone are intuitively suitable for CP tasks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>, it requires that every PNs have the capability of supporting the whole feature extraction pipeline. To distinguish our lightweight feature, the features generated after the whole CNN backbone are named <span id="S3.SS3.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">dense features</span>. In one of the popular deep fusion-based CP methods, <span id="S3.SS3.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">F-Cooper</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>, dense features need to be calculated for all the involved PNs and then shared with each other. Since a CNN backbone is generally a deep neural network with a large amount of computing requirement <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>, <a href="#bib.bib57" title="" class="ltx_ref">57</a>]</cite>, deploying every PNs with powerful computing devices is a significant load for real-world implementation and commercialization. Additionally, dense features usually have a tremendous data size and thus they require powerful data compression techniques <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite> to make the pipeline feasible in terms of real-time performance, which may inevitably cause perception performance drop and/or additional computing costs.</p>
</div>
<div id="S3.SS3.p2" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S3.SS3.p2.1" class="ltx_p">To reduce the computing requirement from the perspective of sharing feature extraction, a lightweight feature extraction (LFE) module is designed in this study. Inspired by <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite>, LFE aims to generate pillar features without the involvement of the CNN backbone, which can significantly reduce the computational loads on PNs. To cope with the heterogeneity of PCD from vehicles and infrastructures, two decoupled LFE blocks, i.e., vehicle LFE (V-LFE) and infrastructure LFE (I-LFE), are designed, which have the same network structure but different parameters.</p>

<p id="S3.SS4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this section, to combine the features from scalable and heterogeneous PNs, a specific feature fusion model, called <span id="S3.SS4.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">TSF</span>, is proposed. Since the roadside sensors and onboard sensors have different locations and poses, the point cloud distributions vary based on different sensor configurations.

For instance, as shown in , two dedicated LFEs are designed for extracting pillar features based on the data from vehicles and infrastructures, respectively. A regrouping process is applied to grouping those pillar features into two groups.</p>

<p id="S4.SS4.SSS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Regarding the number of PNs, when it grows from 3 to 7, feature-based methods, e.g., VINet, PillarGrid, and F-Cooper, can maintain their performance, while EarlyFusion has an evident performance drop. One hypothetical reason is when a single object is perceived by multiple sensors, feature data is more consistent than raw PCD. For instance, if a car is perceived by two LiDARs (one from the front while another from the back), the raw PCD information reflected by this car from those two LiDARs has a bigger difference than the deep feature extracted from the neural networks. In another word, since the neural nets, especially CNN, act like a filtering process, we can infer that feature data from single objects tend to have a smaller divergence than raw PCD. Thus, feature data is also more suitable for large-scale CP systems than raw data.</p>

We categorize cooperative perception into two types: egocentric CP and holistic CP, which are distinguished by the difference in beneficial nodes. For instance, in most of the recent cooperative perception works <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>, <a href="#bib.bib54" title="" class="ltx_ref">54</a>, <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>, a basic hypothesis under these CP methods is that only one perception node is performing cooperative perception while other nodes only act as the subsidiary to provide feature information to benefit the ego-vehicle.

<div id="S6.p1" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we propose VINet, the first cooperative object detection method that is designed from the standpoint of large-scale system-level implementation. We demonstrate that for lightweight, scalable, and heterogeneous cooperative 3D object detection tasks, VINet can enhance overall mAP by 1.7% - 18.9% for car and pedestrian classes, while reducing system-wide computational costs by 84% and communication costs by 94%. Furthermore, VINet also offers a unified framework for cooperative object detection with low system-wide costs. For future work, data compression, impacts of noise levels, and latency will be further investigated to evaluate the performance of VINet under more challenging environments.</p>
