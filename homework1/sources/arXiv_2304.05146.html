<p id="id7.id1" class="ltx_p">Visual simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) systems face challenges in detecting loop closure under the circumstance of large viewpoint changes. In this paper, we present an object-based loop closure detection method based on the spatial layout and semantic consistency of the 3D scene graph. Firstly, we propose an object-level data association approach based on the semantic information from semantic labels, intersection over union (IoU), object color, and object embedding. Subsequently, multi-view bundle adjustment with the associated objects is utilized to jointly optimize the poses of objects and cameras. We represent the refined objects as a 3D spatial graph with semantics and topology. Then, we propose a graph matching approach to find correspondence objects based on the spatial layout and semantic property similarity of vertices’ neighbors. Finally, we jointly optimize camera trajectories and object poses in an object-level pose graph optimization, which results in a globally consistent map. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed data association approach can construct more accurate 3D semantic maps, and our loop closure method is more robust than point-based and object-based methods in circumstances with large viewpoint changes.</p>

<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Visual simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) is a widely used technique in the field of robotics for accurate pose localization and drift-free map construction. In SLAM systems, loop closure detection is a fundamental component that has been commonly used to reduce drift errors. Typically, the classical visual SLAM systems such as
FAB-MAP <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>, VINS-Mono <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>, and ORB-SLAM3 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite> use loop closure engines that rely on local appearance-based features <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite> and Bag-of-Words <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite> extracted from the features to recognize revisited places and reduce drift errors. Though efficient, the methods based on local appearance features face challenges in many practical applications due to imaging system noise and environment appearance variation, especially when detecting loop closure under the circumstance of large viewpoint changes.</p>

<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Typically, in classical visual SLAM systems, loop closure detection relies on local appearance-based features obtained through clustering and encoding image block intensities, based on which to represent the environment as a database of images. In the localization and mapping procedure, an input query image is matched with this database to retrieve the most similar candidates to detect whether it is a revisited scene. Loop closure detection methods based on these local appearance features are generally efficient and perform well in the cases of small scene appearance variation and small viewpoint change. However, in the cases of large scene appearance variation and large viewpoint change, such methods deteriorate dramatically. Specifically, when the camera’s view angle changes in the scene, the classical methods tend to fail since the same local features are no longer visible <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">In contrast to local appearance-based features, geometry and semantic features are more invariant with respect to the viewpoints and appearance changes in the environment. Recently, many methods have been proposed to incorporate high-level features into SLAM systems to improve pose estimation accuracy and robustness, e.g., OrcVIO <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>, CubeSLAM<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>, EAO-SLAM<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>, and SO-SLAM <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>. It has been shown that exploiting high-level features can significantly improve the robustness and accuracy of data association, especially in the condition of partial observations and occlusions. However, the spatial relationship and topological structure information of the environment, which is beneficial to achieving consistent loop closure detection and global localization, has been ignored in these methods.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">In the paper, we propose a novel loop closure detection approach based on the consistency of spatial and geometric structure. Firstly, we employ the CNN-based detector <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite> to extract the objects in the environment as high-level semantic landmarks and propose an object-level data association method to construct the object-level semantic map. We further utilize the bundle adjustment (BA) algorithm <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite> to jointly optimize the poses of objects and cameras in the multi-view of the objects. Then, we match the spatial layout and semantic properties to detect loop closure based on the object’s surrounding topological structures in the local and global maps. Experimental results have shown that our method can recognize a loop closure even when the viewpoint changes over 125 degrees. Finally, we present an object-level pose optimization to maintain the consistency of the semantic map and the camera trajectory.

<div id="S2.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Recently, many visual SLAM systems have been developed, which rely on local appearance-based features and image intensities <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>. These systems can achieve accurate mapping and localization in general environments. However, they are still vulnerable to significant changes in illumination and view angle when used in outdoor environments. Compared to the low-level features, object features are more stable and can provide richer semantic information. With the rapid advancements in machine learning, there is a growing interest in replacing low-level features with objects based on CNN models <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>, <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite> in visual SLAM systems.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">For instance, Salas et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite> introduced a SLAM framework called SLAM++, which uses dense object models to assist in mapping. However, the method relies on prior geometric information and an object database. In contrast, Grinvald et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite> and Mccorman et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite> utilize voxel-based representation to model surrounding objects without prior information. However, the requirement for dense voxel models limits the applicability of the methods. Alternatively, some methods use general three-dimensional geometric structures, such as spheres <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>, <a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite> and cuboids <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite> to represent objects in the environment.
For example, Frost et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite> incorporated object centroids as point clouds into the camera pose estimation process, while Bowman et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite> included additional object positions in the SLAM framework pipeline. However, they did not explore and look at more signals, i.e., scales and poses.
CubeSLAM <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite> is a real-time monocular SLAM system that utilizes 3D cuboids with scales and poses to construct accurate environmental models, incorporating cuboid objects within the scene. However, the data association of the method still relies on feature point matching, which tracks feature points to match the bounding box of an object and may also lead to difficulties when numerous similar objects are present in the scene.</p>

<div id="S2.SS1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">In this work, we introduce a novel object-level data association method that extracts object features from the environment using a CNN-based model <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite> and tracks them by incorporating the semantic labels, bounding box IoU, object color encoding, and object-level embedding. To achieve accurate object localization, we jointly optimize and refine the poses of cameras and objects to minimize geometric and location error. In the experiments, We show a semantic map with precise 3D objects and a globally consistent camera trajectory.</p>

<div id="S2.SS2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Loop closure is an essential component of simultaneous localization and mapping, which depends on the recurrent observation of landmarks to mitigate the cumulative errors that arise from the robot’s motion. Conventional methods <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite> typically extract and encode local point features to establish a database of images, and then retrieve images in the database. However, these point-based methods are sensitive to changes in viewpoint and environmental appearance.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Recently, many works seek to incorporate high-level semantic features to address the loop closure problem in cases with significant changes in appearance. These works represent the environment as a graph structure, and reformulate the loop closure detection as a graph matching problem. Moreover, some methods represent each image with identified objects as a graph and encode each object within the graph. For example, Kuan et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite> gather and encode the feature points in the region of the objects. Kim et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite> integrate visual points into semantic objects as kernel nodes and introduce a graph kernel algorithm to match query and target graphs. Nevertheless, when the viewpoint changes significantly and the objects are occluded, the same object is represented inconsistently in both graphs, leading to a decline in the performance of these methods.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS2.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">On the other hand, some methods leverage oriented objects in time-continuous images to construct global graphs. For instance, X-view <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite> creates 2D semantic graphs using image sequences with object segmentation. In the graphs, vertices represent semantic blobs, and edges indicate proximity relations. Graph matching is achieved by comparing random walk descriptors between vertices. These descriptors contain topological information of the semantic graph, making them resistant to seasonal and significant viewpoint changes. Moreover, some methods extend this work to edit distance matching <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite> and semantic histogram-based matching <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite>. Furthermore, the methods <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>, <a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite> utilize 3D graph co-visibility to match objects in query and global graphs. However, when there are multiple objects of the same category in the graph or the graphs have similar topological structures, random walk-based and 3D co-visibility-based methods may both incorrectly identify objects and decrease the performances.</p>

<div id="S2.SS2.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS2.p4.1" class="ltx_p">In this work, we present a novel loop closure detection method based on semantic topology graph matching.

<p id="S3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Using stereo RGB streams as input, we utilize off-the-shelf stereo odometry to acquire primitive relative poses. Concurrently, a separate thread processes the RGB frame using an object detection network to identify semantic labels, and extract 2D bounding boxes and 3D cuboid proposals. These bounding boxes are then fed into an instance-feature learning network to extract the object-level embeddings. Additionally, objects that are either out of size or far from the camera are filtered out to improve the robustness of subsequent processing. Leveraging the object semantic information, the object data association algorithm performs to match the detected objects in the local map with the objects in the global map. In case of no object in the global map is matched with the detected ones, we create a new cuboid and append it to the global map. When an object is associated, we apply the object pose refinement algorithm to fuse the new measurements into the cuboid and employ local bundle adjustment approach <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite> to jointly optimize the poses of the objects and cameras.</p>

The detector uses ResNet-101 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>]</cite> as the backbone network to extract high-level features and only takes features at scale of <math id="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="1/16" display="inline"><semantics id="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.1a"><mrow id="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1" xref="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml"><mn id="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.2" xref="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml">1</mn><mo id="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.1" xref="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml">/</mo><mn id="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.3" xref="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml">16</mn></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.1b"><apply id="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1"><divide id="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.1"></divide><cn type="integer" id="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.2">1</cn><cn type="integer" id="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.3">16</cn></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S3.SS1.p1.1.m1.1c">1/16</annotation></semantics></math>.

<p id="S4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Firstly, we represent the objects in the local and global maps as vertices and set the position of the center of the vertices in the world coordinate system. We construct the relative relationships between vertices and their adjacent vertices. Then, we perform two-stage topology graph matching to identify the correspondences between the local and global graphs based on the consistency of spatial layout and vertex properties. In the initial stage, we build neighbor topological structures and select candidate matches based on their spatial layout consistency in the local and global maps. In the subsequent stage, we compute semantic similarity and select the most similar match as the corresponding object. Finally, we mitigate the drift errors and correct the camera poses by aligning the matched objects.</p>

All the experiments are conducted on a computer with an Intel i7-9700 CPU operating at 3.00GHz and 16GB of RAM. In the first experiment (see Section <a href="#S5.SS2" title="V-B Semantic Mapping Performance ‣ V Experimental Results ‣ Loop Closure Detection Based on Object-level Spatial Layout and Semantic Consistency" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag"><span class="ltx_text">V-B</span></span></a>), the proposed semantic mapping system is compared with representative algorithms on the KITTI dataset, and the evaluation metric is the intersection over union (IoU). The second (see Section <a href="#S5.SS3" title="V-C Loop Detection Performance ‣ V Experimental Results ‣ Loop Closure Detection Based on Object-level Spatial Layout and Semantic Consistency" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag"><span class="ltx_text">V-C</span></span></a>) and third (see Section <a href="#S5.SS4" title="V-D Pose Localization Performance ‣ V Experimental Results ‣ Loop Closure Detection Based on Object-level Spatial Layout and Semantic Consistency" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag"><span class="ltx_text">V-D</span></span></a>) experiments are carried out on our collected HALV dataset to evaluate the loop closure performance in significant viewpoint-changing scenes, using the absolute trajectory errors (ATE) as the evaluation metric.

It comprises a diverse set of sensor data collected from a mobile platform in urban and highway environments, including monocular/stereo cameras, LIDAR, and GPS/IMU. The dataset contains various tasks, such as object detection, tracking, segmentation, and depth estimation, with high-quality annotations for each task. Among them, the tracking and raw sequences have been widely used for evaluating and developing algorithms related to 3D perception. Therefore, for the first experiment, we have chosen three KITTI tracking sequences labeled ”00xx” and five KITTI raw sequences labeled ”2011<math id="S5.SS1.p1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\_" display="inline"><semantics id="S5.SS1.p1.1.m1.1a"><mi mathvariant="normal" id="S5.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1" xref="S5.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml">_</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S5.SS1.p1.1.m1.1b"><ci id="S5.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S5.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1">_</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S5.SS1.p1.1.m1.1c">\_</annotation></semantics></math>0926<math id="S5.SS1.p1.2.m2.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\_" display="inline"><semantics id="S5.SS1.p1.2.m2.1a"><mi mathvariant="normal" id="S5.SS1.p1.2.m2.1.1" xref="S5.SS1.p1.2.m2.1.1.cmml">_</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S5.SS1.p1.2.m2.1b"><ci id="S5.SS1.p1.2.m2.1.1.cmml" xref="S5.SS1.p1.2.m2.1.1">_</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S5.SS1.p1.2.m2.1c">\_</annotation></semantics></math>00xx” that contain the most static objects and ground truth annotations.</p>

CubeSLAM introduces a 3D object detection approach based on 2D bounding box regression and an object-based pose estimation method. The world frame is built on the horizontal plane, and the objects’ roll/pitch angles are set to zero, which is consistent with our assumption. In our implementation, we only evaluate the objects with a detection probability greater than 0.8, as reported in the object SLAM experiments in the CubeSLAM work <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>. The performance of our method decreases slightly on two KITTI raw sequences due to relative pose drift and image sequence shortening.

The horizontal axis represents the amount of ground truth rotation between the pairs of query frames and their corresponding loop frames.

The results demonstrate that the proposed system achieves higher accuracy in four cases with a mean MSE of 0.398m, a mean STD of 0.128m, and a mean Max of 0.743m. Additionally, we conduct ablation studies on the ’w/o refinement’ version of our method to demonstrate the effectiveness of the 3D object pose refinement component. As seen from the table and figures, our proposed system significantly improves camera pose localization accuracy compared to the past feature-based and object-based methods in all cases.</p>

The runtime is dependent on the number of images and the complexity of the scenes in the dataset. To determine the runtime of different system parts, we selected the image sequence in case 1. The effectiveness of the object detector is highly dependent on the computational power of the GPU and the complexity of the CNN model. As there are many lightweight methods to achieve real-time performance on a CPU, we will not discuss them here.

<div id="S6.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">This paper proposed a novel loop closure detection method based on object-level semantic mapping. This method first extracts high-level semantic features of the environment by identifying objects, and constructs an object-level semantic map based on a novel data association method. Then, objects’ neighborhood topological structures are matched based on the spatial layout and semantic properties of the graphs. Finally, it aligns the correspondence objects and jointly optimizes the poses of cameras and objects in an object-level pose graph optimization. The proposed method is evaluated in comparison with state-of-the-art methods on the KITTI dataset and the HALV dataset. The results demonstrated that the proposed method can achieve more accurate and robust camera localization performance, especially in the cases of large viewpoint changes. In future work, we plan to explore the use of more advanced deep neural networks for object detection and segmentation to improve the accuracy and efficiency of our system.</p>
