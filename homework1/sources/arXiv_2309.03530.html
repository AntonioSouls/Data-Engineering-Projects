<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">This paper proposes a novel approach for detecting objects using mobile robots in the context of the RoboCup Standard Platform League, with a primary focus on detecting the ball. The challenge lies in detecting a dynamic object in varying lighting conditions and blurred images caused by fast movements. To address this challenge, the paper presents a convolutional neural network architecture designed specifically for computationally constrained robotic platforms. The proposed CNN is trained to achieve high precision classification of single objects in image patches and to determine their precise spatial positions. The paper further integrates Early Exits into the existing high-precision CNN architecture to reduce the computational cost of easily rejectable cases in the background class. The training process involves a composite loss function based on confidence and positional losses with dynamic weighting and data augmentation. The proposed approach achieves a precision of 100% on the validation dataset and a recall of almost 87%, while maintaining an execution time of around 170 µs per hypotheses. By combining the proposed approach with an Early Exit, a runtime optimization of more than 28%, on average, can be achieved compared to the original CNN. Overall, this paper provides an efficient solution for an enhanced detection of objects, especially the ball, in computationally constrained robotic platforms.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Mobile robots require robust, reliable, and precise object detection capabilities to effectively perform their tasks. This paper focuses on the RoboCup Standard Platform League, which involves playing soccer using the NAO V6 humanoid robot platform<span id="footnote1" class="ltx_note ltx_role_footnote"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">1</sup><span class="ltx_note_outer"><span class="ltx_note_content"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">1</sup><span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_note">1</span><a target="_blank" href="https://www.aldebaran.com/en/nao" title="" class="ltx_ref ltx_url" style="color:#0000FF;">https://www.aldebaran.com/en/nao</a></span></span></span>. The robots use its cameras to detect objects in its environment, including static and dynamic ones like a rolling ball or other robots. Detecting dynamic objects can be challenging due to varying lighting conditions and fast movements. Deep neural networks with many layers are typically used, which increases the demand for computing power, a requirement that is lacking on a mobile robot platform like the NAO V6. Precise object detection is therefore more important than recall, as it is better to miss an object for a few frames than to have false detections and focus on the wrong areas. High precision also allows for faster re-detection of an object after it is lost, because it can be relied upon a single detection.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In robot soccer, the ball is the most critical object to detect because a match cannot be won without accurate detection of the ball. Detecting a rolling ball is crucial for the robot to react quickly. Therefore, its detection was studied in this paper. Conventional preprocessing techniques, such as scan lines, are used to identify a larger number of candidate regions where a ball may be present. However, these regions must be classified with a high precision. At the same time, the exact position of the ball, i.e. its center, within this patch must be determined, since it cannot be assumed that the candidate regions are always exactly centered on the object. Typically, the candidate regions’ input data passes through a fixed neural network architecture. However, this fixed feed forward execution does not take into account that many of the patches that belong to the background class are more easily detectable and can therefore be rejected at earlier stages in the neural network.</p>

<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">This paper’s main contribution consists of two parts. First, it presents a convolutional neural network architecture designed for computationally constrained robotic platforms, which is trained to achieve high precision classification of single objects in image patches and to determine their precise spatial positions.

In the first subsection, we present the different ball detection algorithms used by several teams in the RoboCup Standard Platform League, which include the use of neural networks and specialized algorithms.

<div id="S2.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In recent years, the RoboCup Standard Platform League has seen significant advances in ball detection algorithms for the NAO robot, especially since the transition to a black and white ball in 2016. These improvements have enabled robots to better detect, track, and respond to the ball during gameplay, resulting in more accurate and efficient play combined with passes.</p>

<p id="S2.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Using a multistep process for ball detection, the B-Human team <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite> scans for ball candidates using scan lines, followed by a neural network-based classification process to identify the real ball and estimate its center and radius. Their system includes three neural networks, one CNN for feature extraction and two DNNs for ball classification and position estimation. Similarly, the HTWK Robots team <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite> uses a two-phase ball detection algorithm that involves an integral image and a deep convolutional neural network for hypothesis generation and classification, respectively. The rUNSWift team <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite> uses a new convolutional neural network to improve their ball detection recall. Their framwork’s ball candidate finder undergoes pre-processing, heuristic checks, and quality modifiers for consistent region of interest scaling. Using a candidate generator based on filtered segments and multiple neural networks, the HULKs team’s <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite> approach involves a pre-classification network for higher recall and a second classification network for higher precision. The position and radius of the ball are determined by a third neural network, which is optimized for maximum candidate throughput using a genetic algorithm. The Dutch Nao team <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite> developed an improved ball detection system, which uses a convolutional neural network for candidate generation and a field border detection system to reduce false positives. The Berlin United team <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite> proposes a two-step approach to detecting the ball used in competitions. Their approach involves finding candidates through perspective key points detection and classifying them using a measure function based on integral images. They also employ heuristics and neural networks to make the process tractable.</p>

<p id="S2.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Deep neural networks (DNNs) have shown remarkable performance in various fields, such as computer vision and natural language processing. However, they are computationally expensive and require significant resources, hindering their deployment on resource-constrained devices. One approach to address this challenge is the use of Early Exits in DNNs. Early Exits allow a neural network to terminate its inference process early, bypassing unnecessary computations for some inputs, thereby reducing the overall computational cost.</p>

<div id="S2.SS2.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">The approaches mentioned above have their unique strategies for Early Exits, and they can be categorized based on their input-adaptive, spatially adaptive, or hierarchical architectures. Input-adaptive methods dynamically adjust the network depth and width based on the input data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>.

<p id="S2.SS2.p4.1" class="ltx_p">The input-adaptive and spatially adaptive methods are particularly useful for handling large variations in input data, such as in image classification tasks with varying sizes or aspect ratios. On the other hand, hierarchical Early Exit methods are more suitable for tasks with a clear hierarchy of features, such as in object detection or segmentation tasks. This paper falls into the latter category. However, the Early Exits are utilized quite differently from those mentioned before. In our case, there are only very few examples of the positive class to be recognized, but quite a few cases of the background class. Therefore, this paper presents an approach for accelerating the classification of the background class through an Early Exit enhancement.</p>

Thereby, this work focuses on detecting the ball, which is one of the most crucial objects in robot soccer. In a worst-case scenario, where no ball is present in the image, the preprocessing stage generates up to 80 hypotheses per frame, with a mean and standard deviation of <math id="S3.p1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="30\pm 10" display="inline"><semantics id="S3.p1.1.m1.1a"><mrow id="S3.p1.1.m1.1.1" xref="S3.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml"><mn id="S3.p1.1.m1.1.1.2" xref="S3.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml">30</mn><mo id="S3.p1.1.m1.1.1.1" xref="S3.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml">±</mo><mn id="S3.p1.1.m1.1.1.3" xref="S3.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml">10</mn></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S3.p1.1.m1.1b"><apply id="S3.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.p1.1.m1.1.1"><csymbol cd="latexml" id="S3.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.p1.1.m1.1.1.1">plus-or-minus</csymbol><cn type="integer" id="S3.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S3.p1.1.m1.1.1.2">30</cn><cn type="integer" id="S3.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S3.p1.1.m1.1.1.3">10</cn></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S3.p1.1.m1.1c">30\pm 10</annotation></semantics></math> hypotheses.</p>

<div id="S3.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Now, on the one hand, this leads to the constraint that the detection must be executed with a high precision of at least 99.99%. Consequently, since in robot soccer there is only one ball on the field at a time, it also means that once a ball was detected with a high precision, processing all subsequent patches can be avoided for this frame. Nevertheless, it is imperative that the total execution time does not exceed the robot’s real-time data processing capability, which is typically 30 FPS for the cameras. Thus, it is crucial to ensure that the robot can execute other important modules subsequently to ball detection.</p>

<p id="S3.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">When designing a convolutional neural network (CNN) for detecting a ball in an image patch, the first and most important constraint considered is the execution time. For the framework running on the NAO V6, the ball detection should not exceed 8 ms in the normal case to provide enough buffer for the subsequent modules. When considering an average of 30 + 10 hypotheses per frame, this results in a maximum inference time of 0.2 ms per hypothesis.</p>

A depth multiplier greater than 1 is utilized, temporarily increasing the number of filters for the depthwise convolution and subsequently reducing them for the pointwise convolution.

For the inference of the trained neural network on the NAO V6, TensorFlow Lite is used, which is specially designed for inference on mobile edge devices.
To enable the optimizer to perform effectively, a loss function that meets the requirements of the problem is needed. Since there are different objectives in the detection process, we present a composite loss function based on the two main objectives, combined with a dynamic weighting:</p>

<p id="S4.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In order to measure the runtime on the NAO robot, we use the TensorFlow lite runtime environment. In this process, 3600 measurements were performed, and the results are shown in Table <a href="#S4.T4" title="Table 4 ‣ 4.1 Runtime Evaluation ‣ 4 Evaluation ‣ Efficient Single Object Detection on Image Patches with Early Exit Enhanced High-Precision CNNs" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a>.
It is directly evident that the runtime of the fully executed EE-CNN with 180 µs is 7.14% slower than the original CNN. Because, as can be seen in Table <a href="#S3.T3" title="Table 3 ‣ 3.4 Adding an Early Exit ‣ 3 Approach ‣ Efficient Single Object Detection on Image Patches with Early Exit Enhanced High-Precision CNNs" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a>, several new layers have been added that require additional computations. However, it can also be seen that the execution time up to the Early Exit with 64 µs needs about 62% less runtime, which enables the approach presented in this paper to gain a performance advantage and the possibility to reduce the execution time.</p>

<p id="S4.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">To compare the performance of the new EE ball detection CNN to the original CNN, we executed both on the same training and validation dataset. Based on the predicted classifications, we calculated the confusion matrix and determined the precision and recall. Results on training data are provided as additional information only. The evaluation is performed solely on validation data.
As can be seen in Table <a href="#S4.T5" title="Table 5 ‣ 4.2 Dataset Evaluation ‣ 4 Evaluation ‣ Efficient Single Object Detection on Image Patches with Early Exit Enhanced High-Precision CNNs" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5</span></a>, the original CNN achieves a precision of 100% on the validation dataset, with a recall of almost 87%. This shows that the CNN presented here is able to detect many balls with a very high precision. Also, an average deviation of the ball center with around 0.471<math id="S4.SS2.p1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\pm" display="inline"><semantics id="S4.SS2.p1.1.m1.1a"><mo id="S4.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1" xref="S4.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml">±</mo><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S4.SS2.p1.1.m1.1b"><csymbol cd="latexml" id="S4.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1">plus-or-minus</csymbol></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S4.SS2.p1.1.m1.1c">\pm</annotation></semantics></math>0.795 pixel proves the effectiveness of the presented CNN model for detecting the correct spatial position.</p>

The latter is also clear, since the Early Exit presented in this work never contributes to a preliminary classification of the positive class, i.e., the ball. Thus, only the recall decreases slightly by 0.35%.
On the other hand, the much more relevant part is shown in the last column, showing how often the Early Exit has decided to stop early. It can be seen that on the validation data set for roughly 43% of the hypotheses, a decision can be made after the Early Exit without significantly influencing the recall.</p>

<div id="S5.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The paper proposes a novel approach for object detection in mobile robots on computationally constrained platforms. The main focus is on detecting the ball in robot soccer games, where a high level of precision and real-time processing is required. The paper highlights the challenges in detecting dynamic objects in varying lighting conditions and fast movements, which requires a high level of computational power. The proposed approach can detect single objects in image patches and determine their precise spatial positions with a high precision classification. The proposed method utilizes a convolutional neural network with depthwise separable convolutions, which is optimized to achieve the highest possible accuracy while adhering to the time constraints. The paper also explores the concept of Early Exit neural networks and its potential for reducing computational costs while maintaining performance. Early Exits are integrated in order to terminate the network’s inference process early, thereby reducing computational costs. This approach is evaluated and compared to the original CNN, which shows a decrease in the average execution time by 28% for the Early Exit version, with equal precision and almost equal recall.</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Future work could focus on optimizing the network architecture further to reduce the computational cost and increase the speed of execution. Additionally, exploring other methods for Early Exits and combining them with other techniques, such as pruning or quantization, could result in more efficient and accurate object detection in mobile robots. Finally, investigating the robustness of the proposed approach to changing lighting conditions and fast movements in various game scenarios as well as a different class distribution could further improve its applicability in practical use cases.</p>
