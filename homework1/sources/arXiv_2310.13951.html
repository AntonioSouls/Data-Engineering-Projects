<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">Non-maximum suppression (NMS) is an essential post-processing module used in many 3D object detection frameworks to remove overlapping candidate bounding boxes. However, an overreliance on classification scores and difficulties in determining appropriate thresholds can affect the resulting accuracy directly. To address these issues, we introduce fuzzy learning into NMS and propose a novel generalized Fuzzy-NMS module to achieve finer candidate bounding box filtering. The proposed Fuzzy-NMS module combines the volume and clustering density of candidate bounding boxes, refining them with a fuzzy classification method and optimizing the appropriate suppression thresholds to reduce uncertainty in the NMS process. Adequate validation experiments are conducted using the mainstream KITTI <span id="id1.id1.1" class="ltx_text">and large-scale Waymo<span id="id1.id1.1.1" class="ltx_text"> 3D object detection benchmarks. The results of these tests demonstrate the proposed Fuzzy-NMS module can improve the accuracy of numerous recently NMS-based detectors significantly, <span id="id1.id1.1.1.1" class="ltx_text">including PointPillars, PV-RCNN, and IA-SSD, etc.<span id="id1.id1.1.1.1.1" class="ltx_text"> This effect is particularly evident for small objects such as pedestrians and bicycles. As a plug-and-play module, Fuzzy-NMS does not need to be retrained and produces no obvious increases in inference time.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The <span id="S1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text">prominence of 3D vision has been increasingly recognized, encompassing tasks such as 3D segmentation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite> and 3D detection, with 3D object detection in particular emerging as a pivotal aspect for autonomous driving.<span id="S1.p1.1.1.1" class="ltx_text"> Unlike 2D object detection, 3D object detection can provide an object category, spatial location, 3D size, and movement direction simultaneously, which is conducive to subsequent planning and vehicle control <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>. Thus, 3D object detection is more practical yet more challenging.</span></span></p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">As a common post-processing module, non-maximum suppression (NMS) has received extensive attention in object detection studies. Like 2D object detectors <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>, 3D object detectors can also be divided into NMS-based and NMS-free categories, determined by the presence or absence of an NMS module. NMS-based methods, such as PointPillars <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>, SECOND <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>, and <span id="S1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text">BSAODet <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite><span id="S1.p2.1.1.1" class="ltx_text">, offer the advantage of more stable network training by including the anchor size as a priority. Dense anchor boxes can then effectively improve network recall capabilities, which produces obvious benefits for small object detection <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>. <span id="S1.p2.1.1.1.1" class="ltx_text">Compared to the previous PointNet-like modules, GMPNet <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite> effectively encourages information dissemination among different grids while capturing short-term motion clues of objects. The above-mentioned works all use the traditional NMS algorithm for post-processing, and their fixed NMS threshold also brings many obvious disadvantages. Compared with these methods, the selection of the NMS threshold in our method is more flexible and can be more efficient. It works well for scenes with different densities and different numbers of objects. <span id="S1.p2.1.1.1.1.1" class="ltx_text"> NMS-free methods, such as Fa3d <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>, AFDET <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>, and Centerpoint<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>, exhibit the greatest advantages in terms of detection speed. Since there is no need for preset anchors, only the object center point, length, width, and height of feature maps need to be regressed at different scales, which greatly reduces the runtime. The primary disadvantage is that the accuracy is typically lower than NMS-based methods, which are more widely used to balance accuracy with operational efficiency.</span></span></span></span></p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Furthermore, NMS is often used to preliminarily filter bounding boxes predicted in the detection head<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>. Inaccurate intersection over union (IoU) thresholds can often result from differing categories, scenes, scales, and detected object proportions, which can seriously affect network performance. This is especially problematic for point cloud data, in which large objects (e.g., cars and trucks) are often far apart from each other in the real world, and the corresponding IoU threshold is lower <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>. In contrast, small objects (e.g., pedestrians and bicycles) can be very close in reality, and the corresponding IoU threshold is higher. Thus, candidate bounding boxes can be processed using the mathematical characteristics of 3D boxes to acquire optimal IoU thresholds <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>. However, due to the changing environment and objects, the determination of optimal preprocessing and threshold values remains challenging.</p>

<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Previous observations have suggested overlapping phenomenons between objects in space, as shown in <span id="S1.p4.1.1" class="ltx_text">Fig. <a href="#S0.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ Fuzzy-NMS: Improving 3D Object Detection with Fuzzy Classification in NMS" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a></span>. <span id="S1.p4.1.2" class="ltx_text">For example, in <span id="S1.p4.1.2.1" class="ltx_text">Fig. <a href="#S0.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ Fuzzy-NMS: Improving 3D Object Detection with Fuzzy Classification in NMS" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a></span>(a), we show two different scenarios, namely: pedestrians walking side by side and pedestrians leaning against the car, both of which will lead to overlap between the same category or between different categories. As shown in <span id="S1.p4.1.2.2" class="ltx_text">Fig. <a href="#S0.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ Fuzzy-NMS: Improving 3D Object Detection with Fuzzy Classification in NMS" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a></span>(b), when using a recent 3D object detection method named IA-SSD<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite> with a traditional NMS, two pedestrians walking side by side are mistakenly detected as one pedestrian because they are very close together, and the pedestrian next to the car is not detected. In other words, when objects are closer together, their density increases, resulting in a potentially more significant overlap. However, the strength of this overlap can vary due to the degree of association between objects of different volumes, such as pedestrians or cars. Additionally, extensive annotation can further enlarge the connections between such spaces. Different objects have varying sizes and degrees of overlap, so when performing post-processing with NMS, corresponding thresholds need to be provided. In <span id="S1.p4.1.2.3" class="ltx_text">Fig. <a href="#S0.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ Fuzzy-NMS: Improving 3D Object Detection with Fuzzy Classification in NMS" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a></span>(c), we also show the visualization effect after adding the Fuzzy-NMS module for comparison. It can be seen that pedestrians walking side by side are distinguished, and the passersby leaning against the car are also detected.<span id="S1.p4.1.2.4" class="ltx_text"></span></span></p>

<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Based on this observation, we model the prediction of volume and distribution density for bounding boxes as a mathematical characteristic for use in determining object spatial correlation. This information can provide strong prior knowledge for guiding candidate box classification in the detection process and is utilized to develop a fuzzy classification system designed to adjust the optimal NMS threshold. Specifically, all bounding boxes preliminarily predicted by the detector head are divided into three categories based on 3D characteristics, which include large-volume high-density (LVHD), small-volume high-density (SVHD), and low-density (LD). This classification is achieved by introducing the DBSCAN clustering algorithm, which is used first to estimate the density of initially predicted bounding boxes and then calculate the volume of these boxes<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>, <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>. <span id="S1.p5.1.1" class="ltx_text">Given a set of points in some space, it marks points that are closely packed together (with many neighbors) as outliers, which are located in low-density regions where the nearest neighbors are too far away. DBSCAN <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite> is one of the most common clustering methods and the most cited algorithm in the leading data mining works<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>.<span id="S1.p5.1.1.1" class="ltx_text"> Generally, we observe that higher densities produce larger NMS thresholds for small objects, allowing different thresholds to be assigned to different categories. By classifying the initially predicted bounding boxes and assigning different NMS thresholds, an optimal value can be easily selected. However, the definitions of density and volume in 3D classification tasks exhibit great uncertainty as a result, which can seriously affect detection performance. To this end, a fuzzy classification system named Fuzzy-NMS is constructed to assist each bounding box in determining the optimal NMS threshold. This fuzzy model takes the density and volume of candidate boxes as input, applies a triangular membership function to fuzzify the input, and then uses prior knowledge to establish fuzzy rules between feature vectors and corresponding categories. This method exhibits strong robustness and produces accurate classification results for different types of bounding boxes. In this process, each bounding box is assigned to a different category using fuzzy classification, and an accurate threshold is specified. The predicted scores are utilized for the final bounding box screening in the Fuzzy-NMS module. The primary contributions of this work can be summarized as follows:</span></span></p>

<p id="S2.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Currently, deep learning-based 3D object detectors are mainly divided into Voxel-based and Point-based methods based on their processing of point clouds.

The core idea of NMS is to find local maxima and suppress non-maximum. It effectively eliminates duplicate detection boxes and keeps the box with the highest confidence <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>, <a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>, <a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>]</cite>. Traditional NMS methods are often too strict in eliminating redundant boxes, and the elimination mechanism based only on the IoU threshold is not good for occlusion cases <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">38</a>]</cite>. To solve this problem, Soft-NMS <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">39</a>]</cite> and Adaptive-NMS <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib40" title="" class="ltx_ref">40</a>]</cite> are proposed. Soft-NMS <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">39</a>]</cite> uses a penalty mechanism to reduce the confidence of the detection frame whose IoU is greater than the threshold, instead of directly setting it to zero. Adaptive NMS <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib40" title="" class="ltx_ref">40</a>]</cite> dynamically adjusts the threshold according to the object aggregation and mutual occlusion, so as to realize the adaptive adjustment threshold. Similar to our idea, Decoupled R-CNN <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib41" title="" class="ltx_ref">41</a>]</cite> has noticed the influence of fixed NMS threshold on a high-density proposal in the field of two-dimensional target detection, so the corresponding NMS classification threshold and regression are dynamically changed in the experiment to explore the effect of NMS threshold on two different tasks. There are also some works dedicated to the improvement of NMS, such as OS-NMS proposed by <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib42" title="" class="ltx_ref">42</a>]</cite>. Unlike our method, which changes the threshold, this work changes the center point selection strategy of the pre-selection box, assuming that a point with a higher foreground score is more accurate and close to the center, and tends to make a more confident center prediction. And then, for each center point with a high score, the distance from it in other pre-selected centers is less than a certain value. In addition, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib43" title="" class="ltx_ref">43</a>]</cite> proposes IA-NMS, which multiplies the classification of the visible light mode by the corresponding alignment coefficient to reduce the occurrence of false alarms. Unlike our method, it mainly improves the detection results in dark scenes. NMS has also been applied to 3D object detection, such as distance-guided NMS <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite> and mathematically differentiable NMS framework with backpropagation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib44" title="" class="ltx_ref">44</a>]</cite>, for improving the performance of distance estimation and monocular 3D images, respectively. Center-Aware Non-Maximum Suppression (CA-NMS) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib45" title="" class="ltx_ref">45</a>]</cite> introduces the idea that points near the center are easier to predict the center than points far from the center, and assigns higher foreground scores to points near the center through a pseudo-label generation strategy. These studies show that the performance of NMS in different classes and overlapping situations can be further improved by directly or indirectly choosing an appropriate threshold.<span id="S2.SS2.p1.1.1.1" class="ltx_text"></span></span></p>

Fuzzy systems can imitate comprehensive human inference in dealing with fuzzy information problems that are difficult to solve with conventional mathematical methods <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib46" title="" class="ltx_ref">46</a>, <a href="#bib.bib47" title="" class="ltx_ref">47</a>]</cite>.

Fuzzy systems have also been introduced to assist in salient object detection <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib49" title="" class="ltx_ref">49</a>]</cite>. For example, Nozaki proposes an object suggestion selection and measurement mechanism involving fuzzy set theory and uses the acquired scores to detect salient objects <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib50" title="" class="ltx_ref">50</a>]</cite>. Fuzzy systems have also been used for segmentation tasks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib51" title="" class="ltx_ref">51</a>, <a href="#bib.bib52" title="" class="ltx_ref">52</a>, <a href="#bib.bib53" title="" class="ltx_ref">53</a>]</cite>. Although fuzzy methods have applications and effects in many tasks, they are still rarely applied to 3D object detection, especially in NMS. Therefore, to filter candidate bounding boxes more precisely, we introduce fuzzy classification into NMS and apply prior knowledge to help eliminate overlapping candidate bounding boxes. Some prior knowledge can be expressed by using a fuzzy classification model to subdivide candidate boxes, optimizing appropriate suppression thresholds for various categories, thus effectively reducing uncertainty in the NMS process. <span id="S2.SS3.p1.1.1.1" class="ltx_text"></span></span></p>

<div id="S3.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Existing 3D object detection networks can be divided into 3D data pre-processing, feature extractor, detection head, and post-processing modules. In this study, we mainly improve the post-processing component of the network. In other words, the proposed Fuzzy-NMS is a plug-and-play module compatible with most existing 3D object detection networks. Specifically, as shown in <span id="S3.SS1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text">Fig. <a href="#S2.F2" title="Figure 2 ‣ II-C Fuzzy System ‣ II related work ‣ Fuzzy-NMS: Improving 3D Object Detection with Fuzzy Classification in NMS" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a></span>, the input from the LiDAR point cloud is first pre-processed and then sent to the feature extractor and detection head to identify preliminary bounding boxes. The density and volume of these preliminary boxes can be estimated using the DBSCAN cluster algorithm. The proposed Fuzzy-NMS then uses these values to classify each bounding box through a fuzzy classification system intended to reduce uncertainty. Assigning different thresholds to various bounding box categories improves the resulting detection performance. Finally, bounding boxes are further filtered using scores acquired in the detection head. Fuzzy-NMS has been shown to be an effective improvement over many existing 3D object detection methods.</p>

<div id="S3.SS2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">NMS threshold selection has been shown to have an important impact on object detection performance. For example, in the KITTI dataset<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite>, if PointPillars is allocated an NMS threshold value of 0.01 (for initial bounding box prediction), it cannot identify the best threshold value for all bounding boxes with varying volumes and densities. The result is a detection box that cannot effectively eliminate duplicates. For this reason, it is necessary to assign NMS thresholds using customized criteria. This study makes full use of the mathematical characteristics of 3D information and includes these data as prior knowledge for dividing the predicted bounding boxes into three categories. As mentioned, when a bounding box is sparsely distributed, a small NMS threshold should be used to eliminate redundant boxes. In contrast, a higher threshold should be used when boxes are densely distributed to achieve a higher precision. <span id="S3.SS2.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text">Fig. <a href="#S3.F3" title="Figure 3 ‣ III-B 3D Bounding Box Classification ‣ III METHOD ‣ Fuzzy-NMS: Improving 3D Object Detection with Fuzzy Classification in NMS" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a></span> demonstrates this connection between correlation density and detection accuracy, as isolated boxes are mostly misclassified (box centers are shown in the figure). Compared with higher-density candidate boxes, there is a greater possibility for lower-density boxes to be incorrectly selected.</p>
</div>
<div id="S3.SS2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">However, in this study, predicted boxes are divided into three categories: large-volume high-density (LVHD), small-volume high-density (SVHD), and low-density (LD). In the case of small boxes, the number of anchors to be matched is much lower than that of larger objects, as most boxes near the anchors are redundant. In this case, a higher IoU threshold should be set to eliminate redundant boxes. The above analysis indicates that the density and volume of bounding boxes determine the optimal IoU threshold to a certain extent. In other words, since low-density boxes are generally sparse, dividing their volumes into two categories is not usually advantageous. Therefore, we just regard them as a low-density (LD) category.</p>

<p id="S3.SS3.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Density calculation requires the use of a clustering algorithm, which clusters the candidate boxes, measures the density of each cluster, and then uses this value to determine the density of individual boxes. Specifically, the DBSCAN algorithm is selected for this step, as it can cluster dense datasets of any shape and does not require specifying the number of clusters. In addition, it offers fast speed and effective noise processing, so it is often used for spatial data. DBSCAN categorizes points into specific categories, including core, boundary, and noise points. After noise removal, edges are established to connect core points that are less than one domain radius from the core point search space (denoted Eps). These connected core points are then formed into a cluster, and boundary points are finally assigned to the corresponding cluster radius. In this study, the center coordinates of candidate bounding boxes are used as input, and the density clustering of adjacent boxes is achieved using the DBSCAN algorithm. Box density can be expressed as follows:</p>

It can be observed from the above statistical results that density is mostly concentrated between 0-1, while the volume is distributed between 0-15. As such, feature density and volume can be divided into four fuzzy sets: <span id="S3.SS4.p8.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">ZE</span> (Zero), <span id="S3.SS4.p8.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">PS</span> (Positive Small), <span id="S3.SS4.p8.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">PM</span> (Positive Medium), and <span id="S3.SS4.p8.1.5" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">PB</span> (Positive Big).

The set contains 7,481 training samples and 7,518 test samples, primarily distributed across car, pedestrian, and cyclist categories. Detection can be divided into three difficulty levels: easy, moderate, and hard, depending on the degree of occlusion for marked bounding boxes. The mean average precision (mAP), the official evaluation standard for the KITTI 3D object detection benchmark, was used as an evaluation indicator in this study. <span id="S4.SS1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text">In addition, in order to prove the applicability of our method on large datasets, we also conducted verification experiments on Waymo Open Dataset<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite>, which is currently the largest dataset for 3D object detection of LiDAR point clouds in autonomous driving scenarios. This set contains 798 training sequences with around 160k LiDAR samples, 202 validation sequences with 40k LiDAR samples, and 150 testing sequences with 30k LiDAR samples. The evaluation of the system is conducted using official evaluation tools, employing mean average precision (mAP) and heading-weighted mean average precision (mAPH). The evaluation process involves two difficulty levels. In LEVEL 1, ground-truth objects are required to have a minimum of 5 inside points, while LEVEL 2 considers objects with at least 1 inside point as ground truth.<span id="S4.SS1.p1.1.1.1" class="ltx_text"></span></span></p>

It can be seen that our Fuzzy-NMS module has been proven to perform well on the KITTI dataset, and the baseline selection with a time span of up to five years also proves that our method is universal.<span id="S4.SS3.p3.3.3.3.1" class="ltx_text"></span></span></span></p>

TABLE IX shows the experimental results on Waymo. Similar to the results on the KITTI validation set and test set, the addition of Fuzzy-NMS allowed the model to obtain higher accuracy in the detection of the Pedestrian category, and the improvement is more obvious.

However, it is undeniable that our module also has certain shortcomings, that is, the performance on large objects such as cars is not good, and many benchmarks have not been improved. Some are even lower than the original ones. After analysis, we consider this is because the Fuzzy-NMS module classifies objects with different volume densities and selects appropriate IoU and score thresholds for each category, and when a large object like a car is driving or parking, two objects rarely overlap each other, so it is difficult to improve the accuracy by adjusting the threshold of NMS for the car category. On the contrary, small objects like pedestrians or cyclists are more likely to overlap, and the pre-selected boxes of overlapping objects are too dense, and the original NMS module often misses small objects due to setting a constant threshold. Therefore, when Fuzzy-NMS is added, the bounding box that was originally wrongly suppressed can be correctly screened out through reasonable adjustment of the NMS threshold. In real life, pedestrians and cyclists are often unpredictable in their actions and often cause many traffic accidents, so the successful detection of pedestrians and cyclists is very important in the field of automatic driving. So although our module actually doesn’t achieve good results in every category, their improvement in dense small objects is also worthy of attention.<span id="S4.SS3.p5.1.1.1.1" class="ltx_text"></span></span></span></p>

<p id="S4.SS3.p6.1" class="ltx_p">To better illustrate this comparison, the moderate results of these five baseline methods without and with our proposed Fuzzy-NMS module were visualized using a histogram, as shown in <span id="S4.SS3.p6.1.1" class="ltx_text">Fig. <a href="#S4.F8" title="Figure 8 ‣ IV-C Experiment Results and Analysis ‣ IV EXPERIMENTS ‣ Fuzzy-NMS: Improving 3D Object Detection with Fuzzy Classification in NMS" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">8</span></a></span>. In the figure, three categories, including car, pedestrian, and cyclist, were given, respectively. And the results of the baseline methods were represented by light-colored columns, while the methods with our Fuzzy-NMS module corresponded to the darker-colored columns. It was evident the performance of the five baseline models had been improved to varying degrees after the addition of our module. It was also worth noting the Fuzzy-NMS module primarily displayed improvements for pedestrians and cyclists (small objects), which was consistent with the original intention of designing a Fuzzy-NMS.</p>

We visualized these outcomes in BEV for PointPillars, SECOND, and Part-A2-Free models in ordinary highway and expressway scenes to compare intuitively. The purple rectangular boxes denoted detection results, the green dotted boxes were false detection results from the baseline, and the red dotted boxes represented missed detection results after the addition of the Fuzzy-NMS module. This algorithm helped eliminate some false detection, especially for distant sparse objects. It was worth emphasizing that each of the five models used the same parameters. In other words, the Fuzzy-NMS module, which improved the performance of PointPillars, could also improve other models (i.e., SECOND). The proposed method is a general plug-and-play module, and the resulting detection accuracy can be improved without further parameter adjustment for a given data set. In addition, Fuzzy-NMS was also compared with other famous NMS methods, including traditional-NMS, Soft-NMS <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">39</a>]</cite>, and DIoU-NMS <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib57" title="" class="ltx_ref">57</a>]</cite>, to prove the performance.

The cumulative performance of Fuzzy-NMS was superior to each of the other NMS modules.
To improve the real-time performance of the algorithm, we performed code acceleration by using C++ language instead of Python, which was presented in the form of a dynamic library. <span id="S4.SS3.p7.6.4" class="ltx_text">Finally, the run-time was about 10.08ms, which was inferior to that of conventional NMS and Soft-NMS but superior to DIoU-NMS. We also record the running time of the detector. When the Fuzzy-NMS module is not added, the complete detection process of the original PointPillars detector takes 48.10ms per frame, and the total time spent after adding the Fuzzy-NMS module is 55.38ms per frame.<span id="S4.SS3.p7.6.4.1" class="ltx_text"> These results suggest that Fuzzy-NMS is a competitive post-processing model for 3D object detection tasks.</span></span></p>

<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this study, a novel Fuzzy-NMS module is proposed to solve the problem of extensive threshold filtering in 3D object detection tasks. This method utilizes the density and volume of candidate boxes to divide them into LVHD, SVHD, and LD categories, allocating optimal thresholds for each to improve the filtering capabilities of NMS further. Adequate experiments involving the KITTI <span id="S5.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text">and Waymo datasets<span id="S5.p1.1.1.1" class="ltx_text"> prove<span id="S5.p1.1.1.1.1" class="ltx_text">s<span id="S5.p1.1.1.1.1.1" class="ltx_text"> that the addition of the proposed module can produce significant improvements on 3D and BEV mAP in <span id="S5.p1.1.1.1.1.1.1" class="ltx_text">many benchmarks.<span id="S5.p1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1" class="ltx_text"> This outcome demonstrates that Fuzzy-NMS can remarkably improve the accuracy of 3D object detection and, as a generalized plug-and-play module, can be directly added to a 3D detection framework to improve performance without the need for training. <span id="S5.p1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1" class="ltx_text">In addition, works like
