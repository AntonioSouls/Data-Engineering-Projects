<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">Camera, and associated with its objects within the field of view, localization could benefit many computer vision fields, such as autonomous driving, robot navigation, and augmented reality (AR). After decades of progress, camera localization, also called camera pose estimation could compute the 6DoF pose of objects for a camera in a given image, with respect to different images in a sequence or formats. Structure-based localization methods have achieved great success when integrated with image matching or with a coordinate regression stage. Absolute and relative pose regression methods using transfer learning can support end-to-end localisation to directly regress a camera pose but achieve a less accurate performance. Despite the rapid development of multiple branches in this area, a comprehensive, in-depth and comparative analysis is lacking to summarise, classify and compare, structure-based and regression-based camera localization methods. Existing surveys either focus on larger SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) systems or on only part of the camera localization method, lack detailed comparisons and descriptions of the methods or datasets used, neural network designs such as loss designs, and input formats, etc. In this survey, we first introduce specific application areas and the evaluation metrics for camera localization pose according to different sub-tasks (learning-based 2D-2D task, feature-based 2D-3D task, and 3D-3D task). Then, we review common methods for structure-based camera pose estimation approaches, absolute pose regression and relative pose regression approaches by critically modelling the methods to inspire further improvements in their algorithms such as loss functions, neural network structures. Furthermore, we summarise what are the popular datasets used for camera localization and compare the quantitative and qualitative results of these methods with detailed performance metrics. Finally, we discuss future research possibilities and applications.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Camera pose is used to describe the position and orientation of a camera in a world coordinate system, with respect to six degrees of freedom (6DoF), using different representations, e.g., a transformation matrix. The 6DoF can be grouped into two categories, translations and rotations: translations are linear, horizontal straightness and vertical straightness; rotations are pitch, yaw and roll. Camera pose also includes the estimation of objects’ poses in scenes or scenarios for the camera. Camera pose estimation is useful for a range of applications areas, such as augmented reality, robot navigations, autonomous vehicles. These use the camera pose for further calculations, such as object positions and scene perception. Compared with alternative location sensing devices, such as Light detection and ranging (LiDAR), Global navigation satellite system (GNSS). Camera pose estimation is easier to deploy and can be extended to some downstream high-level tasks (e.g., robot grabbing, robot navigation), where the camera determining the 6DoF can be fused with other sensors (e.g., Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) sensors, Wi-Fi). The camera localisation task estimates the 6DoF pose of the camera under a world coordinate system in relation to objects from images or videos captured by cameras. With the recent rapid progress of deep learning techniques applied to computer vision, camera pose estimation methods developed from structure-based methods (recovering the camera pose by establishing the correspondence between features in a query image and a 3D structure feature in a scene model) to regression-based methods (regressing the camera pose of a reference through a regressor by optimizing the weights of a neural network). For both indoor and outdoor environments, images or videos captured by cameras could estimate the camera pose, specifically, indoor environments require more accurate pose estimation as indoor spaces are more cluttered.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">This paper focuses on image-based camera pose estimation methods. The system inputs are from camera images, which may include RGB and/or depth images, a single image or image sequences, or videos, from moving or stationary cameras. The final output of the system is the 6DoF pose, but there may also be some intermediate stage results (e.g., retrieval stage outputs, query image related retrieval images, image matching stage outputs corresponding from image pairs) from structure-based localization methods. We divide camera pose methods into two main branches: structure-based localisation methods and direct regression-based localisation methods. In addition to introducing these methods, we also list a detailed artificial neural network analysis and internal structure comparison. In addition, this survey reports the comparison of relative datasets, quantitative and qualitative results, and gives some potential research directions.</p>

<span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_subsection">1.1 </span>Application domains</h3>

<div id="S1.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">To the best of our knowledge, there is no current in-depth survey of camera pose applications. Augmented reality (AR) technology is currently a very popular image/video synthesis technology. It can superimpose three-dimensional (3D) virtual objects outside the real environment onto images of the real environment through projection to enhance the real-time images and support seamless integration of virtual and real images. It has a wide range of application prospects, such as military training, education, games and entertainment. The precise positioning of the camera is one of the core steps of the technology, which is to obtain the 6 degrees of freedom (6DoF) of the camera. For AR-related technologies which are usually used indoors, a mobile machine-mounted camera is normally used as it moves more smoothly than a human-moving mounted camera for AR games because it avoids human body micromovements and limb movement. Combining human movements and pose estimation of the camera could improve the AR game experience and have more practical applications, such as 3D reconstruction, etc.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.SS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Autonomous driving systems need a positioning module to sense the state of the vehicle, usually input from sensors such as LiDAR and camera sensors. The perception, navigation, planning and control systems of robots or cars need copious and robust, knowledge of their location to decide the actions to do in the next step. Devices on cars or robots use sensor data to measure the pose relative to the initial pose (the camera pose when the camera starts to move) to determine the current pose and then use a matching algorithm, navigation beacons, etc. for positioning and navigation. Outdoor localization accuracy could be lower for navigation compared to those indoor environments because objects may be larger, e.g., cars and objects are further apart, although, parking and collision avoidance may need a higher accuracy. For autonomous driving, real-time localization may be important.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.SS1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Robot-related applications can use camera pose estimation for visual feedback, such as determining the position and direction of objects and helping manual visual inspections for quality control and safety inspections. It can also adaptively control the trajectory of walking robots. In addition, visual information can be used to track paths, detect obstacles, and identify signs or the environment to determine the location of the robot and avoid obstacles.</p>

Sattler et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite> focus on theoretically modelling the absolute pose regression system and compare structure-based and retrieval-based methods’ pipelines with experiments. This survey finally concludes that APR methods could be improved to compete with other methods, e.g., RPR methods, although a performance gap still exists between them. Wu et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite> model the camera localization problem as a SLAM system and presents the survey’s structure according to whether the environment is known or unknown, whether the mapping process is real-time or offline, etc.</p>

A ‘tick’ indicates whether they contain a dataset comparison, define a structure-based localization method versus an APR method or RPR method. Existing surveys tend to focus on either larger SLAM systems or only on specific camera localization methods. Existing camera pose surveys don’t tend to compare their methods with respect to datasets, and to artificial neural networks (ANNs) with respect to loss functions and input formats such as single image, image sequences and videos, in detail. Moreover, because some pose estimation methods are built upon image retrieval or image matching, our review establishes a model of a two-stage method. The first stage is to retrieve the most similar image of the reference image or to obtain the matching correspondences from the input image pair. The second stage is to regress to the camera pose based on the retrieval or matching results. This survey summarises and classifies image matching methods for camera pose estimation in the structure-based pose estimation stage and seeks to address the lack of a description of such matching or retrieval-based camera pose estimation problems in other surveys. Our survey also reviews structure-based methods and regression-based methods (including APR methods and RPR methods) concerning the analysis of ANNs including loss functions. In addition, this survey also establishes the localization focus formulation of different models, e.g.,2D-2D localization, 2D-3D localisation and 3D-3D localisation, with different multiple datasets formats (e.g., single image, image sequence, videos) and environments.</p>

The visual localization task obtains the pose within a known scene by matching a query object image in a trained model from images of objects in a dataset. According to the types of inquiry, we categorize camera pose methods into three types: (1) structure-based localization to estimate the camera pose by matching 2D pixel features to 3D point scene coordinates or to estimate the camera pose by matching the 3D pixels with a 3D map; (2) absolute pose regression-based localization to directly regress the pose from a 2D map built from an end-to-end neural network; (3) relative pose regression-based localization to regress the relative pose using retrieval methods from a geo-referenced dataset or other methods and then compute the absolute pose.</p>

<p id="S3.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Generally, for a camera pose estimation task, cameras include monocular, stereo, and RGB-D cameras that take the combination image of an RGB image and its corresponding depth image. The monocular camera applies a pinhole camera model which projects points in the real world, using an external parameter matrix from the world coordinate system to the camera coordinate system, then using an internal parameter matrix from the camera coordinate system to the pixel coordinate system. Through this reprojection process, the points in the world would be represented in an image in the form of pixels while monocular and stereo cameras generate RGB images, a RGB-D camera could simultaneously return RGB images and depth images.</p>

<p id="S3.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The evaluation approaches for localization tasks change according to the metric focus and localization methods. While evaluating the performance of camera pose estimation methods, we need to compare the computed pose from the estimation method with the ground truth pose to measure how close the estimated result is to the ground truth. Since the camera pose is associated with 3D model coordinates, the standard approach for obtaining ground truth 6DoF poses is to use structure-from-motion (SfM) tools, such as Bundler <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>, COLMAP <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>, and VisualSFM <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite> or to use such coordinated provided directly by scanning devices such as Microsoft Kinect.</p>

<p id="S3.SS3.SSS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">For the datasets that directly provide ground truth poses, the pose accuracy of a method is measured by the deviation between the estimated and the ground truth pose, two prominent error metrics for direct localization methods are the absolute pose error (APE) and the relative pose error (RPE). The APE is well-suited for measuring the performance of visual SLAM systems. In contrast, the RPE is well-suited for measuring the drift of a visual odometry system, for example, the drift per second <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>.</p>

In this section we first model structure feature-based methods. A structure-feature-based localization pipeline refers to methods to recover the camera pose by establishing a correspondence between features in a query image and a 3D structure feature in a scene model, where the 3D point-cloud model is built using structure from motion (SFM) or simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) that records the structure of the whole scene. Compared with methods that regress camera pose solely based on object features in images, a structure-feature-based pipeline is more dependent on a priori information of the 3D scene model.</p>

To match features from the scene model, usually, we can compare the distance between descriptors. We can divide features into two categories by the matching method used: direct matching and hierarchical matching. In this paper, we define direct matching methods as direct matching 2D query image feature sets with a 3D scene feature point and hierarchical matching methods as matching 2D query image feature sets with 2D scene database image features to indirectly establish 2D-3D correspondence.</p>

<div id="S4.SS1.SSS1.P1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS1.SSS1.P1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In the beginning, much work focused on improving matching methods. For 2D image features and 3D point matching, it’s unclear if any ordering of image features is better than any other. It’s time-consuming to consider all features in the query image. To accelerate 2D-3D matching. Li et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite> propose a “Point-to-feature” matching method, a prioritized point matching algorithm, which matches a subset of scene 3D points to features in the query image and is ordered by a visibility graph. Furthermore, they accelerate search steps by compressing the 3D scene model. Rather than delete images in the database, they found the smallest point cloud subset covers each image at least K times. But Sattler et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite> believe that “Feature-to-point” matching methods also reduce the long-term matching process time. They propose a priority matching method termed Vocabulary-based Prioritized Search (VPS) to speed up descriptor matching. They processed the features in ascending order of their matching costs (starting with features whose activated visual words contain only a few descriptors). Following this, they discussed the advantages and disadvantages of 2D-3D, 3D-2D matching <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>. Feature points in query images are several orders of magnitude less than those in the model. 3D-2D matching is more effective, but the location accuracy can be lost. 2D-3D matching can filter out wrong matches using a ratio test <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>. But for a crowded feature space in a large scene model, it is hard to filter out fuzzy matches using a higher threshold of the ratio test. Sattler et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite> proposed an Active Search method that combines 2D-3D and 3D-2D matching. After finding a 2D-to-3D pair, they actively search for 3D-to-2D correspondences for the 3D points closest to the matched point. They used coarse-level features in the vocabulary tree <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite> to recover matches. Sattler et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite> compressed the model by quantizing the point descriptors to achieve run-time localization. By assigning different labels to 3D points, they could use a loose matching strategy to create a locally unique matching set. Similarly, Feng et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite> use a binary descriptor combined with features from accelerated segment test (FAST) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite> feature point detection to complete feature extraction and proposed an improved binary descriptor retrieval method. They assigned the label information of multiple features to the same 3D point and constructed a supervised trained Random-Forest to complete the matching step. Based on <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>, Sattler et al. proposed an efficient and effective pipeline. This pipeline uses quantitative feature descriptors to accelerate 2D-3D matching, and 3D-2D matching methods to recall the matching loss due to quantization. In a large-scale environment, similar or repeated feature points always lead to location determination failures. To build a more efficient localization system, Liu et al. proposed a method <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite> that uses global context information to solve this problem. This not only focuses on point-to-Feature 2D-3D matching but jointly processes the feature set of the query graph and the corresponding candidate matching set using a Random Walk with Restart (RWR) algorithm <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite>.</p>

<div id="S4.SS1.SSS1.P1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS1.SSS1.P1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Except for improving matching methods, some work used additional information or outlier filter methods to improve localization accuracy. Svarm et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite> proposed a reliable and tractable outlier rejection scheme that can handle massive amounts of outliers in data. Linus also proposed using vertical coordinates to improve 3D localization <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite>. Similar to <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite>, rather than to just improve the matching precision, this takes a different approach. This allows a matching scheme to generate a large number of matches, whether correct or incorrect, to ensure that no matching matches are missed. Then, they proposed a voting-based geometric verification process, which uses a priori information concerning the direction of gravity and the height of the camera, to filter outliers.</p>

<p id="S4.SS1.SSS1.P2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">For RGB-D images or stereo systems, we need to match 3D points with the scene point cloud model. Without any already defined descriptors, we usually use the iterative closest point (ICP) method to match 3D points. Except directly using the spatial information, we can still extract features such as shape, density, etc. By comparing descriptors, we can establish a 3D-3D correspondence. Approaches such as <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>, <a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite> are classic low-level hand-crafted geometric 3D feature descriptors. Choi et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite> use such descriptors for 3D reconstruction to achieve considerable results. But these descriptors can be unstable or inconsistent when used in real-world partial surfaces from 3D scanning data and are difficult to adapt to new datasets. 3D-ShapeNet used 3D deep learning to model point cloud shapes <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite>.

For direct matching methods, we need to search each 3D point for a query feature, which is not efficient. Although many papers try different ways to improve efficiency and accuracy, they still show a fragile robustness for repetitive local features in the matching process. We aim to substantially increase the robustness of the localization while retaining tractable computational requirements, e.g., the calculation amount cannot exceed the model load and can deal with a certain amount of feature repeatability. Therefore, a coarse-to-fine hierarchical localization paradigm <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>]</cite> is proposed to solve this problem. as shown in Figure <a href="#S4.F3" title="Figure 3 ‣ 4.1.2 Hierarchical matching methods ‣ 4.1 Matching based localization ‣ 4 Structure feature-based localization methods ‣ A Critical Analysis of Image-based Camera Pose Estimation Techniques" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a>.</p>

By only estimating correspondences in this subset, they can achieve real-time localization in large-scale datasets. But the robustness of retrieval-based methods is limited by the poor invariance of hand-crafted local features. Recent features emerging from convolutional neural networks (CNN) exhibit far better robustness at a lower computation cost. The pipeline of a hierarchical approach is simple and effective. It follows image retrieval, co-visibility (meaning that two images see common areas), clustering and local feature matching.</p>

<p id="S4.SS1.SSS2.P1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We address the image retrieval problem as follows, given a query image, a system should efficiently retrieve similar images from the database. Retrieval systems have matured to incorporate spatial verification <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib40" title="" class="ltx_ref">40</a>, <a href="#bib.bib41" title="" class="ltx_ref">41</a>, <a href="#bib.bib42" title="" class="ltx_ref">42</a>]</cite> and query expansion <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib43" title="" class="ltx_ref">43</a>, <a href="#bib.bib44" title="" class="ltx_ref">44</a>]</cite>. Over more recent years, several image clustering methods based on local features have been proposed, such as Bag-of-Words (BoW) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib45" title="" class="ltx_ref">45</a>]</cite>, Vector of Local Aggregated Descriptors (VLAD), etc. For local aggregation retrieval methods that rely on local features but ignore global contextual information, these tend to show a poor performance when repeated local features appear in a large dataset. Since Krizhevsky et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib46" title="" class="ltx_ref">46</a>]</cite> show the advantage of learning-based features, further research followed that used CNN layer activations as off-the-shelf image descriptors that appear as objective results in retrieval tasks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib47" title="" class="ltx_ref">47</a>, <a href="#bib.bib48" title="" class="ltx_ref">48</a>]</cite>. Following classic retrieval approaches, such work uses CNN to aggregate local features <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib49" title="" class="ltx_ref">49</a>, <a href="#bib.bib50" title="" class="ltx_ref">50</a>]</cite>. Chum et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib49" title="" class="ltx_ref">49</a>]</cite> use a classification network followed by the use of a Maximum-Activations-of-Convolutions (MAC) layer to extract feature vectors. This used a 3D model reconstructed by unlabeled images to produce a training dataset. In addition, this proposed a search strategy to find hard positive and hard negative image pairs for training which can impact the results. Arandjelovic et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib50" title="" class="ltx_ref">50</a>]</cite> proposed NetVLAD on the basis of VLAD <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib51" title="" class="ltx_ref">51</a>]</cite>, as a trainable VLAD layer. They used Google street view<span id="footnote1" class="ltx_note ltx_role_footnote"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">1</sup><span class="ltx_note_outer"><span class="ltx_note_content"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">1</sup><span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_note">1</span>See https://www.google.com/streetview/</span></span></span> to produce a weakly supervised dataset. For a less accurate location ground truth obtained by global navigation satellite systems (GNSS), triplet-loss is used to ensure that the feature distance of all positive images should be smaller than the feature distance of all negative images. Similarly, with NetVLAD, Radenović et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib52" title="" class="ltx_ref">52</a>]</cite> also train their model using hard positive and hard negative through triplet-loss. After extracting dense features through FCN, they used a Generalized-mean pooling layer (GEM) to generate global features. Not only is triplet loss used to learn spatial information, but this approach also exploits the use of second-order spatial attention <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib53" title="" class="ltx_ref">53</a>]</cite> in descriptor learning and combines it with second-order descriptor loss to improve the learning global image representation. All of the approaches mentioned above used triplet loss to train the network by accurate location information obtained by the SfM model. Revaud et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib54" title="" class="ltx_ref">54</a>]</cite> proposed a method to directly optimize the global retrieval ranking. The author used listwise ranking loss to directly optimize mAP (mean average precision). For the computational memory requirement, a multi-stage backpropagation method was proposed to train the network. In contrast to the above method, DELF <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib55" title="" class="ltx_ref">55</a>]</cite> used image classification labels to supervise metric learning. The main innovation is, after extracting dense local features through CNN, they used a landmark classifier to focus on extracting key points and descriptors. Finally, global features are generated through an FCN layer. Teichmann et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib56" title="" class="ltx_ref">56</a>]</cite> proposed regionally aggregated match kernels to leverage selected image regions and produce a discriminative image representation. Husain et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib57" title="" class="ltx_ref">57</a>]</cite> proposed an approach REMAP, to ensemble the multi-resolution region-based features, which explicitly employs regions discriminative power, measured using Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence values, to control the aggregation process. All these Global-Single-Pass methods, use global descriptors generated by a single forward-pass through a CNN, have been designed to focus on global contextual information for robust and discriminative global feature descriptors.</p>

First, a keypoint detection is performed then the feature descriptor are extracted around proposed key points. A good local feature typically should be robust and invariant against scale transformation, rotation, and viewpoint, changes. At the start, handcrafted keypoint detectors (such as SIFT, Harris or SUSAN) used gradient and other information to detect key points. This is feasible but can be considered too computationally intensive for use in real-time applications. To accelerate the detection step, Rosten et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib58" title="" class="ltx_ref">58</a>]</cite> proposed FAST which was one of the first attempts to use machine learning to derive a corner keypoint detector. Further work extended FAST by adding a descriptor <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib59" title="" class="ltx_ref">59</a>]</cite>, or orientation estimation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib60" title="" class="ltx_ref">60</a>]</cite>. Verdie et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib61" title="" class="ltx_ref">61</a>]</cite> proposed a new regression-based approach to extract feature points that are repeatable under drastic illumination changes. Lenc et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib62" title="" class="ltx_ref">62</a>]</cite> introduce a novel learning formulation for covariant detectors. They proposed to cast detection as a regression problem, then derived a covariance constraint that can be used to automatically learn. Zhang et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib63" title="" class="ltx_ref">63</a>]</cite> extend the covariant constraint proposed by <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib62" title="" class="ltx_ref">62</a>]</cite> by defining the concepts of standard patch and canonical features, which makes the learning process more robust and less sensitive to the initialization setting. Since it is often unclear what points are ”interesting”, human labelling cannot be used to find a truly unbiased solution. Savinov et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib64" title="" class="ltx_ref">64</a>]</cite> cast detection as an unsupervised formulation. They trained a neural network that maps an object point to a single real-valued response and then ranked points according to this response. DeTone et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib65" title="" class="ltx_ref">65</a>]</cite> presented a point tracking system powered by two deep convolutional neural networks MagicPoint and MagicWarp. After that, MagicPoint was extended in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib66" title="" class="ltx_ref">66</a>]</cite> to Superpoint. After detecting the key point, the next step is to extract the descriptor on a sparse set of key points. In the beginning, most work focused on learning descriptors from image patches. Zagoruyko et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib67" title="" class="ltx_ref">67</a>]</cite> use Siamese CNN networks to learn discriminant patch representations from a large set of known pairs of corresponding and non-corresponding patches. Han et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib68" title="" class="ltx_ref">68</a>]</cite> proposed MatchNet as a deep convolutional network that extracted features from patches and a network of three fully connected layers that computed the similarity between the extracted features. They converted the descriptor regression task into a classification problem under a cross-entropy loss. Simo-Serra et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib69" title="" class="ltx_ref">69</a>]</cite> proposed a strategy of aggressive mining of hard positives and negatives on multi-view stereo (MVS) datasets. They also used a Siamese network architecture that employed two CNNs with identical parameters to compare pairs of patches and to treat the CNN outputs as patch descriptors. Besides patch correspondence-based learning, the descriptor is usually trained by a metric loss, such as the triplet loss or a contrastive loss. Balntas et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib70" title="" class="ltx_ref">70</a>]</cite> proposed to utilize triplets of training samples, together with in-triplet mining of hard negatives. In addition, they discussed the loss functions when learning with triplets or pairs and investigated their characteristics. L2-Net <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib71" title="" class="ltx_ref">71</a>]</cite> focused only on the relative distance which makes positive pairs become the nearest to each other for L2 distance. Mishchuk et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib72" title="" class="ltx_ref">72</a>]</cite> proposed HardNet to minimize the distance between the matching descriptor and the closest non-matching descriptor. They proved that their proposed loss is better than complex regularization methods. Tian et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib73" title="" class="ltx_ref">73</a>]</cite> proposed SOSNet with a novel regularization term, named Second Order Similarity Regularization (SOSR). This not only forces the distances between matching descriptors to decrease or distances between nonmatching ones to increase, but it also forces the distances between nonmatching descriptors’ distances respectively to be equal. Wang et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib74" title="" class="ltx_ref">74</a>]</cite> proposed a weakly-supervised framework CAPS that can learn feature descriptors solely from relative camera poses between images. They translate relative camera poses into epipolar constraints between image pairs and enforce the predicted matches to obey this constraint.</p>

To train the network end-to-end, they design a two-branch network and optimize by confining it to one branch, while preserving differentiability in the other. SuperPoint <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib66" title="" class="ltx_ref">66</a>]</cite>, created a large dataset of pseudo-ground truth interest point locations in real images, supervised by the interest point detector itself.

Other than only learning key points, a descriptor R2D2 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib77" title="" class="ltx_ref">77</a>]</cite> is used to train a predictor of the local descriptor discriminator. They argued that salient but discriminative regions can harm performance.

Such a common pipeline was then improved via reprojection loss <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib89" title="" class="ltx_ref">89</a>, <a href="#bib.bib90" title="" class="ltx_ref">90</a>, <a href="#bib.bib91" title="" class="ltx_ref">91</a>]</cite>. Cai et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib92" title="" class="ltx_ref">92</a>]</cite> use multi-view geometric constraints to enable unsupervised learning. Brachmann et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib93" title="" class="ltx_ref">93</a>]</cite> proposed a joint classification regression forest which is trained to predict scene identifiers and scene coordinates. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib94" title="" class="ltx_ref">94</a>]</cite>, scene coordinate regression is formulated as two separate tasks of object instance recognition and local coordinate regression. Applied to different scenes without any retraining or adaptation, SANet <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib95" title="" class="ltx_ref">95</a>]</cite> proposed a method to extract a scene representation from some reference scene images and 3D points, instead of encoding specific scene information in network parameters.</p>

According to the principle of whether the input of the network is a single image, image sequence or video, the absolute camera pose regression is introduced in three parts. i.e., absolute pose regression through single monocular image, absolute pose regression with image sequences auxiliary, and absolute pose regression through video.</p>

<p id="S5.SS1.SSS1.P2.p6.1" class="ltx_p">To improve the localization performance and to understand the model uncertainty, a Bayesian CNN <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib97" title="" class="ltx_ref">97</a>]</cite> with Bernoulli distributions has been proposed. The main contribution of the Bayesian CNN is in extending PoseNet to a Bayesian model which can determine the uncertainty of localization. To implement this, dropout layers were added after the sub-net and final output layer to get the stochastic pose samples The evaluation showed that there is a strong correlation between the uncertainty estimation and location error, so uncertainty can be used to predict the location error. This improves PoseNet’s relocalization accuracy for indoor and outdoor scenes.</p>

Four LSTM units are used in the up, down, left and right directions respectively. This method outperforms PoseNet by almost 30% for the positional error and 55% for the orientation error. LSTM is also applied to temporally improve localization accuracy using image sequences, which will be introduced in the next part.</p>

From which we can see that the modified GoogLeNet, ResNet34, ResNet-18 and VGG16 pre-trained with classification task (such as on ImageNet or Places datasets) are popular choices as the encoder of the APR network. A dropout layer is added in some methods (Bayesian and PVL) to help compute probability distribution or prior guided mask, while an LSTM module is applied to offer temporal information auxiliary. An attention module is also widely utilized to force the network to focus on geometrically robust objects. The localizer part in all the methods has at least a regressor to output the translation and orientation information, in which the 4-D quaternion is normalized to a unit length.</p>

<p id="S5.SS1.SSS1.P3.p4.1" class="ltx_p">The research of applying the loss function tends to be automatic, hyperparameter-free and more informative to reduce the use of empirical fixed parameters. A fixed loss function computes the translation and orientation sum using a balance factor to balance different weighted items, which requires a long time to optimize the loss of the training data. Later a learnable loss <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib103" title="" class="ltx_ref">103</a>]</cite> was proposed by adding homoscedastic uncertainty to automatically balance the translation and orientation loss, which avoids using hyperparameters and surpasses the performance of the fixed loss methods. Apart from fixed loss and learnable loss methods, other methods proposed the use of reprojection error loss and GPoseNet loss to add other information formats. e.g., a probability distribution of the output pose, to improve the loss function.

<p id="S5.SS1.SSS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Another method to regress absolute pose is for auxiliary learners to use image sequences. Auxiliary learning refers to the combination of using absolute pose regression and auxiliary task constraints (e.g., visual odometry). Loss functions in auxiliary learning methods usually consist of APR loss and auxiliary tasks loss. All the above-mentioned methods can be used to get the absolute camera pose. They may even use relative pose regression loss in the pipeline.</p>

<p id="S5.SS1.SSS2.P1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Traditional structure-based methods still have advantages over deep neural networks. Therefore, absolute pose regression with images sequences using auxiliary learning, has been proposed. Unlike methods using single images, auxiliary learning through image pairs, typically learn the absolute pose by firstly estimating the relative pose with which auxiliary constraints. This could involve globally consistent pose predictions to improve the localization performance, i.e., to reduce positioning error and to improve positioning robustness.</p>

The network is formed by using GoogLeNet Inception <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib115" title="" class="ltx_ref">115</a>]</cite> without using fully connected layers to extract image features, and a bidirectional LSTM module to model temporal information with memory cells and several gates. Adopting a LSTM network with a bidirectional model could use two hidden states to process this, forwards and backwards. This could also be concatenated with a single hidden state to get the camera pose. The network loss of VidLoc is computed by a weighted sum of translation and orientation error from the output of LSTM as follows.</p>

Not only using the absolute pose loss, VidLoc, the visual odometry loss is also computed to improve estimation quality in MapNet. The method also integrates IMU and GNSS data to help improve pose regression. This fuses the labeled data and unlabeled data from VO or sensors for self-supervised learning and demonstrates a better performance under challenging conditions, e.g., appearance changes.</p>

<div id="S5.SS1.SSS4.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.SS1.SSS4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this part, we discussed the work of 2D-to-2D absolute pose (consisting of localization and orientation) regression using deep neural networks entirely and using no image queries. Recent work shows that the APR methods can suffer from less accuracy, and from overfitting, compared to structure-based methods. These could be used in scene-specific environments, with the emergence of relative pose regression-based localization methods. The training process could be generally used in multiple scenes <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>.</p>

<p id="S5.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">A direct absolute camera pose regression model learns the mapping from images of objects’ pixels to camera poses, which is decided by the coordinate system that the specific scenes are in. Thus, cross-scene learning brings a coordinates transfer that is bounded and that delivers learnable physical geometric knowledge. In contrast to scene-specific absolute pose regression, relative camera pose regression methods compute a reference image’s relative pose and are trained on general multi-unseen scenes to increase the scalability in an end-to-end manner.</p>

The input of the method is a query image and an image database including ground truth poses. A set of image pairs is utilized to regress the relative pose through a Siamese network with two modified ResNet34 branches with a fixed loss function. The nearest neighbor image to the query image could be computed through a feature extractor formed by the network branch, then the relative pose and neighbor’s ground truth pose could be fused to get the absolute pose of the query image.</p>

Relative pose loss learns the differential pose between two pose matrices using a representation of matrix for rotation and translation. The training loss in which, frustum loss learns the image pair overlaps is defined as follows.</p>

A Siamese modified ResNet34 network with a fixed matching layer (EssNet) and a Neighborhood Consensus matching layer (NC-EssNet) is learned to produce a matching score map for a further regression, essential matrix. The loss function optimizes the Euclidean distance between the essential matrix with two 9D vectors (where a 3 × 3 matrix becomes one 9D vector)</p>

Through these results, we can see that structure-based localization methods generally surpass camera pose regression methods. From the absolute pose regression and relative camera pose regression methods results, we see that improving the neural network architecture, optimizing the loss function through adding more information such as providing sequential images or video, adding geometric-aware temporal constraints, semantic constraints, can improve the localization performance.</p>

<p id="S6.SS3.p2.3" class="ltx_p">Structure feature-based localization methods rely on the correspondence between the 2D query feature and the 3D model. Matching based methods establish the correspondences between 3D point cloud in scene model and 2D query image feature by matching feature descriptor. Camera localization algorithm applications are quite mature. But they are still fragile for those repetitive local features and there remains the issue that they have a high computational requirement. Most of the work focuses on robust feature points or accurate feature descriptors under extreme conditions in 2D images. We should consider the constraints of 3D spatial geometry for the 2D feature in further complex applications, e.g., most existing scene coordinate regression methods can only be adopted on small-scale scenes. They have not yet proven their capacity in large-scale scenes. For robustness or precision, accuracy or efficiency, we need to think carefully about the trade-offs.

An effective complementary combination of different sensor information can help build a more accurate and powerful positioning system. To achieve this, multiple sensor data fusion needs to overcome the challenge of heterogeneous characteristics of multiple sensor data. This kind of multi-modal task can merge different features by learning the joint contribution of every single task, or through learning the cross-coding between different tasks for more efficient positioning.</p>

It is limited under some challenging conditions, such as weak texture, illumination, weather, etc. But we can also use multi-features to improve localization. For example, some SLAM researchers used line or plane features to estimate camera pose and get a very impressive result. Maybe we can use CNN to improve the process of extracting line or plane features, and then design an efficient matching pipeline for all kinds of features.</p>

Semantic plays an important role in real-world scenes <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>. With the help of semantic information, we can easily filter out those features on dynamic objects that affect the localization result. And we can also verify the location by comparing the semantic information between scene and query image which means we need to build a semantic 3D scene model. Semantic information is an upper-level feature. Constructing a semantic three-dimensional model of the scene can not only assist in localization but also be useful for the wider application level.</p>

However, multiple images output by multiple cameras requires feature calculation during feature matching. One of the future research and development directions may be to use deep learning to resolve the features of multiple cameras end-to-end and speed up the feature calculation time.</p>

<div id="S7.SS2.SSS5.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S7.SS2.SSS5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In many specific positioning tasks, how to effectively improve positioning performance in challenging scenarios is a key step in building an accurate positioning system. For example, environmental changes caused by illumination, blur, and occlusion changes make the feature extraction of images less accurate. Further, the position changes of dynamic objects between different frames of images also cause interference to matching between images. In the future, we can explore methods such as using the relationship between multiple frames of images and adding other auxiliary judgment information to solve these challenges to improve the robustness of the positioning model in a variety of scenarios.</p>

<div id="S7.SS2.SSS6.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S7.SS2.SSS6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In the future, applications that use camera positioning assistance will develop towards being small and lightweight, which will be more quickly and conveniently applied to small portable devices, such as embedded devices or mobile phones. In addition, algorithm applications on small ICT resource devices could use methods such as model acceleration to optimize model calculation speed, model size, and consumption of computing resources, to better integrate with device functions to serve applications such as navigation, sports, teaching, entertainment. In addition, the use of mobile phones and other devices with cameras and other sensor fusions requires the development of more augmented reality functions to serve smart navigation, guided services, and immersive games.</p>
