<p id="id2.id1" class="ltx_p">Few-shot object detection (FSOD) identifies objects from extremely few annotated samples. Most existing FSOD methods, recently, apply the two-stage learning paradigm, which transfers the knowledge learned from abundant base classes to assist the few-shot detectors by learning the global features. However, such existing FSOD approaches seldom consider the localization of objects from local to global. Limited by the scarce training data in FSOD, the training samples of novel classes typically capture part of objects, resulting in such FSOD methods cannot detect the completely unseen object during testing. To tackle this problem, we propose an Extensible Co-Existing Attention (ECEA) module to enable the model to infer the global object according to the local parts. Essentially, the proposed module continuously learns the extensible ability on the base stage with abundant samples and transfers it to the novel stage, which can assist the few-shot model to quickly adapt in extending local regions to co-existing regions. Specifically, we first devise an extensible attention mechanism that starts with a local region and extends attention to co-existing regions that are similar and adjacent to the given local region. We then implement the extensible attention mechanism in different feature scales to progressively discover the full object in various receptive fields. Extensive experiments on the PASCAL VOC and COCO datasets show that our ECEA module can assist the few-shot detector to completely predict the object despite some regions failing to appear in the training samples and achieve the new state of the art compared with existing FSOD methods.</p>

We consider that base classes contain adequate training samples to capture the complete semantic object, even though each training sample may contain only part of the objects. Therefore, we propose an extension mechanism to gradually associate object parts to infer the complete object and transfer the extensible ability from base classes to novel classes to infer the co-existing features that are unseen object parts in the training stage.

<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Most existing FSOD methods, recently, apply the two-stage learning paradigm, which transfers the knowledge learned from abundant base classes to assist the few-shot detectors by learning the global features.

<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">However, such FSOD approaches <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite> seldom consider the localization of objects from local to global.

This inevitably causes the model to excessively focus on the head of the dog and ignore the unseen object parts, resulting in only the dog’s head can be detected for test samples.

<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we consider transferring information from base classes to novel classes. Unlike novel classes, base classes contain adequate training samples to capture the complete semantic object, even though each training sample may contain only part of the objects. As shown in Fig. <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ I Introduction ‣ ECEA: Extensible Co-Existing Attention for Few-Shot Object Detection" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>, base classes contain a large number of training samples for zebra. Although each sample may only capture parts of the zebra, all training samples together represent the whole zebra, if the model with extensible ability can effectively detect the complete zebra during testing. Extensible models trained with sufficient data have such ability because the model learns to associate object parts that co-exist within the same semantic class. Therefore, even though some parts of the object are hard to be detected during testing, the Extensible model can extend the easily detected region to co-existing regions to detect the complete object, as shown in Fig. <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ I Introduction ‣ ECEA: Extensible Co-Existing Attention for Few-Shot Object Detection" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a> (bottom).</p>

<div id="S2.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Extensive works have investigated mainstream object detection methods <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>, <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite> from different perspectives that could be grouped into two categories of one-stage detectors and two-stage. In general, one-stage-based object detection methods, e.g., YOLO  <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>, <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite> and SSD <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite>, only need to predict the anchors in a batch of images once before the regression and classification layer to achieve ideal performance. In contrast, two-stage object detectors, e.g., Faster R-CNN <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite> and Fast R-CNN <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite>, first generate a series of anchors by using region proposal network (RPN) from the feature images and then perform region proposals classification and regression. Such two-stage detectors supplement RPN modules which negatively impact detection speed but tend to have higher detection performance compared with the former methods <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite>. However, these mainstream researches rely on abundant annotated data, which may not bring a positive influence in data-scarce scenarios.</p>

<div id="S2.SS2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">To solve the negative detection effects of scarce annotated samples, FSOD methods have increasingly received attention. They are roughly categorized into two types, namely, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>, <a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>, <a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>, <a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite> being the meta-learning-based methods and <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>, <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>, <a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite> being the transfer-learning-based methods.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">As for meta-learning-based methods, FSRW <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite> introduces a meta-feature learner and a lightweight feature reweighting module to reorganize the detector which enables the model to quickly adapt to novel categories. Different from FSRW, Meta R-CNN <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite> only uses the meta-learning paradigm in the region of interest (ROI) features which are fused with the support branch to obtain the category attention vectors. Xiao<span id="S2.SS2.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic"> et al</span>. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>]</cite> further improved the fusion network based on Meta R-CNN to obtain better detection performance. Furthermore, compared with the above CNN-based methods, some transformer-based meta-learning FSOD methods achieve better performance. For instance, Zhang <span id="S2.SS2.p2.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al</span>. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>]</cite> proposed Meta-DETR based on Deformable DETR <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>]</cite>, which combines with transformer and meta-learning to ease the dependence on RoI. Han <span id="S2.SS2.p2.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al</span>. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite> proposed a Fully Cross-Transformer based model to optimize the few-shot similarity learning between the two branches.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS2.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Concerning transfer-learning-based FSOD, TFA uses cosine similarity to measure the relevance between the candidate anchors and the ground truth bounding boxes in the fine-tuning stage. There have many followed-up kinds of research based on this simple and effective method. Sun <span id="S2.SS2.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al</span>. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite> considered that the candidate boxes with different scores of Intersection over Union (IoU) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>]</cite> are similar to intra-class data augmentation. Based on this fact, they proposed FSCE which doubles the maximum number of candidate boxes processed by NMS <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">38</a>]</cite> and halves the number of boxes used for loss calculation in ROI. According to the existing semantic relations between different categories, Zhu <span id="S2.SS2.p3.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">39</a>]</cite> proposed SRR-FSD based on TFA <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>, which integrates semantic relations augmented by relational reasoning into the fine-tuning stage. Qiao <span id="S2.SS2.p3.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite> found that the entire FSOD model may suffer from being dominated by one of three components, including backbone, RPN, and RCNN, in the transfer learning-based detector, i.e., Faster R-CNN. They thus developed DeFRCN to alleviate the problem. Yang <span id="S2.SS2.p3.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib40" title="" class="ltx_ref">40</a>]</cite> proposed an efficient pre-train-transfer framework to enhance the adaptation speed which determines the efficiency of the few-shot transfer process.
On the other hand, the directly fine-tuning approaches may lead to catastrophic forgetting of the base class in the training novel stage. To avoid forgetting, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib41" title="" class="ltx_ref">41</a>]</cite> and <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite> proposed Retentive R-CNN by utilizing consistency loss and a constraint-based method by adapting continual learning, respectively.
Yet, these approaches seldom consider the localization of objects from local to global, i.e., neglect extended co-existing regions. Coupled with the limitation of the data-scarce scenario, some complex scenarios cannot be provided in the training stage, resulting in existing few-shot detectors incompletely predicting the box or even missing it in the test stage.</p>

<p id="S2.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">To capture the global features, some studies <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib42" title="" class="ltx_ref">42</a>, <a href="#bib.bib43" title="" class="ltx_ref">43</a>]</cite> straightforwardly or indirectly put forward the concept of extensible learning. For example, Aditya <span id="S2.SS3.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib43" title="" class="ltx_ref">43</a>]</cite> directly proposed scalable feature learning for nodes in graph networks, but it is difficult to extract features from the graph structure in the supervised tasks. On the contrary, the self-attention mechanism can capture all dependencies between image patches in a feature map to appropriately aggregate the input signal from the local to global in the supervised tasks. Inspired by this, some self-attention-based methods <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>, <a href="#bib.bib44" title="" class="ltx_ref">44</a>, <a href="#bib.bib45" title="" class="ltx_ref">45</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite> expand the receptive field to directly capture the complete regions of the object. Yet, these approaches rely on abundant annotated samples. To solve the problem, the self-attention mechanism has also made certain progress in FSOD tasks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>. For example, based on meta-learning, Han <span id="S2.SS3.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al</span>. proposed FCT that aligns the extracted features in all network layers between the support set and query set to improve their similarity. Although FCT allows the model to acquire many features, it still cannot infer the unseen regions from the existing feature. In view of this, we propose an ECEA module that not only allows the model to learn the relationships between co-existing regions but infer the global object from part regions of the object in FSOD.</p>

We also take Faster R-CNN as the basic architecture to demonstrate the performance of our proposed ECEA module, which assists the detector to extend the detection capability of features from local to global. As for a two-stage stacking framework, Faster R-CNN <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite> is composed of three independent functional modules which include backbone, RPN, and ROI. To be specific, the generalized features extracted by the backbone are respectively input into RPN used to generate class-independent proposals and ROI used to perform specific tasks related to class-related classification and localization.</p>

<p id="S3.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">To enable the model to infer the global object according to the local parts in data-scarce scenarios, we propose a transfer-learning-based method, i.e., the ECEA module. Specifically, we develop extensible attention which lets the current object region from the input feature map extend to several co-existing regions and the obtained regions continue to extend outward. Then, we combine the feature extractor and the proposed extensible attention in the ECEA module as shown in Fig. <a href="#S1.F2" title="Figure 2 ‣ I Introduction ‣ ECEA: Extensible Co-Existing Attention for Few-Shot Object Detection" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>(a). Following previous works <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>, we use ResNet101 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite> as the backbone (including five stages) for feature extraction. Experiments show that the combination of the last three stages with extensible attention can obtain the best performance in FSOD. Therefore, the output of the last three stages with the positional encoding is input into the proposed extensible attention that can learn the feature relationships in different feature scales to progressively discover the full object in various receptive fields. Furthermore, the outputs of attention layers in different scales are fused with each other through upsampling, which can help the high-level stage to correct the extensible unseen regions of former stages and the output of ECEA module to recover the high spatial resolution. Finally, we aggregate the fused stages to enrich the extensible feature information and promote the performance of the model in FSOD. The process of feature fusion can be given by</p>

<p id="S3.SS2.SSS2.p3.2" class="ltx_p">Increasing the extensible attention layer, the discriminant analysis of object features would be strengthened, which improve the robustness of object regression in the data-scarce scenario.
For example, Fig. <a href="#S3.F3" title="Figure 3 ‣ III-B Extensible Co-Existing Attention ‣ III Method ‣ ECEA: Extensible Co-Existing Attention for Few-Shot Object Detection" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a> shows the model learning performance on the support and query samples in different extensible attention layers and respectively lists the learning performance of the model at each layer, where the output of the former layer is the input of the latter layer. Although the input image only contains part of the object information, with the deepening of the layers, the extensible ability of the model is gradually stimulated to completely cover the localization of the query object.

<p id="S3.SS3.p1.11" class="ltx_p">Faster R-CNN is not directly designed for FSOD. Based on this fact, as shown in Fig. 2, we propose a novel architecture based on Faster R-CNN by ECEA module suitable for few-shot object location recognition. Specifically, the annotation-scarce sample input to the ECEA module generates a series of high-level feature maps. The output feature maps from the ECEA module with the extensible ability are parallelly provided in the next two modules, i.e., RPN and ROI. In addition, under the repeated learning of extensible attention, RPN can get rid of the constraint of anchor fixed size to generate sparse high-quality region proposals sets in the box regression task. Based on sharing extensible part feature vectors and RNP proposals, ROI fine-tunes the box boundaries to contain complete regions of the object. In order to ensure that the detection network will not be dominated by Backbone, RPN, and ROI, we also adopt the decoupled Faster R-CNN strategy <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite> to restrict the backward gradient from RPN and ROI to the backbone. Therefore, the loss function from the optimized FSOD architecture can be given by:</p>

<p id="S3.SS3.p2.1" class="ltx_p">To implement model optimization, the ECEA module needs to be trained in both the base and novel stages. To be specific, in the base stage, the model fully learns feature extension during sufficient samples to be equipped with the extensible ability which will directly transfer to the novel stage. When some unseen scenarios appear in the novel test sample, the ECEA module can determine whether the appeared regions co-exist with the current object according to extensible learning.</p>

As for PASCAL VOC, we combine VOC2007 and VOC2012 to train the proposed network, in which the combined dataset is split into three groups same as <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>. To be specific, each group in the dataset includes 15 base classes and 5 novel classes, where each novel class is randomly combined with 1, 2, 3, 5, and 10 shots for reporting accuracy. Furthermore, the VOC2007 test set is used for evaluation. With regard to COCO, 60 categories disjoint with VOC are marked as base classes, and meanwhile, the remaining 20 classes are used as novel classes. We then select 5,000 images from the val dataset for testing and the rest combined with the training set for training.

From the table, all evaluation results of ECEA outperform the classical methods in G-FSOD and FSOD protocols, respectively. In addition, ECEA at FSOD protocol achieves 10.4% and 10.6% improvement over the baseline of fine-tuning-based TFA <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite> in 10-shot and 30-shot settings, respectively.

In 10-shot setting, compared with the latest FSOD study <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite>, the performance of ECEA is enhanced by 1.2 and 2 points in both G-FSOD and FSOD protocols, respectively.

The results fully demonstrate that our proposed ECEA can effectively assist the few-shot model to extend global co-existing regions from the local part. From all comparison results, our method significantly improves the performance of the few-shot model in both FSOD and G-FSOD settings. In the FSOD protocol, our method is higher than existing FSOD methods in all indicators.

<div id="S4.SS3.SSS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS3.SSS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In the ECEA module, extensible attention can assist the few-shot detector to automatically capture co-existing regions in the feature map, while the residual module in ResNet101 can effectively solve the problem of gradient disappearance in deep networks to improve model accuracy. The appropriate combination of these two approaches in different feature scales can progressively discover the full object in various receptive fields and significantly enhance the generalization ability of the model. Therefore, we perform comprehensive ablation experiments on VOC-Split1 to explore the most reasonable combination of the different output stages of ResNet101 and extensible attention. Furthermore, we refer to the combination of a stage and extensible attention as a block in this paper. As for the training details, the number of extensible points is set to 4 and the number of multi-layers of extensible attention is set to 7. Notably, we remove the decoupling module to release a certain GPU memory to report the base results in the G-FSOD setting.</p>

<div id="S4.SS3.SSS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS3.SSS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Table <a href="#S4.T5" title="TABLE V ‣ IV-B3 Effectiveness of ECEA Module on Base Classes ‣ IV-B Comparison Results ‣ IV Experimental Results and Analysis ‣ ECEA: Extensible Co-Existing Attention for Few-Shot Object Detection" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">V</span></a> lists the experiment results for the three different blocks, where a block is the combination of a ResNet101 stage with extensible attention. As can be seen from the table, Block5 learns more high-level features to obtain the best scalability and accuracy in the single block output. We thus always consider Block5 to combine with other blocks. From the table, Block5 with Block3 and Block4 reach the best results. In view of this, we select the last three stages of ResNet101 combined with the extensible attention in the ECEA module.</p>

<p id="S4.SS3.SSS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In extensible attention, a certain sample location with increasing key points can extend more prominent regions, but the computational complexity also grows. To ensure that the performance of ECEA with the few attention calculations would not decline, we compare the results between a series of groups of extensible points on VOC-Split1. In this experiment, we take the results of 1-shot, 2-shot, and the average as our evaluation index. To be specific, Fig. <a href="#S4.F4" title="Figure 4 ‣ IV-B1 Results on PASCAL VOC ‣ IV-B Comparison Results ‣ IV Experimental Results and Analysis ‣ ECEA: Extensible Co-Existing Attention for Few-Shot Object Detection" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a> shows the results of 13 groups of extensible points. There are three groups of local maximum extensible points in the figure, which are 4, 30, and 50, respectively. The first point is also the absolute maximum point. On the other hand, as the number of points increases, a lot of computational complexity would be introduced, which consumes more training time than the former setting, especially in over 1000 points. According to the above analysis, we thus consider that a sample point with 4 prominent extensible regions is most suitable for the ECEA module. Meanwhile, the computational complexity of extensible attention can be expressed as <math id="S4.SS3.SSS2.p1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="O(4HWC)" display="inline"><semantics id="S4.SS3.SSS2.p1.1.m1.1a"><mrow id="S4.SS3.SSS2.p1.1.m1.1.1" xref="S4.SS3.SSS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml"><mi id="S4.SS3.SSS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.3" xref="S4.SS3.SSS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml">O</mi><mo lspace="0em" rspace="0em" id="S4.SS3.SSS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.2" xref="S4.SS3.SSS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml">​</mo><mrow id="S4.SS3.SSS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1" xref="S4.SS3.SSS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.cmml"><mo stretchy="false" id="S4.SS3.SSS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.2" xref="S4.SS3.SSS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.cmml">(</mo><mrow id="S4.SS3.SSS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1" xref="S4.SS3.SSS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.cmml"><mn id="S4.SS3.SSS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.2" xref="S4.SS3.SSS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.2.cmml">4</mn><mo lspace="0em" rspace="0em" id="S4.SS3.SSS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.1" xref="S4.SS3.SSS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.1.cmml">​</mo><mi id="S4.SS3.SSS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.3" xref="S4.SS3.SSS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.3.cmml">H</mi><mo lspace="0em" rspace="0em" id="S4.SS3.SSS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.1a" xref="S4.SS3.SSS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.1.cmml">​</mo><mi id="S4.SS3.SSS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.4" xref="S4.SS3.SSS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.4.cmml">W</mi><mo lspace="0em" rspace="0em" id="S4.SS3.SSS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.1b" xref="S4.SS3.SSS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.1.cmml">​</mo><mi id="S4.SS3.SSS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.5" xref="S4.SS3.SSS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.5.cmml">C</mi></mrow><mo stretchy="false" id="S4.SS3.SSS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.3" xref="S4.SS3.SSS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.cmml">)</mo></mrow></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S4.SS3.SSS2.p1.1.m1.1b"><apply id="S4.SS3.SSS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS3.SSS2.p1.1.m1.1.1"><times id="S4.SS3.SSS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S4.SS3.SSS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.2"></times><ci id="S4.SS3.SSS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S4.SS3.SSS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.3">𝑂</ci><apply id="S4.SS3.SSS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS3.SSS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1"><times id="S4.SS3.SSS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS3.SSS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.1"></times><cn type="integer" id="S4.SS3.SSS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S4.SS3.SSS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.2">4</cn><ci id="S4.SS3.SSS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S4.SS3.SSS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.3">𝐻</ci><ci id="S4.SS3.SSS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.4.cmml" xref="S4.SS3.SSS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.4">𝑊</ci><ci id="S4.SS3.SSS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.5.cmml" xref="S4.SS3.SSS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.5">𝐶</ci></apply></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S4.SS3.SSS2.p1.1.m1.1c">O(4HWC)</annotation></semantics></math>.</p>

<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we have investigated an FSOD method, namely the ECEA module, which alleviates the data scarcity problem for FSOD to detect unseen object parts. Specifically, we proposed the extensible attention mechanism which lets the model from a current region infer all co-existing regions of the common object. Furthermore, we combined the feature extractor with the extensible attention mechanism at different feature scales in the ECEA module, which progressively discovered the full object in various receptive fields. Based on the PASCAL VOC and COCO datasets, we have taken extensive comparison and ablation experiments to evaluate the effectiveness and expandability of our method, respectively. The experiment results show that the ECEA module could completely detect unseen object parts and achieved new states of the arts in FSOD.</p>
