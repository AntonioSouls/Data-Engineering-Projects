<p id="id2.id1" class="ltx_p">This paper presents a lightweight network for head pose estimation (HPE) task. While previous approaches rely on convolutional neural networks, the proposed network <span id="id2.id1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">LwPosr</span> uses mixture of depthwise separable convolutional (DSC) and transformer encoder layers which are structured in two streams and three stages to provide fine-grained regression for predicting head poses. The quantitative and qualitative demonstration is provided to show that the proposed network is able to learn head poses efficiently while using less parameter space. Extensive ablations are conducted using three open-source datasets namely 300W-LP, AFLW2000, and BIWI datasets. To our knowledge, (1) <span id="id2.id1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">LwPosr</span> is the lightest network proposed for estimating head poses compared to both keypoints-based and keypoints-free approaches; (2) it sets a benchmark for both overperforming the previous lightweight network on mean absolute error and on reducing number of parameters; (3) it is first of its kind to use mixture of DSCs and transformer encoders for HPE. This approach is suitable for mobile devices which require lightweight networks.</p>

<span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_section">1 </span>Introduction</h2>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Analysis of facial gestures and landmarks have been actively researched since past few decades <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>. Some of the sub-topics involving facial analysis are face recognition, face detection and alignment, head pose estimation (HPE), facial emotion recognition, etc. HPE is crucial for non-verbal communication (NVC) in helping blind people, advanced driver assistance systems, behaviour analysis, in-person attention modeling, human-computer interaction, virtual/augmented reality, etc.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Depth images are used in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>, <a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite> to predict head poses since estimating yaw, pitch, and roll angles are a 3D vision problem. Using depth images, it is possible to achieve high prediction performance but they require RGB-D cameras. Past works on HPE have also used facial landmark for predicting 3D vectors <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>. But it leads to expensive computation costs and larger models. Therefore, these techniques are not suitable to be utilized on platforms which require low computation power and have limited memory. This calls for designing lightweight networks as they are serviceable for employing them on mobile devices such as drones, movable robots, mobile phones, advanced driver assistance systems.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Using holistic approach of predicting 3D head pose from single image has shown to perform better than the keypoints-based methods <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite>. Keypoints-based techniques are required to have good detection accuracy of keypoints. Furthermore, it makes the network unnecessarily complex. Also, its performance depends on the standard of the 3D head model which is required for establishing correspondences with keypoints. It is common to jointly predict facial landmarks and head poses but the primary goal in these works is generally to predict the landmarks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>, <a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>, <a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite>. So, being the secondary task, predicted head poses are not very accurate. In this work, a complete end-to-end learning based network is designed for HPE keeping in mind to use less number of parameters and at the same time to have a good performance.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Transformers <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>]</cite> have recently become famous in computer vision problems considering their good performance for natural language processing applications. They have been used in image classification <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>, image enhancement <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib44" title="" class="ltx_ref">44</a>]</cite>, image segmentation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">38</a>]</cite>, and object detection <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>. They are being preferred for various different modalities. The positive point about their use is that they help in reducing the inductive biases that come into designing the networks. They are also shown to get an enormous parameter number reduction while maintaining the estimation performance <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>. Attention in the form of self-attention mechanism is the main building basis of transformers. It also makes it possible to learn the alignments and order which exist inside the data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>, <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>. Hence, it helps to remove the requirement for watchfully designing the inductive biases to a large extent. To our best knowledge, this is the first work using transformer encoders in a network with depthwise separable convolutions (DSCs) for designing a lightweight network for HPE.</p>

<div id="S2.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Head pose estimation can be solved in two ways. One way is to use the facial landmarks (or keypoints) along with a reference 3D head model to predict the head pose from these landmarks. The other way is to utilize the complete face appearance to predict the pose using either direct relation from image to pose or using a appearance face model.</p>

<p id="S2.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S2.SS1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Keypoints-Based Approaches:</span>
In these approaches, keypoints are estimated initially and then utilized for predicting the head pose. 3D vision techniques are used as in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite> where first 2D face keypoints are detected. Some techniques <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib42" title="" class="ltx_ref">42</a>, <a href="#bib.bib43" title="" class="ltx_ref">43</a>, <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite> sketch rough faces and then modify these faces incrementally to align them with the real faces using regression. Model-based techniques generate human face models using landmarks and generate correspondences on real faces using learned appearance models. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>, an optimization technique to regress 3DMM parameters is utilized and prediction of rotation matrix is performed using a network. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>, a heatmap-CNN is defined which refines the facial landmarks iteratively and HPE is a side product of the total task. Techniques employing deep learning to predict 3D face models using trained network perform better than the traditional approaches. These keypoint based techniques under-perform as compared to non-keypoints based approaches.</p>

<p id="S2.SS1.p3.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S2.SS1.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Non-keypoints-Based Approaches:</span>
Non-keypoints based methods have the benefit of not requiring the acquisition of the landmarks which makes the task less intensive. Different approaches have used different kind of modalities to solve HPE. Many recent approaches have employed a single RGB image for estimating the head poses <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>, <a href="#bib.bib46" title="" class="ltx_ref">46</a>, <a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>, <a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>, <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>, <a href="#bib.bib53" title="" class="ltx_ref">53</a>, <a href="#bib.bib50" title="" class="ltx_ref">50</a>]</cite>. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite>, a ResNet50 is used along with multi-loss technique where loss consists of binned pose classification and regression for all three angles separately. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib46" title="" class="ltx_ref">46</a>]</cite>, a stage-wise regression is performed using a CNN based network. A new feature aggregation approach with attention mechanism is used to combine features from each stage. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib53" title="" class="ltx_ref">53</a>]</cite>, multi-loss approach is used to work on full range of yaws. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib50" title="" class="ltx_ref">50</a>]</cite>, a feature decoupling model is used to learn discriminative feature for individual pose angle using a cross-category loss. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>, rotation matrix is used to represent three vectors for depicting the head pose. They used three sub-networks which are very similar to that used in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib46" title="" class="ltx_ref">46</a>]</cite> to estimate the three vectors, i.e., total nine values instead of three angles. In this paper, non-keypoints-based technique is used as it is shown to have several advantages over the keypoints-based techniques.</p>

In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">39</a>]</cite>, a new network based on a mixture of convolutions and vision transformer is designed to have the positives of both convolutions and transformer. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite> also, a mixture of CNN with a transformer is utilized for multi-instance pose estimation.

In a conventional convolution, filtering and combining of input to output features takes place in a single step. DSC breaks this single step into two individual layers, i.e., a layer for filtrating and a second layer for combining. This splitting step helps in considerably reducing the computation power required and further aids in reducing the model size.
The DSC is followed by a transformer encoder. The convolution layer helps in capturing the local and global dependencies, and transformer encoder aids in understanding the global information. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite> and <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib45" title="" class="ltx_ref">45</a>]</cite>, transformer encoder is used with convolutional based networks to understand the image-based features. Motivated by these works, in this paper, the output from convolutional layer is converted in the form of sequential features to use as an input to transformer encoder. The description of the functioning and decreased dimension of the transformer encoder is presented in section <a href="#S3.SS3" title="3.3 Transformer Encoder: ‣ 3 Method ‣ LwPosr: Lightweight Efficient Fine Grained Head Pose Estimation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3.3</span></a>.</p>

But the combination of these filtered output does not take place by the depthwise convolutional layer. Therefore, a pointwise convolutional layer is used to combine them. It linearly combines the output features from the depthwise convolutional layer.
Both the layers, i.e., depthwise and pointwise convolution form a DSC.

<p id="S3.SS3.p1.8" class="ltx_p">Each stage structure except the first one has a transformer encoder, i.e., second and third stage in both the streams. Transformer encoder follows a very similar structure as proposed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>]</cite>. To reform the output from the DSC, a reshaper is used. It converts the output features into a sequential form which can be used as an input to transformer encoder.

<div id="S6.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">This paper presented a novel architecture <em id="S6.p1.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">LwPosr</em> for head pose predictions. In contrast to previous work, this model is able to predict poses efficiently by taking a very small number of parameters and memory. A key insight is that transformer encoder helps in learning the global information. Using transformer encoder in combination with the depthwise separable convolutions gets the best of both entities and helps to learn spatial as well as global features. Furthermore, transformer encoders take less number of parameters, hence small network size. It is demonstrated that proposed model outperforms previous memory efficient approaches on 1) lowering mean absolute error and 2) decreasing the number of parameters. It is believed that in future crucial concepts of the presented work can be used in other domains and tasks that have a similar problem statement.</p>
