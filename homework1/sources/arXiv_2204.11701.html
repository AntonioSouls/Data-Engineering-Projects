<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we present Tac2Pose, an object-specific approach to tactile pose estimation from the first touch for known objects. Given the object geometry, we learn a tailored perception model in simulation that estimates a probability distribution over possible object poses given a tactile observation. To do so, we simulate the contact shapes that a dense set of object poses would produce on the sensor. Then, given a new contact shape obtained from the sensor, we match it against the pre-computed set using an object-specific embedding learned using contrastive learning. We obtain contact shapes from the sensor with an object-agnostic calibration step that maps RGB tactile observations to binary contact shapes. This mapping, which can be reused across object and sensor instances, is the only step trained with real sensor data.
This results in a perception model that localizes objects from the first real tactile observation.
Importantly, it produces pose distributions and can incorporate additional pose constraints coming from other perception systems, multiple contacts, or priors.
</p>
<p id="id2.id2" class="ltx_p">We provide quantitative results for 20 objects.
Tac2Pose provides high accuracy pose estimations from distinctive tactile observations while regressing meaningful pose distributions to account for those contact shapes that could result from different object poses.
We extend and test Tac2Pose in multi-contact scenarios where two tactile sensors are simultaneously in contact with the object, as during a grasp with a parallel jaw gripper.
We further show that when the output pose distribution is filtered with a prior on the object pose, Tac2Pose is often able to improve significantly on the prior. This suggests synergistic use of Tac2Pose with additional sensing modalities (e.g. vision) even in cases where the tactile observation from a grasp is not sufficiently discriminative. Given a coarse estimate of an object’s pose, even ambiguous contacts can be used to determine an object’s pose precisely.</p>
<p id="id3.id3" class="ltx_p">We also test Tac2Pose on object models reconstructed from a 3D scanner, to evaluate the robustness to uncertainty in the object model. We show that even in the presence of model uncertainty, Tac2Pose is able to achieve fine accuracy comparable to when the object model is the manufacturer’s CAD model. Finally, we demonstrate the advantages of Tac2Pose compared with three baseline methods for tactile pose estimation: directly regressing the object pose with a neural network, matching an observed contact to a set of possible contacts using a standard classification neural network, and direct pixel comparison of an observed contact with a set of possible contacts.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Robotics history sends a clear lesson: accurate and reliable perception is an enabler of progress in robotics.
From depth cameras to convolutional neural networks, we have seen how advances in perception foster the development of new techniques and applications.
For instance, the invention of high-resolution LIDAR fueled self-driving cars,
and the generalization capacity of deep neural networks has dominated progress in perception and grasp planning in warehouse automation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Zeng et al., <a href="#bib.bib48" title="" class="ltx_ref">2018</a>; Milan et al., <a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">2018</a>; Schwarz et al., <a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">2018</a>)</cite>.
The long term goal of our research is to understand the key role that tactile sensing plays in that progress.
In particular, we are interested in robotic manipulation applications, where occlusions challenge accurate object pose estimation, and where object dynamics are dominated by contact interactions.</p>

<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we propose Tac2Pose, a framework to estimate the pose of a touched object, as illustrated in Figure <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ Tac2Pose: Tactile Object Pose Estimation from the First Touch." class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>.
Given a 3D model of the object, Tac2Pose learns an object-specific perception model in simulation, tailored at estimating the pose of the object from one–or possibly multiple–tactile images.
As a result, the approach localizes the object from the first touch, i.e., without requiring any previous interaction.
The perception model is based on merging two key ideas:</p>

The comparison happens in an object-specific embedding for contact shapes learned in simulation using contrastive learning tools <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(He et al., <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>)</cite>.
This provides robustness and speed compared to other methods based on direct pixel comparisons.</p>
</div>
</li>
</ul>
<p id="S1.p2.2" class="ltx_p">Enabled by the discriminative power of tactile sensing, the proposed approach is motivated by scenarios where the main requirement is estimation accuracy and where object models will be available beforehand.
Many industrial scenarios fit this category.
We also consider cases where the object model is not known exactly, but reconstructed apriori with a 3D scanner.
This broadens the set of scenarios to which Tac2Pose can be applied.
Many previous solutions to tactile pose estimation require prior exploration of the object <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Li et al., <a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">2014</a>; Bauza et al., <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>)</cite>.
Acquiring this tactile experience can be expensive, and in many cases, unrealistic.
In this paper, instead, we learn the perception model directly from the object mesh model.
The results in Sec. <a href="#S4.SS2" title="4.2 Real pose estimation results ‣ 4 Results ‣ Tac2Pose: Tactile Object Pose Estimation from the First Touch." class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4.2</span></a> show that the model learned in simulation directly transfers to the real world.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">We attribute this to the object-specific nature of the learned model, the high resolution nature of the tactile sensors, and the contrastive-based perception framework. Tac2Pose uses an intermediate representation of the tactile image, a binary contact mask, which we are able to generate with high fidelity both in simulation and using the real sensor. Furthermore, because Tac2Pose matches observed contact shapes to a discrete set of simulated contacts, the match doesn’t need to be perfect - just better than the other possible options - for the localization to be accurate.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Also key to the approach is that, by simulating a dense set of tactile imprints, the algorithm can reason over pose distributions, not only the best estimate.
The learned embedding allows us to efficiently compute the likelihood of each contact shape in the simulated dense set to match with the predicted contact shape from the tactile sensor. Predicting distributions is key given that tactile sensing provides local observations, which often do not discriminate pose globally (see, for example, the first contact in Figure <a href="#S4.F7.sf1" title="In Figure 7 ‣ 4.2 Real pose estimation results ‣ 4 Results ‣ Tac2Pose: Tactile Object Pose Estimation from the First Touch." class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">7(a)</span></a>).</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Finally, by maintaining probability distributions in pose space, we can incorporate extra constraints over the likelihood of each pose.
We illustrate it in the case of multi-contact, where information from multiple tactile observations must be combined simultaneously, and in the case of filtering the distribution with a prior estimate of the object pose.
In practice, this prior estimate could come from previous tactile observations, kinematics, or other perception systems (e.g., vision).</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">We evaluate the performance of Tac2Pose on real datasets collected for 20 different real objects of varying size and complexity in Section <a href="#S4.SS2" title="4.2 Real pose estimation results ‣ 4 Results ‣ Tac2Pose: Tactile Object Pose Estimation from the First Touch." class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4.2</span></a>.

First we provide results for 20 different objects (instead of 4) and analyze Tac2Pose in the case of a single contact, as well as when localizing objects using the two contacts from a parallel-jaw grasp, or when there is a prior pose distribution (that could come from vision). Moreover, we also greatly expand the number of possible contacts that we test per object, and the generality of grids that we match against, which simulates more closely a scenario with truly no prior information. This work also includes comparisons against sensible baselines, uses a better sensor and novel algorithm for extracting contact masks. Finally, we provide extensive details over the existence of non-unique contacts, the importance of 3D models (by analyzing the effect of using reconstructed rather than perfect object models), and quality of the resulting pose distributions, which further exposes the complexity of solving tactile localization.</p>

Among the solutions that combine vision and tactile, most rely on tactile sensors as binary contact detectors whose main purpose is to refine the predictions from vision <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Bimbo et al., <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">2015</a>; Allen et al., <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">1999</a>; Ilonen et al., <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">2014</a>; Falco et al., <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">2017</a>; Yu &amp; Rodriguez, <a href="#bib.bib47" title="" class="ltx_ref">2018</a>)</cite>.</p>

<p id="S2.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Other works, more in line with Tac2Pose, have focused on using high-resolution tactile sensors as the main sensing source for object localization.
Initial works in this direction
used image-based tactile sensors to recover the contact shape of an object and then use it to filter the object pose <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Platt et al., <a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">2011</a>; Pezzementi et al., <a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">2011</a>; Luo, Mou, Althoefer &amp; Liu, <a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">2017</a>)</cite>.
However, these approaches only provide results on planar objects and require previous tactile exploration.
There has also been some recent work on highly deformable tactile sensors for object localization <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Kuppuswamy et al., <a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>)</cite>.
These sensors are large enough to fully cover the touched objects, which eases localization.</p>

Their tracker is fused with vision to deal with the uncertainty that arises from the locality of tactile sensing.
In previous work <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Bauza et al., <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>)</cite>, we proposed to extract local contact shapes from the sensors and match them to the tactile map of the objects to do object pose estimation.

Their tactile observation model is trained to predict the relative pose of the object between a pair of non-sequential tactile images. This approach is designed to track the drift of an object from an initial well-known pose.
Similarly, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Sodhi et al.

The tactile observation model maps from tactile images to surface normals using an image-to-image translation network, and uses ICP to determine the relative pose between 3D contact geometry in a contact sequence. This approach is designed to track the drift of object from an initial well-known pose, where the object itself is arbitrary and unknown.

Because this intermediate representation (pose of the contact line between the object and the cavity during an insertion attempt) can be simulated easily, the insertion policy can be trained entirely in simulation. Both this work and ours demonstrate the value of relying on geometric intermediate representations of contact shapes to allow high fidelity transfer of models trained on simulated data to real robotic systems.</p>

 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Labbé et al.

(<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">2018</a>)</cite> to estimate the pose of multiple known objects from a sequence of images from multiple, unknown, viewpoints. The approach consists of predicting object poses relative to the camera within single views, then robustly matching objects and poses between views, before performing a scene-level refinement of both object and camera pose. Although this method does not reason explicitly over pose distributions for a single-view estimate of pose, it is able to handle occlusions and inaccurate single estimates by combining information from multiple viewpoints.</p>

In an object-specific embedding, we match a dense set of simulated <span id="S3.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">contact shapes</span> against the estimated contact shape from a real tactile observation. A contact shape is a binary mask over contact regions on the tactile sensor.
This results in a probability distribution over contact poses that can be later refined using other pose constraints. For example, we can combine information from the two contact shapes and the gripper opening obtained by grasping an object with a parallel jaw gripper.</p>

<p id="S3.p3.1" class="ltx_p">The next steps of Tac2Pose exploit the object model to estimate the contact pose, and are learned in simulation without using any real tactile observations.
First, we render the contact shape for a given object pose, using the object model (Section <a href="#S3.SS2" title="3.2 Contact shape rendering in simulation ‣ 3 Method ‣ Tac2Pose: Tactile Object Pose Estimation from the First Touch." class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3.2</span></a>).

Next, we use geometric contact rendering to generate a dense set of object poses and their respective contact shapes, and use contrastive learning to learn an embedding to match contact shapes depending on the closeness of their object poses (Section <a href="#S3.SS3" title="3.3 Global tactile pose estimation ‣ 3 Method ‣ Tac2Pose: Tactile Object Pose Estimation from the First Touch." class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3.3</span></a>).

Finally, because our perception model outputs distributions over contact poses, is not restricted to single tactile observations. The distribution can be filtered or combined with other information coming from multi-contact scenarios, other sensing modalities, or additional pose constraints (Section <a href="#S3.SS4" title="3.4 Multi-contact pose estimation ‣ 3 Method ‣ Tac2Pose: Tactile Object Pose Estimation from the First Touch." class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3.4</span></a>).</p>

We train pix2pix using pairs of real RGB tactile images and their corresponding contact shapes.

Note that the map between RGB tactile images and contact shapes is independent of the object, and therefore we only need to gather labelled data once. Empirically, we found that a model trained on images from a single GelSlim sensor generalizes well across multiple instances of GelSlim sensors.</p>

<p id="S3.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Once we know how to compute contact shapes both in simulation and from real tactile imprints, we reduce the problem of object pose estimation to finding what contact poses are more likely to produce a given contact shape.
We solve this problem by first discretizing the space of possible contact poses as a parametrized grid, and then learning a similarity function that compares contact shapes.</p>

 Using the 3D model of an object, we discretize the space of object poses in a multidimensional grid.
Building a grid in the space of poses is a well-studied problem <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Yershova et al., <a href="#bib.bib46" title="" class="ltx_ref">2010</a>; Roşca et al., <a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">2014</a>)</cite> that makes finding nearest neighbors trivial.
It also allows each point on the grid to be seen as the representative of a volumetric part of the space which helps to reason over distributions.
We prune the grid by only keeping object poses that result in contact, and then pair each of them with their respective contact shape.
Since we only consider poses that result in contact, this reduces the space of 6D poses to a 5D manifold.
Using a grid, a discrete structured set of poses, allows us to easily account for object symmetries which can significantly reduce the grid size.

<div id="S3.SS3.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS3.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Our grids cover regions of the object which correspond to feasible grasp locations from the set of stable resting poses of the object on a surface.
In particular, we include faces that correspond to feasible <span id="S3.SS3.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">grasp approach directions</span>, where the grasp approach direction specifies the axis of the grasp relative to the object.
For some objects, we also include additional grasp approach directions that have interesting tactile features.
For each grasp approach direction, We compute a dense set of contacts with 2.5mm translational resolution, and 6 degrees of rotational resolution around the axis of the grasp.
As a result, the grid spans four coordinates (grasp approach direction, x, y, <math id="S3.SS3.p3.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\theta" display="inline"><semantics id="S3.SS3.p3.1.m1.1a"><mi id="S3.SS3.p3.1.m1.1.1" xref="S3.SS3.p3.1.m1.1.1.cmml">θ</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S3.SS3.p3.1.m1.1b"><ci id="S3.SS3.p3.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS3.p3.1.m1.1.1">𝜃</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S3.SS3.p3.1.m1.1c">\theta</annotation></semantics></math>) and a contact pose will be no more than 1.25mm from an element of the grid, and often closer.
A visualization of the grid dimensions can be seen in Figure <a href="#S3.F2" title="Figure 2 ‣ 3.3 Global tactile pose estimation ‣ 3 Method ‣ Tac2Pose: Tactile Object Pose Estimation from the First Touch." class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>.
The number of elements in each grid varies between 3.8K and 181.3K, depending on the object size, shape, and number of grasp approach directions. We render each triplet of elements (two contacts, and the gripper opening) at 15 Hz, which can be parallelized. When grids are rendered serially, generating them takes from several minutes to many hours, depending on the grid size.</p>

Given a new contact shape, we compare it to all pre-computed contact shapes in the grid to find what poses are more likely to produce it.
To that aim, we modify Momentum Contrast (MoCo) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(He et al., <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>)</cite>, a widely-used algorithm in contrastive learning, to encode contact shapes into a low dimensional embedding based on the distance between contact poses.</p>

<p id="S3.SS3.p5.1" class="ltx_p">MoCo is able to learn unsupervised embeddings by building ”a dynamic dictionary with a queue and a moving-averaged encoder”.
Instead, Tac2Pose is supervised and the elements in the queue are fixed and assigned to each of the poses in the object’s grid. Given a new contact shape, our model learns to predict the likelihood that each pose in the grid has produced the given shape. This likelihood is computed by taking the softmax over the distances between the embedding of the new contact shape and the embeddings saved in the queue, which correspond to the embeddings of each contact shape in the grid. Compared to the original MoCo, Tac2Pose is supervised because during training, given a new contact shape, we can compute which element in the queue is closest to it.</p>

<div id="S3.SS3.p6" class="ltx_para">

The loss function is the categorical cross-entropy loss which allows us to ensure that the output of the softmax is a well-defined probability distribution.
The training data comes from selecting a random contact pose and finding its closest element in the dense grid.
Then, we use as desired probabilities a vector of all zeros except for the closest element which gets assigned to probability one (see Figure <a href="#S3.F3" title="Figure 3 ‣ 3.3 Global tactile pose estimation ‣ 3 Method ‣ Tac2Pose: Tactile Object Pose Estimation from the First Touch." class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a>).

To run Tac2Pose in real-time, we first encode the given contact shape and then compare it to all pre-computed encodings from the grid, which requires a single matrix-vector multiplication. Finally, we perform a softmax over the resulting vector of distances to obtain a probability distribution over the contact poses in the grid. We take the best match to be the contact pose with the highest probability, after (if applicable) incorporating additional pose constraints.</p>

As a result, the computational cost of considering multiple contacts scales linearly with the number of sensors. In this paper, we consider the case of grasping with a parallel jaw gripper. We include information from two tactile images and the opening of the gripper during the grasp. We also consider the case of filtering the parallel jaw grasp distribution with a prior on the object pose.</p>

To that aim, we design a system that collects tactile observations on accurately-controlled poses.
Below we describe the tactile sensor, the robot platform, and the objects used to perform the experiments.</p>

We consider the tactile sensor GelSlim 3.0  <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Taylor et al., <a href="#bib.bib43" title="" class="ltx_ref">2021</a>)</cite> which provides high-resolution tactile readings in the form of RGB images.
The sensor consists of a membrane that deforms when contacted and a camera that records the deformation.
The sensor publishes tactile observations through ROS as 470x470 compressed images at a frequency of 90Hz (see top left portion of Figure <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ Tac2Pose: Tactile Object Pose Estimation from the First Touch." class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>).</p>

We collect labelled datasets of tactile observations of grasps on 20 objects mounted in known positions and orientations in the world. Each dataset contains pairs of RGB tactile images, and the corresponding ground-truth object pose relative to the gripper.
The robotic system we use to collect the labelled datasets consists of a dual arm ABB Yumi with two WSG-32 grippers and GelSlim 3.0 tactile sensing fingers. We provide further details on the collection of labelled real data in Section <a href="#A2" title="Appendix B Collecting ground-truth data for real objects ‣ Tac2Pose: Tactile Object Pose Estimation from the First Touch." class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">B</span></a> of the Appendix.</p>

<p id="S4.SS1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">We collect labelled observations of feasible grasps on each object. We compute the contacts in each dataset by considering the <span id="S4.SS1.p4.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">stable poses</span> of each object. Stable poses are the poses that an object is most likely to fall in when dropped onto a table. We then determine a set of feasible grasp approach directions for each stable pose. We define the grasp approach direction as the axis of the grasp during a parallel jaw grasp (Figure <a href="#S3.F2" title="Figure 2 ‣ 3.3 Global tactile pose estimation ‣ 3 Method ‣ Tac2Pose: Tactile Object Pose Estimation from the First Touch." class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>). For some objects, we also include additional grasp approach directions that have interesting tactile features.
For each grasp approach direction, we collect a set of equispaced real observations, that correspond to a given grasp approach direction at various x,y locations relative to the object. In total, these observations correspond to the set of contacts that we are likely to encounter when picking up each object from a table.</p>

Finally, the example with 0.84 normalized error depicts a non-unique contact shape, i.e., the two object poses result in very similar contact shapes at the center that are not possible to distinguish without additional information.

We note that Tac2Pose , even for large grids (100K elements), can easily run at 50Hz allowing real-time estimation of pose distributions.
For each object, we evaluate Tac2Pose on 90 to 400 (varies depending on object size and number of grasp approach directions) pairs of real tactile images and object poses per object using the approach described in <a href="#S4.SS1" title="4.1 Real data collection ‣ 4 Results ‣ Tac2Pose: Tactile Object Pose Estimation from the First Touch." class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4.1</span></a>.</p>

This distance is sometimes called ADD (average 3D distance) but, for simplicity, we just refer to it as the pose error.
To compare errors across shapes and object sizes, we also compute the <span id="S4.SS2.p2.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">normalized pose error</span> which divides the original pose error by the average error obtained from predicting a random contact pose.

The estimate also factors in the opening of the gripper during the grasp by computing the joint probability distribution of each object pose given both the two contacts and the gripper opening. In practice, this corresponds to multiplying the pose distribution obtained from the two contacts with a normal distribution centered around the gripper opening that each object pose would produce. The standard deviation of the normal distribution is 3mm which accounts for the expected error between the actual opening and the one reported by the gripper.</p>

Each violin plot contains three distributions. At left, the single contact error distribution is visualized in <span id="S4.F5.13.2.1" class="ltx_text" style="color:#00FF00;">green</span>. At right, the parallel jaw contact distribution is visualized in <span id="S4.F5.13.2.2" class="ltx_text" style="color:#0000FF;">blue</span>, while the parallel jaw distribution filtered with a 10mm prior is overlaid in transparent <span id="S4.F5.13.2.3" class="ltx_text" style="color:#800080;">purple</span>. The median closest grid error is visualized as a <span id="S4.F5.13.2.4" class="ltx_text" style="color:#FF0000;">red</span> line. This corresponds to the best possible median performance. The median random error corresponds to a normalized pose error of 1.
To the left and right of each violin plot, we show the localization errors for a sample grasp on each object. In the <span id="S4.F5.13.2.5" class="ltx_text" style="color:#00FF00;">green</span> boxes, the true object pose (grey mesh) is visualized with the best match when using a single contact (<span id="S4.F5.13.2.6" class="ltx_text" style="color:#00FF00;">green</span> pointcloud). The <span id="S4.F5.13.2.7" class="ltx_text" style="color:#0000FF;">blue</span> boxes and <span id="S4.F5.13.2.8" class="ltx_text" style="color:#800080;">purple</span> box show the same true object pose (grey mesh) with the best match when using parallel jaw contacts (<span id="S4.F5.13.2.9" class="ltx_text" style="color:#0000FF;">blue</span> pointcloud), and parallel jaw contacts + a 10mm pose prior (<span id="S4.F5.13.2.10" class="ltx_text" style="color:#800080;">purple</span> pointcloud), respectively.
A single contact is enough to, on average, localize snap ring accurately using Tac2Pose (top row).
Parallel jaw contacts are enough to localize long grease and hydraulic accurately (second and third rows), even though a single contact is not.
Parallel jaw contacts and a coarse (10mm) pose prior are enough to localize cotter accurately (bottom row), even though single contact and parallel jaw contact information are not enough.</span></figcaption>

Consider the error distribution for snap ring, visualized in top row of Figure <a href="#S4.F5" title="Figure 5 ‣ 4.2 Real pose estimation results ‣ 4 Results ‣ Tac2Pose: Tactile Object Pose Estimation from the First Touch." class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5</span></a> as an example.
Even with a single contact (<span id="S4.SS2.p7.1.1" class="ltx_text" style="color:#00FF00;">green</span> distribution), the error distribution has a clear primary mode which is centered near the closest error from the grid (<span id="S4.SS2.p7.1.2" class="ltx_text" style="color:#FF0000;">red</span> line).
When incorporating additional constraints from a parallel jaw grasp, the distribution (<span id="S4.SS2.p7.1.3" class="ltx_text" style="color:#0000FF;">blue</span>) tightens around the closest error from the grid (<span id="S4.SS2.p7.1.4" class="ltx_text" style="color:#FF0000;">red</span> line), and secondary, higher error modes disappear.
The median normalized error is approximately 0.10 for both the single contact and parallel jaw contact cases (Table <a href="#S4.T1" title="Table 1 ‣ 4.2 Real pose estimation results ‣ 4 Results ‣ Tac2Pose: Tactile Object Pose Estimation from the First Touch." class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>).

<p id="S4.SS2.p10.1" class="ltx_p">The objects that perform significantly better with parallel jaw contacts compared with a single contact tend to be larger. Contacts with the object may appear as large, featureless patches from the local perspective of the tactile sensor. In general, large, flat contacts are more challenging to reconstruct from tactile images because they do not deform the gel membrane of the tactile sensor as much. Including the constraints of a second contact and the gripper opening provides higher robustness to noisy contact reconstructions.
Furthermore, objects that vary significantly in width depending on where they are grasped benefit from parallel jaw contacts. In these cases, the additional constraint of the gripper opening during grasp can disambiguate between otherwise non-unique contacts. Recall that a contact is non-unique if its look similar to contacts where the object is in a different pose. In these cases, the contact is not a unique indicator of the object pose.</p>

The medians of the error distributions for the single contact and parallel cases are significantly different; with a single contact, the median pose error is 26.6mm (0.76 normalized error) while with parallel jaw contacts, the median pose error is 3.3mm (0.10 normalized error). The random error, in comparison, is 35.2mm. With a single contact, Tac2Pose only performs about 1.3 times better than random. When including parallel jaw contacts, however, Tac2Pose is more 10 times better than random.

Pose priors, in practice, can be obtained using additional sensing modalities (e.g. vision), kinematics, or previous estimates of the object’s pose.
Because tactile sensing is inherently local, an object can have non-unique contacts which won’t be possible to fully disambiguate even with parallel jaw contacts. In such cases, a prior on the object’s pose can help resolve these ambiguities.
To test the effect of a prior on Tac2Pose , we take the prediction distribution over possible object poses, and filter any pose that is more than a given distance from ground truth. Note that this implementation of a pose prior requires knowledge of the ground truth object pose, but it is a useful proxy for cases in which the object pose is known roughly, but not accurately.
We evaluate localization accuracy for prior distances of 10mm and 5mm. Results for both prior distances for each of the 20 objects are listed in Table <a href="#S4.T1" title="Table 1 ‣ 4.2 Real pose estimation results ‣ 4 Results ‣ Tac2Pose: Tactile Object Pose Estimation from the First Touch." class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>.</p>

An object with discrete non-uniqueness has features that are unique (i.e. create discriminate tactile imprints) relative to most other possible contacts on the object, with a discrete number of exceptions. This type of discrete non-uniqueness can be an inherent feature of the object, or an artifact of noisy and incomplete contact shapes.
Because there is a discrete number of possible object poses that are likely to produce such a contact shape, we expect the distribution over object poses to have a discrete number of modes where the majority of probability mass is concentrated.
In these cases, incorporating a pose prior can truncate the distribution in such a way that only one of the modes is left. In other words, because there is a discrete number of possible poses that are likely to produce a given contact, if we eliminate the higher error options using a pose prior, we are likely to get a near perfect match. Therefore, for some objects, even a coarse prior on the object pose results in precise localization when combined with tactile information.</p>

For the remainder of this section, we consider just the case of a 10mm pose prior. For 12 of the 20 objects we evaluate, using Tac2Pose on top of a 10mm pose prior results in performance more than twice as good as selecting a pose at random from the filtered distribution. For 5 of the 12 objects, incorporating a pose prior plays an important role in driving down the localization error. With just parallel jaw contact information, the median localization error for these 5 objects is not significantly better than selecting a pose at random from the grid (where here we take <span id="S4.SS2.p19.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">significantly better</span> to be more than twice as good as random). However, after filtering the distribution with a 10mm prior on the object pose, Tac2Pose selects the best pose with more than twice as much accuracy as selecting a pose at random from the filtered distribution.

Its error distributions have a discrete number of modes (three) where the majority of probability mass is concentrated.
Note that the symmetry of cotter is such that parallel jaw contacts do not provide much new information relative to a single contact, so the distributions of error for a single contact and parallel jaw contacts are very similar. The median error is 19.0mm (0.49 normalized error) when using a single contact, and 19.6mm (0.51 normalized error) when using parallel jaw contacts.
Incorporation of a 10mm prior on the object pose eliminates the two higher error modes, and shifts the median of the distribution toward the closest error. The median error becomes 2.9mm (0.38 normalized error), which is nearly seven times lower than using parallel jaw contact information alone.

Many of the contact poses along the length of the object result in the same information, and thus on average the match is chosen essentially at random from a large set of possible contacts. Note that this is not a limitation of Tac2Pose for tactile localization, but rather results from the object geometry and the local nature of tactile feedback; most contacts on long pencil are not sufficient to uniquely determine the object pose.</p>

<div id="S4.SS2.p25" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS2.p25.1" class="ltx_p">Even for objects with a large amount of non-uniqueness on average, there can be regions of the object which create distinctive and unique tactile imprints. Contacts near either end of long pencil, for example, are easier to localize accurately. Grasping on these regions leads to better localization. Depending on the downstream application, it might be beneficial to plan for grasps on an object that are expected to produce more unique tactile imprints, and thus lower localization errors. The existence of good grasps is something we can detect and exploit to avoid large regions of non-uniqueness, and achieve low localization errors.
The distribution over contact poses for selected contacts on unique and non-unique regions of long pencil is shown in Figure <a href="#S4.F7.sf1" title="In Figure 7 ‣ 4.2 Real pose estimation results ‣ 4 Results ‣ Tac2Pose: Tactile Object Pose Estimation from the First Touch." class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">7(a)</span></a>. The top row of the figure shows three possible grasps on the object. The bottom row shows the output of Tac2Pose - a distribution over possible contact poses. Each dot overlaid on long pencil represents a possible grasp location, and the color represents the likelihood that a given grasp generated the input tactile observation. The <span id="S4.SS2.p25.1.1" class="ltx_text" style="color:#00FF00;">green</span> dots are grasps with highest likelihood, while the <span id="S4.SS2.p25.1.2" class="ltx_text" style="color:#0000FF;">blue</span> dots are grasps with lowest likelihood. The black dot represents the true grasp location. Note that for ease of visualization, we show only points that represent center locations of the grasp when long pencil is oriented horizontally. This is a small subset (935) of the total number of contacts (65k) Tac2Pose reasons over.
For contacts near the middle of the object (left of Figure <a href="#S4.F7.sf1" title="In Figure 7 ‣ 4.2 Real pose estimation results ‣ 4 Results ‣ Tac2Pose: Tactile Object Pose Estimation from the First Touch." class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">7(a)</span></a>, for example), many grasps along the length of the object have high probability (<span id="S4.SS2.p25.1.3" class="ltx_text" style="color:#00FF00;">green</span> dots). For instance, the left contact in Figure <a href="#S4.F7.sf1" title="In Figure 7 ‣ 4.2 Real pose estimation results ‣ 4 Results ‣ Tac2Pose: Tactile Object Pose Estimation from the First Touch." class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">7(a)</span></a> on its own is not enough to uniquely determine the object pose. In fact, the pose with the highest likelihood results in 77.9mm (0.99 normalized) error for this case. This aligns with our intuitive understanding that the best match is chosen essentially at random from a large set of likely contacts (<span id="S4.SS2.p25.1.4" class="ltx_text" style="color:#00FF00;">green</span> dots) along the middle of the object. Cases like this highlight the importance of outputting meaningful distributions over possible contact poses; the true contact pose has high likelihood, so Tac2Pose could be used in combination with information from other sensing modalities, kinematics, or previous tactile estimates to converge on a unique estimate of the true pose.</p>

<div id="S4.SS2.p26" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS2.p26.1" class="ltx_p">For contacts near the tips of the pencil (center and right of Figure <a href="#S4.F7.sf1" title="In Figure 7 ‣ 4.2 Real pose estimation results ‣ 4 Results ‣ Tac2Pose: Tactile Object Pose Estimation from the First Touch." class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">7(a)</span></a>, for example), only grasps immediately surrounding the correct tip have high probability. The cases illustrated result in 6mm (0.09 normalized) for the center contact, and 7mm (0.09 normalized) for the right.</p>
</div>
<div id="S4.SS2.p27" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS2.p27.1" class="ltx_p">In Figure <a href="#S4.F7.sf2" title="In Figure 7 ‣ 4.2 Real pose estimation results ‣ 4 Results ‣ Tac2Pose: Tactile Object Pose Estimation from the First Touch." class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">7(b)</span></a>, we show distributions over contact poses for simulated versions of the same three contacts on long pencil. The output distributions when using simulated contacts are qualitatively similar as when using real contacts. Simulated contact shapes can therefore be used to detect regions of non-uniqueness before ever encountering the object. This feature could be used in a grasp planning framework to avoid regions of non-unique contacts and promote accurate, unique pose estimation from a single grasp.</p>

The intuition for this decision is the following: when the object model is known, the gripper opening is a reliable signal of object pose. Therefore, we only want to assign high likelihood to those contact poses that match the observed gripper opening closely. When the object model is reconstructed with a scanner, we cannot be as confident that the gripper opening we measure corresponds closely to the opening of the true nearest contact pose in the grid. This is because the gripper opening computed using the scanned model will be noisy. Therefore, we may want to assign high likelihood to a contact pose, even if the observed gripper opening does not match the opening of the contact pose as closely.</p>

Although globally the geometry of the object looks similar between the scanned and manufacturer’s CAD models, there are clear differences at the local level. This ablation of Tac2Pose allows us to evaluate whether we are still able to achieve significant pose refinement, even when the local geometries are noisy.</p>

<p id="S4.SS3.p6.1" class="ltx_p">We find that the error is comparable to that when using a manufacturer’s CAD model for all 5 objects. The normalized error is between 1.01 times (long grease) and 1.33 times (cotter) higher when using a scanned model compared with the manufacturer’s CAD model. Cotter is most impacted by using a scanned object model because the contact non-uniqueness becomes less discrete. When the object model is known exactly, many of the contacts look unique with a discrete number of exceptions. Therefore, even a coarse prior on the object pose leads to precise localization. When the object model is noisy, the discrete nature of the non-uniqueness is impacted for a fraction of the contacts, and the median localization error increases.</p>

<div id="S4.SS3.p7" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS3.p7.1" class="ltx_p">For snap ring, hanger, long grease, and cotter Tac2Pose is able to improve on the 10mm prior by a significant amount. For the first three objects, including parallel jaw information on top of the 10mm prior results in localization errors twice as low as selecting a pose at random from the filtered distribution (in Table <a href="#S4.T2" title="Table 2 ‣ 4.3 Comparison with Scanned Object Models ‣ 4 Results ‣ Tac2Pose: Tactile Object Pose Estimation from the First Touch." class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>, the normalized pose errors for the scanned objects are less than 0.5). For cotter, the localization error is nearly twice as low as selecting a pose at random from the filtered distirbution (in Table <a href="#S4.T2" title="Table 2 ‣ 4.3 Comparison with Scanned Object Models ‣ 4 Results ‣ Tac2Pose: Tactile Object Pose Estimation from the First Touch." class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>, the normalized pose error is 0.51). For these four objects, Tac2Pose is able to refine the object pose within a small amount of error, even when local geometry is noisy.
For big head, the amount of error is comparable (1.22 times higher) to that when using a manufacturer’s CAD model. Because big head has a symmetry-breaking feature around its principle axis, many contacts are continuously non-unique, and therefore the localization error does not improve much when incorporating a coarse prior, even when the object model is known.</p>

We train a convolutional neural network (CNN) based on ResNet-50 to predict a distribution over the grid elements from a given contact mask. Recall that in Tac2Pose, the neural network is an encoder that maps contact shapes to vectors and we obtain a distribution over object poses by comparing the encoding from an observed contact shape to all the encodings from the contact shapes in the grid. In contrast, the neural network in the classification baseline learns to predict the distributions over object poses directly. We train this baseline by using the same data generation as in Tac2Pose. The inputs are simulated contacts that we obtained from slightly perturbing a pose from the grid and rendering its corresponding contact. For each of these new contacts, we compute its closest grid element and use as training label a vector with length equal to the number of elements as the grid, where all its values are zero except the entry corresponding to the index of the closest element, which has value one. This vector represents a probability distribution that measures the likelihood of each element of the grid to be the closest to the new contact. The loss function is the cross-entropy loss between the predicted likelihood and the classification label. At test time, from an observed tactile image in the form of a contact mask we obtain a distribution over grid elements.</p>

The training data consists of contact shapes as inputs, and the contact poses that generated such contacts as labels. Each label is a pose represented by three translational elements, and six rotational elements that can be mapped into a rotation matrix. In comparison with quaternions, our 6D representation of rotations is continuous (meaning that similar orientations are close together in 6D representation), and therefore better suited to regression. We construct the last column of the rotation matrix from the 6D representation by applying Gram-Schmidt as a post-process on the first two columns, and taking the third column as the cross product of the first two <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Zhou et al., <a href="#bib.bib49" title="" class="ltx_ref">2018</a>)</cite>. The loss function is the mean squared error between the output and true nine-element pose. This method for pose prediction does not rely on matching to elements on the grid, but rather predicts the pose of the object directly using supervised regression.</p>

For example, comparing mini one face and one face can indicate the sensitivity of each method to grid size and resolution. Comparing one face and the original grid (called full from here on out), which have the same resolution but cover different faces, provides insight into how each method handles complexity in the form of 3D rotations. Mini one face and bigger mini one face have the same translational resolution, but bigger mini one face varies the angle in the plane of the grasp.

The normalized error is 0.12, compared with 0.08 for the single contact case of Tac2Pose. This indicates that although classification could be effective for very small grid sizes, the grids quickly become too large. Even with bigger mini one face, which contains 794 transformations, classification has a normalized error of 0.6, making it more than six times worse than Tac2Pose (single contact), which has 0.09 normalized error.</p>
</div>
<div id="S4.SS4.p11" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS4.p11.1" class="ltx_p">The classification baseline struggles with larger grid sizes because it needs to provide a classification over all elements in the grid, which often contains thousands of elements (the full grid for hanger, for example, has more than 90k contact poses).
In comparison with the classification baseline, Tac2Pose scales better to large grid sizes because it learns to generate an embedding space based on the distance between contact poses. The encoder in Tac2Pose learns to push distant contacts away in embedding space, and therefore when comparing a new encoding to all the encodings in the grid, this direct comparison scales better than classification when the set of contacts in the grid is large. Instead, in classification the learned NN needs to encapsulate all the information relevant about all poses solely in the NN weights. Another way to think about the difference is to consider Tac2Pose as describing each contact in the grid with 1000 parameters (the encoder), whereas with classification, each contact in the grid is described by a single parameter (0 or 1).</p>

For one face (OF in Figure <a href="#S4.F8.sf1" title="In Figure 8 ‣ 4.4 Comparison with Baselines ‣ 4 Results ‣ Tac2Pose: Tactile Object Pose Estimation from the First Touch." class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">8(a)</span></a>), which covers one object face with the same translational and rotational resolution as the full grid, the normalized pose error using pose is 0.26, compared with 0.04 for the single contact version of Tac2Pose. For the full grid, the normalized error for pose and the single contact version of Tac2Pose is 0.18 and 0.08, respectively. In the absence of contact shape noise (simulated contacts), Tac2Pose is about 2.3 times better on the full grid.
Recall that the pose baseline does not match observed contacts to contact poses on the grid, but instead regresses the corresponding contact pose directly.
In pose, the learned NN needs to encapsulate all information relevant about all poses solely in the NN weights, as it doesn’t have access to embeddings it can compare against.

<div id="S4.SS4.p13" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS4.p13.1" class="ltx_p">The pixel baseline, for both single contact and parallel jaw contact cases, performs most comparably to Tac2Pose for the mini one face grid. The mini one face grid is small and simple enough (one angle, one face) that all methods (excluding pose) perform comparably. For one face and full, Tac2Pose outperforms pixel by about 2-3 times for both single contact and parallel jaw cases, which is still relatively comparable. This implies that pixel is most successful for high resolution grids.
The performance of the pixel baseline method degrades most when the grid is low resolution, particularly when the grid contains object rotations. Bigger mini one face (shown as BMOF in the figure) has 0.71 median normalized error, compared with 0.24 for Tac2Pose (single contact). With parallel jaw contacts, the pixel baseline has 0.71 median normalized error, compared with 0.14 forTac2Pose. Tac2Pose outperforms pixel by nearly 3 times in the single contact case, and more than 5 times in the parallel jaw case. Furthermore, pixel (both single contact and parallel jaw contact cases) is the least effective method when the grid is low resolution but complex.</p>

<div id="S4.SS4.p14" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS4.p14.1" class="ltx_p">When the grid resolution is low, the nearest grid match will be farther (in pixel distance) from an observed contact than when the grid resolution is high. This is particularly harmful for pixel when rotations are introduced, because a rotated version of a remote contact may, by chance, have more pixel overlap with the observed contact than the true closest match. This is much less likely to occur for high resolution grids, in which there exists a very close match on the grid to any observed contact. When the grid is simple (does not contain planar or 3D rotations) pixel can be successful even when the grid resolution is low (as is the case for mini one face) because the best match on the grid is still likely to have the smallest pixel distance. If the grid is sufficiently complex, it must also be high resolution for pixel to be relatively successful (as is the case for one face and full).
It is worth noting that a drawback of pixel, particularly with high resolution grids, is the execution time. In order to choose the best match, an observed contact is compared with contact shapes corresponding to every contact pose in the grid. Execution time is doubled when considering parallel jaw information, because two contacts are compared for each contact pose. Pixel is therefore the slowest method we evaluated by a significant margin. In practice, matching a contact to a high resolution grid in real-time using pixel is likely infeasible. Instead, Tac2Pose only compares low-dimensional embeddings resulting in at least an order of magnitude speed-up.</p>

<p id="S4.SS4.p15.1" class="ltx_p">Finally, Tac2Pose performs consistently for both single and parallel jaw simulated contacts for all grid sizes for hanger. Tac2Pose also outperforms all baselines for all grid sizes. The parallel jaw case of Tac2Pose slightly outperforms the single contact case for all hanger grid sizes, except mini one face, in which the single contact case outperforms parallel jaw by 0.08 versus 0.09 normalized error. Tac2Pose (both single contact and parallel jaw) also performs slightly better for high resolution grids (one face and full).</p>

<p id="S4.SS4.p18.1" class="ltx_p">For real data, and full-sized grids, the performance classification (<span id="S4.SS4.p18.1.1" class="ltx_text" style="color:#00FF00;">green</span> bar), and pixel with a single contact (<span id="S4.SS4.p18.1.2" class="ltx_text" style="color:#FF8000;">dark orange</span> bar) are similar to selecting a contact pose randomly from the grid. The median normalized error is 0.98 for classification, and 0.90 for pixel with a single contact. Pixel with parallel jaw contacts and pose perform better, and have errors almost two times lower than selecting a pose at random from the grid; the median normalized error is 0.59 for pixel with parallel jaw contacts, and 0.53 for pose.
Tac2Pose (<span id="S4.SS4.p18.1.3" class="ltx_text" style="color:#0000FF;">dark blue</span> bar for single contact, <span id="S4.SS4.p18.1.4" class="ltx_text" style="color:#00FFFF;">light blue</span> bar for parallel jaw contacts) significantly outperforms all baselines. The median normalized error for the single contact case is 0.19, and for the parallel jaw contact case is 0.07. Tac2Pose outperforms the next best baseline (pose) by nearly three times for the single contact case, and nearly eight times for the parallel jaw contact case.</p>
</div>
<div id="S4.SS4.p19" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS4.p19.1" class="ltx_p">On simulated versions of the same contacts, pose and pixel (single contact and parallel jaw contact cases) both perform better than they do with real contacts. The median normalized error for pose shrinks by over three times, dropping to 0.17 with simulated data. Similarly, for pixel, the normalized error in simulation shrinks six times for single contact, and over eight times for parallel jaw contacts, dropping to 0.15 and 0.07, respectively. This indicates the sensitivity of both pose and pixel to noise in the contact shapes.
Tac2Pose, in comparison, is more robust to contact shape noise, particularly in the parallel jaw contact case. With simulated contacts, the median normalized error for the parallel jaw case of Tac2Pose shrinks about two times, dropping to 0.03.
Furthermore, despite the better performance of pose and pixel on simulated contacts compared with real contacts, Tac2Pose yields the best performance on simulated contacts as well. With simulated contacts, Tac2Pose is more than twice as good as the next best baseline (pixel with parallel jaw contacts).</p>
</div>
<div id="S4.SS4.p20" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS4.p20.1" class="ltx_p">The primary reason for pixel’s sensitivity to noise in the contact shapes is that it only evaluates the exact 2D location of the contact on the sensor. Tac2Pose, in comparison, is trained to match contact shapes resulting from slight perturbations of grid poses to the closest match on the grid. This makesTac2Pose more robust to slight discrepancies between observed and grid contact shapes.</p>
</div>
<div id="S4.SS4.p21" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS4.p21.1" class="ltx_p">The sensitivity of pose to contact shape noise has to do, instead, with the method’s ability to generalize to out of distribution data in the form of real contact shapes. Both pose and Tac2Pose are trained on simulated versions of contact shapes, but Tac2Pose generalizes to real contact shapes much better. Tac2Pose computes the likelihood of an observed contact matching to a discrete set of simulated shapes. Therefore, the match does not need to be exact, just better than other possible options, for the localization to be accurate. The structure imposed by the grid therefore improves the ability of Tac2Pose to generalize to real, noisy contact shapes. Because pose regresses object poses directly, without the structure of the grid, its performance is more brittle and degrades when using real contacts.</p>
</div>
<div id="S4.SS4.p22" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS4.p22.1" class="ltx_p">The normalized error of classification, even with simulated contacts, is 0.96, remaining similar to selecting a pose randomly from the grid. The size of the grid is too large to be handled with classification (as addressed in Section <a href="#S4.SS4" title="4.4 Comparison with Baselines ‣ 4 Results ‣ Tac2Pose: Tactile Object Pose Estimation from the First Touch." class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4.4</span></a>), so it is not possible to comment on the impact of noisy contacts.</p>
</div>
<div id="S4.SS4.p23" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS4.p23.1" class="ltx_p">For the 5 objects we evaluate (long grease, snap ring, big head, hanger, and cotter), Tac2Pose performs significantly better than random (here, we define significantly better as more than twice as good, which can be identified as a median normalized error less than 0.5 in Table <a href="#S4.T4" title="Table 4 ‣ 4.4 Comparison with Baselines ‣ 4 Results ‣ Tac2Pose: Tactile Object Pose Estimation from the First Touch." class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a>) for 4/5 objects in both the single contact and parallel jaw contact cases. In the parallel jaw contact case, the fifth object, cotter, has median normalized error of 0.51, which is just below twice as a good as random. In comparison, pose, classification, and pixel with a single contact are only significantly better than random for 1/5 objects. Pixel with parallel jaw contacts is significantly better than random for 3/5 objects.
Furthermore, with a single contact, Tac2Pose outperforms all baselines for 4/5 objects. Tac2Pose is between 1.5 and 4 times better than the next best baseline for all objects except for long grease, which performs marginally worse than pose in the single contact case (0.72 median normalized error for pose, compared with 0.76 for Tac2Pose). With parallel jaw contacts, Tac2Pose outperforms pixel, which is the only other method compatible with parallel jaw contacts, with by between 1.5 and 9 times, depending on the object.</p>
</div>
<div id="S4.SS4.p24" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS4.p24.1" class="ltx_p">A final observation is that for some objects, parallel jaw contact versions of pixel and Tac2Pose are more robust to contact shape noise than single contact versions. We consider long grease (results listed in Table <a href="#S4.T4" title="Table 4 ‣ 4.4 Comparison with Baselines ‣ 4 Results ‣ Tac2Pose: Tactile Object Pose Estimation from the First Touch." class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a>) as an example. Tac2Pose with a single real contact has 0.76 median normalized error, compared with 0.09 for the parallel jaw contact case. This means that the localization performance improves around eight times when using parallel jaw contacts. Similarly, pixel with a single contact has 0.93 median normalized error, compared with 0.17 median normalized error with parallel jaw contacts; the localization performance is about 5.5 times better in the parallel jaw contact case.
We also consider the performance of Tac2Pose, and pixel, on simulated contacts to evaluate the impact of contact shape noise on the discrepancy between single and parallel jaw contact cases. With simulated contacts, the localization performance is the same for Tac2Pose for both a single contact and parallel jaw contacts; the median normalized error is 0.03 in both cases. The outcome is similar for pixel; the median normalized error is 0.05 in both the single contact and parallel jaw contact cases. The consistent localization performance between methods and contact configurations when using simulated contacts indicates that contact shape noise is the differentiating factor between single contact and parallel jaw contact cases when using real contacts. This means that robustness to noise is a key advantage of using parallel jaw contacts over a single contact, for both methods.
Both Tac2Pose and pixel have similar performance in the parallel jaw case with real contacts as they do with idealized (simulated) contacts; it is 3 (Tac2Pose ) to 3.5 (pixel) times easier to localize simulated contacts than real contacts. The discrepancy between simulated and real results is much more pronounced in the single contact case of both methods. This implies that the sim-to-real gap can be bridged, in part, by the inclusion of parallel jaw information.</p>
</div>
<div id="S4.SS4.p25" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS4.p25.1" class="ltx_p">We conclude this section with some remarks about the challenge of estimating an object’s pose from a single noisy contact. Tac2Pose outperforms all baselines on 4/5 objects with a single contact, and all objects with parallel jaw contacts. Ultimately, though, even Tac2Pose struggles to perform significantly better than selecting a pose at random from the grid with a single contact for 1/5 objects (where significantly better than random is defined as more than twice as good). Estimating the pose of an object from a single, noisy, often non-unique contact is challenging. Therefore, perhaps the most important feature of Tac2Pose is that it outputs meaningful pose distributions over possible object poses (Figure <a href="#S4.F7.sf1" title="In Figure 7 ‣ 4.2 Real pose estimation results ‣ 4 Results ‣ Tac2Pose: Tactile Object Pose Estimation from the First Touch." class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">7(a)</span></a>). This creates a natural framework for incorporating constraints from additional contacts, measurements of the robot state (such as the gripper opening), information from additional sensing modalities, or even previous tactile estimates of the object pose.</p>

<span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_section">5 </span>Discussion</h2>

<div id="S5.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">This paper presents an approach to tactile pose estimation for objects with known geometry.
Tac2Pose relies on learning an embedding completely in simulation that facilitates comparing real and simulated contact shapes.
We can reconstruct contact shapes with high fidelity, using images from the real sensor and in simulation.
We compare the embeddings of an observed contact shape with those of a precomputed dense set of simulated contact shapes to obtain the distribution over a dense set of possible object poses.
The approach therefore allows to reason over pose distributions and to handle additional pose constraints.
</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p2.1" class="ltx_p">We evaluate Tac2Pose on real grasp datasets for 20 objects, and report the accuracy for three ablations of Tac2Pose, corresponding to increasing amounts of information from a given grasp.
First, we evaluate the accuracy using a single tactile image which corresponds to the case where only one contact is available to the algorithm.
Second, we consider the case where two tactile images (corresponding to a parallel jaw grasp on the object) and the gripper opening are available.
Third, we evaluate the accuracy after filtering the distribution obtained using parallel jaw information with a coarse prior on the object pose, approximating the case where information from an additional sensing modality (e.g. vision) is available.</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p3.1" class="ltx_p">We find that the amount of information needed to localize an arbitrary grasp on an object accurately is highly dependent on the object geometry.
Of the 20 objects we evaluate, 9 can be localized accurately with a single contact. For these objects, more than half of arbitrary grasps on the object can be localized accurately. The objects that can be localized accurately with a single contact tend to be smaller, and have significant regions of unique contacts.
When including parallel jaw information, the number of objects that can be localized accurately using the best match from Tac2Pose increases to 12. The objects that can be localized accurately after including parallel jaw information tend to have pseudosymmetrical features which can be disambiguated with a second contact, or vary significantly in width across the length of the object, which makes the gripper opening a discriminative source of information.
After filtering the parallel jaw pose distribution with a coarse 10mm prior on the object pose, the number of objects that can be localized accurately increases to 16.
The objects that can be localized accurately after including a coarse prior on the object pose tend to be larger, and have <span id="S5.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">discrete nonuninquess</span> (features that are unique, with a discrete number of exceptions on remote regions of the object).</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p4.1" class="ltx_p">There are, however, four objects which cannot be localized accurately on average even after filtering the parallel jaw distribution with a 10mm prior and selecting the resulting most likely object pose. These objects are large, and have significant, continuous regions of non-unique contacts. The majority of contacts on such objects do not provide enough information to uniquely determine their pose.</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Even objects which can be, on average, localized accurately from an arbitrary grasp have regions of non-unique contacts that do not provide enough information to uniquely determine the object pose.
It is therefore important to evaluate the localization accuracy of specific grasps on objects, as well as arbitrary grasps. To this end, we compare the localization accuracy separated out by grasp approach direction, and the localization accuracy of individual grasps on selected objects.
We find that many objects have one direction which is significantly easier to localize (half as much error or less) than others. By examining individual grasps on the object long pencil, we find that even objects with large, continuous regions of non-unique contacts have regions that are more unique and easier to localize.</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p6.1" class="ltx_p">Both of these breakdowns (sets broken out by grasp approach direction, or individual grasps) could ultimately be leveraged in a grasp planning framework, in which grasps that are easier to localize are specifically targeted. In practice, grasps within a given grasp approach direction could be targeted with a very coarse prior on the object pose, while a specific individual grasp could be targeted with somewhat finer information about the object pose.
Because Tac2Pose is trained entirely in simulation, it is possible to evaluate which grasps lead to lower localization error in advance of encountering the object. For instance, the output pose distributions we obtain using simulated and real contact shapes on long pencil are qualitatively similar (Figure <a href="#S4.F7.sf1" title="In Figure 7 ‣ 4.2 Real pose estimation results ‣ 4 Results ‣ Tac2Pose: Tactile Object Pose Estimation from the First Touch." class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">7(a)</span></a> and <a href="#S4.F7.sf2" title="In Figure 7 ‣ 4.2 Real pose estimation results ‣ 4 Results ‣ Tac2Pose: Tactile Object Pose Estimation from the First Touch." class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">7(b)</span></a>). Simulated contacts can therefore be used to identify unique and non-unique candidate grasps. This feature, too, could be important to leverage in a manipulation planning framework.</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.p7" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p7.1" class="ltx_p">Our approach also assumes we have access to accurate geometric models of objects. We demonstrate that Tac2Pose can be effectively combined with object models reconstructed from a 3D scanner.
A key feature of Tac2Pose is the ability to refine coarse estimates of object pose with high resolution tactile information. We find that moderate shape noise does not significantly compromise that ability for any of the 5 objects we evaluate.</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.p8" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p8.1" class="ltx_p">Future work could learn embeddings that are even more robust to shape uncertainty by corrupting the contact shapes with noise during training. This would not inherently improve the localization accuracy when considering only information from a single grasp, but could yield distributions that are more representative of our true confidence in the estimate. These distributions could be combined effectively with other information (e.g. pose priors, additional tactile measurements, or dynamics) to converge on a unique estimate of the object pose.</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.p9" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p9.1" class="ltx_p">We demonstrate the advantages of Tac2Pose compared with baseline methods for estimating object pose from tactile images. Compared with a standard classification approach, direct pose regression, and direct pixel comparison, Tac2Pose scales better to larger, and more complex problems (e.g. regressing 6D object pose rather than simply translation or rotation in plane) and is more robust to contact shape noise.</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.p10" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p10.1" class="ltx_p">In summary, we demonstrate the effectiveness of Tac2Pose at pose estimation for 20 objects with information gathered from a single, real grasp on the object. We consider known and reconstructed object shapes, and show that in both cases Tac2Pose outputs meaningful distributions over object pose that can be maximized directly, or combined with additional information to converge on a unique estimate of object pose. While Tac2Pose is trained entirely in simulation, it is robust to real and noisy contact shapes arising from both sensor noise and object shape noise. This robustness stands in contrast baseline methods, which are more sensitive to contact shape noise. This suggests that matching estimated contact shapes to a dense precomputed set opens the door to moving many computations into simulation, without loss of robustness, and improving how robots learn to perceive and manipulate their environment.</p>

<p id="A2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">To get calibrated real pairs of contact poses and tactile observations, we first obtain a coarse estimate of the object pose using an overhead camera. We then refine that estimate using Tac2Pose for geometric contact rendering: we move the robot to our coarse estimate of the object pose, grasp the object, and compare the observed contact with the simulated contact shape in the estimated pose. We adjust the estimate of the object pose until the observed contact matches the simulated one.</p>

We break out the labelled datasets by grasp approach direction, to facilitate insight about what categories of grasps are easier to localize for different objects.
For each grasp approach direction, we collect a set of equispaced observations, that correspond to a given grasp approach direction at various x,y locations relative to the object. In total, these observations correspond to the set of contacts that we are likely to encounter when picking up each object from a table.</p>

<div id="A3.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="A3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Given a new contact shape, we want to compare it to all pre-computed contact shapes in the grid to find what poses are more likely to produce it.
To that aim, we use MOCO <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(He et al. <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>)</cite>, a widely used tool in contrastive learning, to train a NN that encodes contact shapes into a low dimensional embedding allowing to compare them using the distance between their encodings.</p>
</div>
<div id="A3.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="A3.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The NN encoder is a pre-trained ResNet-50 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(He et al. <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">2016</a>)</cite> cropped before the average-pooling layer to preserve spatial information. It encodes contact shapes into vectors of dimension 1000.
To train, we use the same optimizer as <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">He et al. (<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>)</cite>: stochastic gradient descent with a learning rate that starts at 0.03 and decays over time, momentum of 0.999, and no weight decay.
Each training datapoint comes from selecting a random contact pose, rendering its contact shape, and finding its closest pose in the pre-computed grid. Then our input is the contact shape. The output or label is a vector with all entries zeros except the one that corresponds to the closest element that gets a one. This vector represents the probability of each poses in the grid to be the closest to the target pose.
The loss function is the cross-entropy loss between the label and the softmax between the target encoder and the ones from the grid (see Fig. <a href="#S3.F3" title="Figure 3 ‣ 3.3 Global tactile pose estimation ‣ 3 Method ‣ Tac2Pose: Tactile Object Pose Estimation from the First Touch." class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a>).

<p id="A6.p1.2" class="ltx_p">Our error metric - median error of the best match - does not capture the error distributions for round clip well.
