<p id="id12.id1" class="ltx_p">Multi-sensor fusion (MSF) is widely adopted for perception in autonomous vehicles (AVs), particularly for the task of 3D object detection with camera and LiDAR sensors. The rationale behind fusion is to capitalize on the strengths of each modality while mitigating their limitations. The exceptional and leading performance of fusion models has been demonstrated by advanced deep neural network (DNN)-based fusion techniques. Fusion models are also perceived as more robust to attacks compared to single-modal ones due to the redundant information in multiple modalities.
In this work, we challenge this perspective with single-modal attacks that targets the camera modality, which is considered less significant in fusion but more affordable for attackers. We argue that the weakest link of fusion models depends on their most vulnerable modality, and propose an attack framework that targets advanced camera-LiDAR fusion models with adversarial patches.
Our approach employs a two-stage optimization-based strategy that first comprehensively assesses vulnerable image areas under adversarial attacks, and then applies customized attack strategies to different fusion models, generating deployable patches. Evaluations with five state-of-the-art camera-LiDAR fusion models on a real-world dataset show that our attacks successfully compromise all models. Our approach can either reduce the mean average precision (mAP) of detection performance from 0.824 to 0.353 or degrade the detection score of the target object from 0.727 to 0.151 on average, demonstrating the effectiveness and practicality of our proposed attack framework.</p>

<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The rapid progress in machine learning and deep neural networks has been a key driver of innovation in autonomous driving. As a result, the autonomous driving industry has achieved Level-4 automation on public roads, as evidenced by Baidu Apollo<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>, Google Waymo<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>, and AutoX<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>. To attain full automation, autonomous vehicles (AVs) require an exceptional perception capacity to comprehend their surrounding environment. Given that perception accuracy directly influences the operational safety of autonomous driving, it has attracted significant attention in recent years.</p>

<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In this study, we primarily concentrate on the safety-critical perception task of 3D object detection, presenting the first attack against advanced camera-LiDAR fusion models by exclusively utilizing the camera modality. In 3D object detection, AVs employ camera and/or LiDAR sensor input to predict the location, size, and categories of surrounding objects. Fusion models, which capitalize on both the high-resolution 2D color and texture information from RGB images provided by cameras and the rich 3D distance information from LiDAR point clouds, have surpassed their solely camera-based or LiDAR-based counterparts in detection accuracy <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib69" title="" class="ltx_ref">69</a>, <a href="#bib.bib50" title="" class="ltx_ref">50</a>, <a href="#bib.bib47" title="" class="ltx_ref">47</a>]</cite>. Furthermore, multi-sensor fusion (MSF) techniques are generally perceived as more robust to attacks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>, <a href="#bib.bib48" title="" class="ltx_ref">48</a>]</cite>, as the additional modality offers supplementary information for verifying detection results. Viewed in this light, a counter-intuitive yet innovative question arises: <span id="S1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">❶</span> <span id="S1.p2.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Can we
attack fusion models through a single modality, even the less significant one, thereby directly challenging the security assumption of fusion model robustness</span>? Yet, this fundamental question has not been sufficiently answered in the literature.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Previous research has demonstrated successful attacks against camera-LiDAR fusion models by targeting either multiple modalities <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>, <a href="#bib.bib59" title="" class="ltx_ref">59</a>]</cite> or the LiDAR modality alone <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">39</a>]</cite>. However, these approaches are not easy to implement and require additional equipment such as photodiodes, laser diodes <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">39</a>]</cite>, and industrial-grade 3D printers <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>, <a href="#bib.bib59" title="" class="ltx_ref">59</a>]</cite> to manipulate LiDAR data, thus increasing the deployment cost for attackers. Consequently, we explore the possibility of attacking fusion models via the camera modality, as attackers can more easily perturb captured images using affordable adversarial patches.
Nevertheless, as detailed in Section <a href="#S4.SS1" title="4.1 Challenges of Single-Modal Attacks ‣ 4 Challenges and Motivation ‣ Fusion is Not Enough: Single-Modal Attacks to Compromise Fusion Models in Autonomous Driving" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4.1</span></a>, this attack design presents additional challenges. For example, the camera modality is considered less significant in fusion models for 3D object detection, because LiDAR provides abundant 3D information.
The performance of both state-of-the-art LiDAR-based models
and ablations of fusion models using LiDAR surpasses their solely camera-based counterparts significantly <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib48" title="" class="ltx_ref">48</a>, <a href="#bib.bib50" title="" class="ltx_ref">50</a>, <a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>.
The less significance of camera modality in fusion limits its impact on detection results. Moreover, different fusion models may exhibit distinct vulnerabilities in the camera modality, necessitating varying attack strategies. The cutting-edge patch optimization technique <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite> has limitations in generating deployable adversarial patches, as they fail to consider the semantics of the input scene.
Hence, a problem remains open: <span id="S1.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">❷</span> <span id="S1.p3.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">How to design single-modal attack to effectively subvert fusion models?</span></p>

<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.2" class="ltx_p">In response to <span id="S1.p4.2.1" class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">❷</span>, we propose a novel attack framework against camera-LiDAR fusion models through the less significant camera modality and leave the LiDAR data benign. We utilize adversarial patches as the attack vector, aiming to compromise fusion models and cause false negatives in object detection.
As illustrated in Figure <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ Fusion is Not Enough: Single-Modal Attacks to Compromise Fusion Models in Autonomous Driving" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>, our attack employs a two-stage approach to generate an optimal adversarial patch for the target fusion model. In the first stage (2<sup id="S1.p4.2.2" class="ltx_sup"><span id="S1.p4.2.2.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">nd</span></sup> row of Figure <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ Fusion is Not Enough: Single-Modal Attacks to Compromise Fusion Models in Autonomous Driving" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>), we identify vulnerable regions in the image input using our novel sensitive region recognition algorithm. This optimization-based method employs a trainable mask to simultaneously identify the sensitivity of different image areas under adversarial attacks, providing a comprehensive inspection of the vulnerabilities and regions of interest in the camera modality for a specific fusion model. Based on the identified vulnerable regions, we then classify fusion models as either object-sensitive or globally sensitive, enabling tailored attack strategies for each type of model. In the second stage (3<sup id="S1.p4.2.3" class="ltx_sup"><span id="S1.p4.2.3.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">rd</span></sup> row of Figure <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ Fusion is Not Enough: Single-Modal Attacks to Compromise Fusion Models in Autonomous Driving" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>), we implement different attack strategies for the two types of models to maximize our attack performance. For globally sensitive models, we devise scene-oriented attacks, wherein adversarial patches can be placed on background environments (e.g., roads or walls) to compromise the detection of arbitrary nearby objects (see undetected pedestrians in the red circle at the bottom of Figure <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ Fusion is Not Enough: Single-Modal Attacks to Compromise Fusion Models in Autonomous Driving" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>). For object-sensitive models, we design object-oriented attacks that can compromise the detection of a specific target object by attaching the patch to it (see the undetected vehicle in the red circle of Figure <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ Fusion is Not Enough: Single-Modal Attacks to Compromise Fusion Models in Autonomous Driving" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>). Compared to the prior patch optimization technique <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite>, the patches generated by our proposed framework offer a significant advantage by being both physically deployable and effective.

These sensors include cameras, LiDARs, radars, IMUs, GPS, among others, with the perception module being the first component in the AV system to process the sensor data. Perception tasks encompass road lane detection <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>, <a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite>, traffic sign/light recognition <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib76" title="" class="ltx_ref">76</a>, <a href="#bib.bib44" title="" class="ltx_ref">44</a>]</cite>, 3D object detection <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib48" title="" class="ltx_ref">48</a>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>, <a href="#bib.bib69" title="" class="ltx_ref">69</a>, <a href="#bib.bib47" title="" class="ltx_ref">47</a>]</cite>, etc. Many tasks rely on camera sensors and utilize neural networks to extract semantic information from image inputs. However, the 3D object detection is a more challenging and security-critical task, as it requires understanding the three-dimensional nature of the world and identifying obstacles. Hence, sensor fusion techniques are introduced in 3D object detection, leveraging camera and LiDAR sensors for enhanced accuracy in detection outcomes. Some production-grade AVs utilize fully vision-based perception algorithms (e.g., Tesla), while most others adopt camera-LiDAR fusion-based techniques (e.g., Baidu Apollo <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite> and Google Waymo <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>). The output of 3D object detection models generally consists of 3D bounding boxes, object categories, and detection scores for objects within the scene. Detection results and other perception outputs are utilized by subsequent modules in AV systems for object tracking, trajectory prediction, route planning, and driving control.</p>

<p id="S2.p2.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S2.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Camera-LiDAR fusion.</span> AVs are equipped with multiple cameras around the vehicle, providing a comprehensive 360-degree view. LiDAR sensors are typically mounted centrally on top of the vehicle, enabling a 360-degree scan of the surrounding environment with laser beams, resulting in a 3D point cloud. Images and point clouds represent distinct modalities, and numerous prior works have investigated methods to effectively fuse them for improved object detection performance. Specificially, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">39</a>]</cite> categorizes fusion strategies into three groups based on the stage of fusion: 1) cascaded semantic-level fusion, which employs a single-modal detection result to augment the input of the other modality <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib65" title="" class="ltx_ref">65</a>, <a href="#bib.bib52" title="" class="ltx_ref">52</a>]</cite>; 2) integrated semantic-level fusion, which conducts independent perception for each modality and subsequently fuses the semantic outputs <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>; and 3) feature-level fusion, which combines low-level machine-learned features from each modality to yield unified detection results. Feature-level fusion can be further divided into alignment-based and non-alignment-based fusion. Alignment-based fusion entails aligning camera and LiDAR features through dimension projection at the point level <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib46" title="" class="ltx_ref">46</a>, <a href="#bib.bib62" title="" class="ltx_ref">62</a>, <a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite>, the voxel level <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib47" title="" class="ltx_ref">47</a>, <a href="#bib.bib41" title="" class="ltx_ref">41</a>]</cite>, the proposal level <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>, <a href="#bib.bib43" title="" class="ltx_ref">43</a>]</cite>, or the bird’s eye view <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib50" title="" class="ltx_ref">50</a>, <a href="#bib.bib48" title="" class="ltx_ref">48</a>]</cite> before concatenation. For non-alignment-based fusion, cross-attention mechanisms in the transformer architecture are employed for combining different modalities <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib69" title="" class="ltx_ref">69</a>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>.

From left to right, multi-view images obtained from cameras and the point cloud data from LiDAR sensors are initially processed independently by neural networks to extract image and LiDAR features. The networks responsible for feature extraction are commonly referred to as “<span id="S2.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">backbones</span>”, which encompass ResNet50 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib40" title="" class="ltx_ref">40</a>]</cite>, ResNet101 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib40" title="" class="ltx_ref">40</a>]</cite>, SwinTransformer <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib49" title="" class="ltx_ref">49</a>]</cite> for images, and SECOND <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib68" title="" class="ltx_ref">68</a>]</cite>, PointNet <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib53" title="" class="ltx_ref">53</a>]</cite>, VoxelNet <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib75" title="" class="ltx_ref">75</a>]</cite> for point cloud data, among others. Subsequently, the extracted features from each modality are fused together employing either alignment-based or non-alignment-based designs, which vary from model to model.
After fusion, a detection head is employed to generate the final predictions. The 3D object detection head generally adopts a transformer decoder-based architecture in cutting-edge fusion models, as the efficacy of transformers in object detection has been substantiated by DETR <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite>. In the transformer-based detection head, the input consists of three sequences of feature vectors named queries (Q), keys (K) and values (V). Each input query vector corresponds to an output vector, representing detection results for an object, including bounding box, object category, and detection score. Input keys and values, derived from fused features, provide scene-specific semantic information. The initial queries generation in various models exhibits distinct design characteristics. For instance, UVTR <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib47" title="" class="ltx_ref">47</a>]</cite> uses learnable parameters as queries,
DeepInteraction <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib69" title="" class="ltx_ref">69</a>]</cite> and TransFusion <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite> employ LiDAR features sampled from fused features, while BEVFusion-MIT <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib50" title="" class="ltx_ref">50</a>]</cite> and BEVFusion-PKU <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib48" title="" class="ltx_ref">48</a>]</cite> utilize bird’s eye view fused features. The decoder output is subsequently processed by a Feed-Forward Network (FFN) for final regression and classification results. In this work, we study camera-LiDAR fusion models using feature-level fusion and our attack is general to both alignment-based and non-alignment-based fusion approaches regardless of the design of detection head.</p>

<p id="S2.p4.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S2.p4.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">AV perception attacks.</span> AV perception models predominantly rely on Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), which are known to be susceptible to adversarial attacks. Consequently, various attacks have been developed against AV perception tasks, including road lane detection <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib54" title="" class="ltx_ref">54</a>]</cite>, traffic sign/light recognition <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib74" title="" class="ltx_ref">74</a>, <a href="#bib.bib58" title="" class="ltx_ref">58</a>, <a href="#bib.bib56" title="" class="ltx_ref">56</a>, <a href="#bib.bib73" title="" class="ltx_ref">73</a>]</cite>, monocular depth estimation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite>, and 3D object detection <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib70" title="" class="ltx_ref">70</a>, <a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>, <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>, <a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">39</a>, <a href="#bib.bib59" title="" class="ltx_ref">59</a>, <a href="#bib.bib60" title="" class="ltx_ref">60</a>, <a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib57" title="" class="ltx_ref">57</a>, <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>. 3D object detection models can be classified into three categories: camera-based, LiDAR-based, and fusion-based models. Attacks targeting each category have been proposed in the context of AV systems. For camera-based models, adversaries typically employ adversarial textures to manipulate the pixels captured by AV cameras <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib70" title="" class="ltx_ref">70</a>, <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>. This approach is cost-effective and can be easily implemented through printing and pasting. Recent studies have concentrated on enhancing the stealthiness of the adversarial patterns <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>, <a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>]</cite>. In the case of LiDAR-based models, some attackers utilize auxiliary equipment, such as photodiodes and laser diodes, to intercept and relay the laser beams emitted by AV LiDAR systems, thereby generating malicious points in the acquired point cloud for the attack <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>, <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>, <a href="#bib.bib57" title="" class="ltx_ref">57</a>]</cite>. Alternatively, others employ malicious physical objects with engineered shapes to introduce adversarial points for the attack <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib60" title="" class="ltx_ref">60</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>. Regarding camera-LiDAR fusion models, multi-modal attacks have been developed that perturb both camera and LiDAR input either separately <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib59" title="" class="ltx_ref">59</a>]</cite> or concurrently <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>, using the previously mentioned attack vectors. Additionally, single-modal attacks on LiDAR input have been conducted in a black-box manner <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">39</a>]</cite>. To the best of our knowledge, our study is the first to explore single-modal attacks on fusion models through the camera modality, and we successfully compromise state-of-the-art fusion models using deployable adversarial patches.</p>

<p id="S3.p1.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S3.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Attack goal. </span> The primary goal of our attack is to undermine the object detection capabilities of sensor fusion models employed in autonomous driving systems. We examine the feasibility of exploiting single-modal attacks to deceive multi-modal sensor fusion models, leading to false negative detection results. The inability to detect objects (e.g., pedestrians, traffic barriers, and vehicles) can have disastrous consequences, putting human lives at risk.
Although single-modal attacks are relatively easier to deploy than multi-modal attacks, they present additional challenges.
Previous studies have investigated the potential of defeating sensor fusion systems by targeting the LiDAR input <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">39</a>]</cite> or both the camera and LiDAR inputs <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib59" title="" class="ltx_ref">59</a>, <a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>. However, achieving this objective by attacking only the camera input remains an open research problem.</p>

<p id="S3.p2.27" class="ltx_p"><span id="S3.p2.27.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Threat model.</span> Our attack assumes that the attacker has complete knowledge of the camera-LiDAR fusion model used by the target autonomous driving vehicle. Therefore, our attack model is considered to be in a white-box setting. This assumption is consistent with similar works in the literature that implement adversarial attacks on autonomous driving systems <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib56" title="" class="ltx_ref">56</a>, <a href="#bib.bib73" title="" class="ltx_ref">73</a>, <a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>, <a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>, <a href="#bib.bib71" title="" class="ltx_ref">71</a>, <a href="#bib.bib54" title="" class="ltx_ref">54</a>, <a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>. This assumption can be realized through reverse engineering the perception system of the victim vehicle, which has been demonstrated in systems like Tesla Autopilot <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>, or through the utilization of open-sourced systems such as Baidu Apollo <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite> and Autoware.ai <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>. Secondly, we assume that the attacker has the capability to deploy an adversarial patch onto the ground or a target object, which is practical in the physical world with the patch generated by our framework. We employ Estimation of Transformation (EoT)<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite> to enhance the physical-world performance, similar to approaches in<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>, <a href="#bib.bib54" title="" class="ltx_ref">54</a>]</cite>.

<p id="S4.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S4.SS1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Fusion models may exhibit increased robustness.</span> Sensor fusion aims to capitalize on the advantages of each modality while mitigating their limitations.
Fusing these modalities has been proven to outperform single-modal models in tasks such as 3D object detection <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib48" title="" class="ltx_ref">48</a>]</cite>, tracking <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib64" title="" class="ltx_ref">64</a>]</cite>, and map segmentation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib50" title="" class="ltx_ref">50</a>]</cite>. Given the vulnerability of single-modal models to adversarial attacks, researchers seek to improve robustness through fusion techniques, as additional modalities can provide supplementary information for verifying detection results. Traditional fusion methods, such as the Kalman Filter <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib66" title="" class="ltx_ref">66</a>]</cite>, have demonstrated resilience against attacks like sensor spoofing <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib77" title="" class="ltx_ref">77</a>, <a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite>. Thus, multi-modal models may render single-modal attacks more challenging.</p>

<p id="S4.SS1.p3.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S4.SS1.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Modalities may exhibit varying significance.</span> Since camera and LiDAR sensors provide distinct information for 3D object detection (i.e., texture from cameras and depth from LiDAR), fusion models may assign different weights based on each modality’s contribution to the final decision. LiDAR is often considered more critical for 3D object detection due to its rich 3D information. Furthermore, state-of-the-art single-modal 3D object detection models and ablation studies of fusion models with single modality demonstrate that LiDAR-based models outperform camera-based models significantly <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib48" title="" class="ltx_ref">48</a>, <a href="#bib.bib50" title="" class="ltx_ref">50</a>, <a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite>, further validating the varying importance of these modalities. Consequently, attacking through a less important modality (e.g., the camera) may be challenging.</p>

<p id="S4.SS1.p4.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S4.SS1.p4.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Attack strategy may depend on fusion approaches.</span> Multi-modal 3D object detection models employ various fusion approaches to integrate features from different modalities. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">39</a>]</cite>, fusion approaches are classified into cascaded semantic-level fusion, integrated semantic-level fusion, and feature-level fusion, while in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib48" title="" class="ltx_ref">48</a>]</cite>, they are categorized into point-level fusion, feature-level fusion, and bird-eye-view fusion. Different fusion models may result in disparate vulnerabilities, when only a single modality is attacked. For example, when the adversary tries to attack through the camera input, susceptible input regions may differ among these vulnerabilities. Consequently, different attack strategies may be required to maximize attack performance, increasing the complexity of attack design.</p>

However, the effectiveness of such attacks on complex and practical fusion models remains unknown. Thus, we present an example to illustrate our examination of state-of-the-art fusion models using real-world data.
We select a frame from a scene in the Nuscenes dataset <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite> containing both camera and LiDAR data (refer to the first row of Figure <a href="#S4.F4" title="Figure 4 ‣ 4.1 Challenges of Single-Modal Attacks ‣ 4 Challenges and Motivation ‣ Fusion is Not Enough: Single-Modal Attacks to Compromise Fusion Models in Autonomous Driving" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a>). In this scene, the ego-vehicle navigates a road with multiple cars and pedestrians in the vicinity. State-of-the-art camera-LiDAR fusion models, namely DeepInteraction <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib69" title="" class="ltx_ref">69</a>]</cite> and BEVFusion-PKU <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib48" title="" class="ltx_ref">48</a>]</cite>, can detect the positions, dimensions and classes of surrounding objects correctly. We then perform a traditional adversarial patch attack <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite> and define a patch on the road ahead of the victim vehicle (i.e., ego-vehicle). We optimize the patch content to cause false negative detection of objects, while keeping LiDAR data unaltered. The results for DeepInteraction and BEVFusion-PKU are depicted in the second and third rows of Figure <a href="#S4.F4" title="Figure 4 ‣ 4.1 Challenges of Single-Modal Attacks ‣ 4 Challenges and Motivation ‣ Fusion is Not Enough: Single-Modal Attacks to Compromise Fusion Models in Autonomous Driving" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a>, respectively. As illustrated in the second row, DeepInteraction’s object detection remains unaffected by the patch. However, our attack successfully compromises BEVFusion-PKU, causing it to fail in detecting objects near the patch, as indicated by the red circles in the third row of Figure <a href="#S4.F4" title="Figure 4 ‣ 4.1 Challenges of Single-Modal Attacks ‣ 4 Challenges and Motivation ‣ Fusion is Not Enough: Single-Modal Attacks to Compromise Fusion Models in Autonomous Driving" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a>. The success in attacking BEVFusion-PKU confirms the feasibility of attacking a fusion model through manipulating a single modality input, even if it is a less significant one. Moreover, the failure to attack DeepInteraction reveals that a uniform attack strategy and location cannot prevail across all fusion models, as different models may exhibit unique vulnerabilities such as distinct susceptible areas.</p>

<p id="S4.SS2.p4.2" class="ltx_p"><span id="S4.SS2.p4.2.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Our two-stage approach.</span>
To automatically identify the most susceptible area in the input image under adversarial attacks and maximize the attack effect on camera-LiDAR fusion models, we propose a two-stage approach. In the first stage, we aim to identify vulnerable regions of the subject model for adversarial attacks on the camera-modality. In the second stage, we generate an adversarial patch based on the identified vulnerable region to maximize the attacking effect. To characterize the vulnerable regions, we introduce the concept of “<span id="S4.SS2.p4.2.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">sensitivity</span>” as a property of areas in input images. Sensitivity measures the degree to which specific area of an image impacts adversarial goals when perturbations are introduced. An area with high sensitivity means perturbations there have large influence and can achieve good attack performance. Hence, sensitive regions are more vulnerable to adversarial attacks than other regions.

Examining the sensitivity of each area on the image through individual patch optimization is very time consuming. Moreover, it becomes increasingly unaffordable as the granularity of the considered unit area increases. Despite the availability of numerous decision interpretation methods, such as GradCAM <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib55" title="" class="ltx_ref">55</a>]</cite> and ScoreCAM <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib63" title="" class="ltx_ref">63</a>]</cite>, which generate heatmaps to illustrate areas of attention within images, these techniques are not designed for complex fusion models, thus rendering their direct application challenging. Furthermore, it is essential to differentiate between model decision interpretation and sensitivity recognition, as the motivating example provided demonstrates the road as a susceptible region for adversarial attacks in some models, whereas the primary focus of object detection should be directed towards the objects themselves, as an interpretation method would show. Therefore, to recognize the sensitivity distribution on input images efficiently, we propose a novel optimization-based method in the first stage. Based on this, we classify the distribution into two types: object sensitivity and global sensitivity. In the second stage, we launch adversarial patch attacks on sensitive areas and leverage different attack strategies to either customize the attack effect (e.g., false negative detection) to a specific object or maximize the effect to arbitrary surrounding objects. Our evaluation with five state-of-the-art camera-LiDAR fusion models published in 2022 validates the efficacy of our attack framework and each model with unique sensitivity distributions can be compromised to produce false negative detection results via highly-practical adversarial patches. Regarding the one-stage regional patch optimization technique<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite>, it could complement our two-stage approach by integrating into the second stage to refine the patch area after vulnerable regions have been identified.</p>

Initially, we identify the sensitivity distribution of the subject network, and subsequently, we launch an attack based on the identified sensitivity type.
During the first stage, to recognize the sensitivity distribution, we define perturbations and universal perturbation masks with dimensions identical to the multi-view image input. We then compose the adversarial input by applying the patch and mask to images of a scene sampled from the dataset (step <span id="S5.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">①</span>). After feeding the adversarial input images and corresponding benign LiDAR data to the subject fusion model, we obtain object detection results (step <span id="S5.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">②</span>). We calculate the adversarial loss based on the detection scores of objects in the input scene (step <span id="S5.p1.1.3" class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">③</span>) and utilize backpropagation and gradient descent algorithm to update masks and perturbations, aiming to minimize adversarial loss and mask loss (step <span id="S5.p1.1.4" class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">④</span>). We repeat this process for thousands of iterations until convergence is achieved, and then visualize the final mask as a heatmap to determine the sensitivity type (step <span id="S5.p1.1.5" class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">⑤</span>). The heatmap’s high-intensity regions signify areas more susceptible to adversarial attacks. Based on the distribution of sensitive areas, we classify the heatmap into two types: <span id="S5.p1.1.6" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">global sensitivity</span> and <span id="S5.p1.1.7" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">object sensitivity</span>. Global sensitivity refers to the distribution of sensitive areas covering the entire scene, including objects and non-object background. Object sensitivity, on the other hand, indicates that only object areas are sensitive, while non-object parts exhibit lower intensity on the heatmap.</p>

<div id="S5.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p2.6" class="ltx_p">In the second stage of our attack framework, we adopt different attack strategies based on the identified sensitivity heatmap type. For global sensitivity, we implement scene-oriented attacks. By placing a patch on the static non-object background (e.g., roads and walls), we deceive the fusion model on the victim vehicle and compromise the detection of untargeted objects surrounding the patch within the scene. For both object sensitivity and global sensitivity, we can employ object-oriented attacks. In this approach, we attach a patch to the target object, causing the object detection model on the victim vehicle to fail in detecting the target object while leaving the detection of other objects unaltered. Since adversarial patches, optimized as 2D images, should be placed in a 3D environment during attacks, directly pasting these patches onto scene images results in unrealistic synthesis and a greater disparity between physical scenarios and experimental conditions, thereby reducing practicality.
Consequently, we employ projections proposed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite> to account for the structure of the physical world while synthesizing the adversarial scene image.

As shown, pixels of the 2D patch image are first projected to 3D coordinates in the physical world (see step <span id="S5.p2.6.1" class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">❶</span>) and then projected back to pixels on the captured scene image (step <span id="S5.p2.6.2" class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">❷</span>), connecting the patch image with the patch area in the scene image. Specifically, in the scene-oriented attacks, the patch can be horizontal on the ground, and we define the longitudinal distance <math id="S5.p2.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="d" display="inline"><semantics id="S5.p2.1.m1.1a"><mi id="S5.p2.1.m1.1.1" xref="S5.p2.1.m1.1.1.cmml">d</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S5.p2.1.m1.1b"><ci id="S5.p2.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S5.p2.1.m1.1.1">𝑑</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S5.p2.1.m1.1c">d</annotation></semantics></math>, the lateral

<p id="S5.SS1.p5.4" class="ltx_p">The optimization of these two losses is a dual process. Minimizing the adversarial loss (i.e., maximizing attack performance) necessitates a higher magnitude of perturbations on the input. Conversely, minimizing the mask loss indicates a lower magnitude of perturbations. As a result, the dual optimization process converges on applying higher magnitude perturbations on sensitive areas (to improve attack performance) and lower magnitudes for insensitive parts (to minimize mask loss).

The first row displays the scene images captured by the front camera of the ego vehicle while the subsequent rows exhibit the sensitivity distributions, i.e., sensitivity heatmaps, of the corresponding scene image using different models. The brightness or warmth of colors in the heatmap corresponds to the sensitivity of a particular region to adversarial attacks. Higher brightness areas signify higher susceptibility to attacks, while lower brightness denotes more robustness. Observe that the sensitive regions for the initial three models, namely Transfusion <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>, DeepInteraction <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib69" title="" class="ltx_ref">69</a>]</cite> and UVTR <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib47" title="" class="ltx_ref">47</a>]</cite>, primarily lie on objects like vehicles and pedestrians. This suggests that attacks on objects could prove to be more effective, whereas non-object areas such as the road and walls are more resistant. The last two models (BEVFusion-MIT <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib50" title="" class="ltx_ref">50</a>]</cite> and BEVFusion-PKU <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib48" title="" class="ltx_ref">48</a>]</cite>) demonstrate high sensitivities throughout the entire scene, irrespective of objects or background regions. This indicates their vulnerability at a global level. Since different sensitivity types demonstrate distinct level of vulnerabilities, we discuss the reason behind in our defence discussion (Section <a href="#S7" title="7 Defence Discussion and Limitations ‣ Fusion is Not Enough: Single-Modal Attacks to Compromise Fusion Models in Autonomous Driving" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">7</span></a>).</p>

To validate the utility of sensitivity heatmaps in identifying vulnerable regions to adversarial attacks, we employ traditional image-specific adversarial patch on regions with distinct levels of sensitivity and evaluate the adversarial performance on two fusion models (i.e., DeepInteraction and BEVFusion-PKU) with distinct sensitivity types.
We define a patch on both object and non-object areas to compare models’ vulnerabilities since the two areas demonstrate different brightness on the sensitivity heatmap of DeepInteraction. More specifically, we define a patch area of size <math id="S6.SS2.p3.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="50\times 50" display="inline"><semantics id="S6.SS2.p3.1.m1.1a"><mrow id="S6.SS2.p3.1.m1.1.1" xref="S6.SS2.p3.1.m1.1.1.cmml"><mn id="S6.SS2.p3.1.m1.1.1.2" xref="S6.SS2.p3.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml">50</mn><mo lspace="0.222em" rspace="0.222em" id="S6.SS2.p3.1.m1.1.1.1" xref="S6.SS2.p3.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml">×</mo><mn id="S6.SS2.p3.1.m1.1.1.3" xref="S6.SS2.p3.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml">50</mn></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S6.SS2.p3.1.m1.1b"><apply id="S6.SS2.p3.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S6.SS2.p3.1.m1.1.1"><times id="S6.SS2.p3.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S6.SS2.p3.1.m1.1.1.1"></times><cn type="integer" id="S6.SS2.p3.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S6.SS2.p3.1.m1.1.1.2">50</cn><cn type="integer" id="S6.SS2.p3.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S6.SS2.p3.1.m1.1.1.3">50</cn></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S6.SS2.p3.1.m1.1c">50\times 50</annotation></semantics></math> on objects or roads within Scene 2, and generate the patch to minimize all object scores in the scene.

The third row shows the sensitivity heatmaps with selected patch areas designated in red for reference purposes. Each column represents a distinct model. Our findings demonstrate that the effect of adversarial patches on the detection capability of DeepInteraction is negligible for the patch on the road; however, the patch on the object leads to compromised detection of the patched objects. These results align with the sensitivity heatmap, where the object area shows greater intensity compared to the road area, meaning the object area is more vulnerable. Contrarily, BEVFusion-PKU is globally sensitive, as shown by the sensitivity heatmap. It is observed that patches at both locations can cause false negative detection of surrounding objects, which is consistent with the heatmap and thus validates its accuracy.</p>

Our findings reveal that the patch on road only affects the BEVFusion-PKU model, and has no significant impact on DeepInteraction, as indicated by the unchanged mAP. However, the patch on object is demonstrated to be effective for both models, 
as the detection scores for the patched objects decrease substantially in Figure <a href="#S6.F9.sf2" title="In Figure 9 ‣ 6.2 Sensitivity Distribution Recognition ‣ 6 Evaluation ‣ Fusion is Not Enough: Single-Modal Attacks to Compromise Fusion Models in Autonomous Driving" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">9(b)</span></a>.

<p id="S6.SS2.p6.1" class="ltx_p">In summary, our findings substantiate the reliability of sensitivity heatmaps as an effective metric to identify susceptible regions and determine optimal targets for adversarial patch attacks. Our study has additionally revealed that models with global sensitivity are more susceptible to such attacks since both object and non-object areas can be targeted, while only object areas can be exploited in models with object sensitivity.
Consequently, we have devised distinct attack strategies for models with different sensitivity distributions, which are described and assessed in Section <a href="#S6.SS3" title="6.3 Scene-oriented Attacks ‣ 6 Evaluation ‣ Fusion is Not Enough: Single-Modal Attacks to Compromise Fusion Models in Autonomous Driving" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">6.3</span></a> and Section <a href="#S6.SS4" title="6.4 Object-oriented Attacks ‣ 6 Evaluation ‣ Fusion is Not Enough: Single-Modal Attacks to Compromise Fusion Models in Autonomous Driving" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">6.4</span></a>.</p>

<p id="S6.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Scene-oriented attacks are primarily aimed at fusion models with global sensitivity. Such models are vulnerable to adversarial patches placed upon non-object background scenes, as evidenced in Section <a href="#S6.SS2" title="6.2 Sensitivity Distribution Recognition ‣ 6 Evaluation ‣ Fusion is Not Enough: Single-Modal Attacks to Compromise Fusion Models in Autonomous Driving" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">6.2</span></a>. In contrast to the regional patch-on-road attack that we previously assessed, scene-oriented attacks are not restricted to the per-frame level but can affect the detection of arbitrary objects in a given scene, even those that were not initially present during the patch generation. Therefore, this type of attack poses a more significant and practical threat in real-world scenarios as attackers can effortlessly paste generated adversarial patches onto the ground, rendering victim vehicles in close proximity blind. This could pose a significant risk to pedestrians and surrounding vehicles.</p>

We report the benign performance (no attack), adversarial performance (patch attack) and their difference (attack performance) for each model. Our findings indicate that the model performance of the two globally sensitive models (i.e., BEVFusion-PKU <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib48" title="" class="ltx_ref">48</a>]</cite> and BEVFusion-MIT <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib50" title="" class="ltx_ref">50</a>]</cite>) has considerably decreased, for all object categories. The mAP of their detection results decreased more than 35%. However, the other three models with object sensitivity remain unaffected.

<p id="S6.SS4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Object-oriented attacks target object-sensitive models that are more robust to attacks in non-object background areas (i.e., scene-oriented attacks). As discussed in Section <a href="#S6.SS2" title="6.2 Sensitivity Distribution Recognition ‣ 6 Evaluation ‣ Fusion is Not Enough: Single-Modal Attacks to Compromise Fusion Models in Autonomous Driving" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">6.2</span></a>, the influence of attacks on objects for object-sensitive models is more localized, as opposed to the more widespread effects in globally sensitive models. Consequently, we devise object-oriented attacks to undermine the detection of specific objects by attaching an adversarial patch. In contrast to scene-oriented attacks, where a static patch is positioned on the ground, affecting arbitrary near-by objects, object-oriented attacks concentrate their impact on a specific target object, leaving the detection of other objects unaltered. The adversarial patch moves in conjunction with the attached object. This approach offers a higher degree of customization for attackers, enabling them to manipulate the impact at the object level rather than the entire scene.</p>

The results demonstrate a substantial decrease in the target object’s detection scores, from 0.727 to 0.151 on average, thus validating the efficacy of our object-oriented adversarial attacks across all models. Furthermore, the detection results of other objects in the scene remain virtually unaffected, as evidenced by the negligible change in mAP. Consequently, object-oriented attacks can be more customized and target-specific. It is noteworthy that object-oriented attacks are effective not only for object-sensitive models but for all models, in contrast to scene-oriented attacks, which are exclusively effective for globally sensitive models.

In the viewing angle assessment, we place the patch 8 meters from the ego-vehicle and rotate it around the z-axis (i.e., the vertical axis perpendicular to the ground) from -15 degrees to 15 degrees. All other experimental settings remain consistent with Section <a href="#S6.SS3" title="6.3 Scene-oriented Attacks ‣ 6 Evaluation ‣ Fusion is Not Enough: Single-Modal Attacks to Compromise Fusion Models in Autonomous Driving" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">6.3</span></a>. The performance degradation caused by our attack is reported in Table <a href="#S6.T3" title="TABLE III ‣ 6.4 Object-oriented Attacks ‣ 6 Evaluation ‣ Fusion is Not Enough: Single-Modal Attacks to Compromise Fusion Models in Autonomous Driving" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">III</span></a> and Table <a href="#S6.T4" title="TABLE IV ‣ 6.5 Ablation Studies ‣ 6 Evaluation ‣ Fusion is Not Enough: Single-Modal Attacks to Compromise Fusion Models in Autonomous Driving" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">IV</span></a>. The first column represents various distances and viewing angles, while the second column exhibits the mean Average Precision (mAP) degradation of detection results. Subsequent columns display the average precision degradation for individual object categories. The automotive group encompasses cars, trucks, buses, and trailers. As illustrated in Table <a href="#S6.T3" title="TABLE III ‣ 6.4 Object-oriented Attacks ‣ 6 Evaluation ‣ Fusion is Not Enough: Single-Modal Attacks to Compromise Fusion Models in Autonomous Driving" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">III</span></a>, the adversarial patch demonstrates strong attack performance within the range of 7 meters to 9 meters, with diminishing effectiveness beyond 9 meters. This decrease in efficacy may be attributed to the patch appearing smaller in the camera’s field of view as the distance increases, resulting in fewer perturbed pixels and a consequent decline in attack performance. In real-world scenarios, distances less than 9 meters are practical for initiating scene-oriented attacks. For example, street paint<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite> at intersections is typically less than 9 meters to the leading vehicle. Observations from Table <a href="#S6.T4" title="TABLE IV ‣ 6.5 Ablation Studies ‣ 6 Evaluation ‣ Fusion is Not Enough: Single-Modal Attacks to Compromise Fusion Models in Autonomous Driving" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">IV</span></a> indicate that the patch maintains robust attack performance across varying angles, with optimal performance occurring at no rotation (0<sup id="S6.SS5.p1.2.2" class="ltx_sup"><span id="S6.SS5.p1.2.2.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">∘</span></sup>). Both distance and angle results reveal that attack performance is better for foreground objects (e.g., pedestrians and bicycles) situated closer to the adversarial patch and ego-vehicle.

<p id="S7.p1.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S7.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Architecture level defence.</span> Our analysis reveals that camera-LiDAR fusion models exhibit two types of sensitivity to adversarial attacks: global and object sensitivity. Globally sensitive models are more vulnerable as they are susceptible to both scene-oriented and object-oriented attacks. In contrast, object-sensitive models are more robust due to their smaller sensitive regions and resistance to non-object area attacks. Both model types, however, perform similarly in benign object detection. We investigate the architectural designs to understand the cause of different sensitivity types. We find that object-sensitive models (DeepInteraction <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib69" title="" class="ltx_ref">69</a>]</cite>, UVTR <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib47" title="" class="ltx_ref">47</a>]</cite>, and Transfusion <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>) employ ResNet50 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib40" title="" class="ltx_ref">40</a>]</cite> as their image backbone, while globally sensitive models (BEVFusion-PKU <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib48" title="" class="ltx_ref">48</a>]</cite> and BEVFusion-MIT <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib50" title="" class="ltx_ref">50</a>]</cite>) use SwinTransformer <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib49" title="" class="ltx_ref">49</a>]</cite>. To further investigate, we retrain BEVFusion-MIT <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib50" title="" class="ltx_ref">50</a>]</cite> with ResNet50 and compare the sensitivity heatmap to the original SwinTransformer model, as shown in Figure <a href="#S6.F13" title="Figure 13 ‣ 6.5 Ablation Studies ‣ 6 Evaluation ‣ Fusion is Not Enough: Single-Modal Attacks to Compromise Fusion Models in Autonomous Driving" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">13</span></a>. The results indicate that sensitive regions are more focused on objects when using ResNet50, suggesting that the image backbone significantly impacts model vulnerability. An explanation is that the CNN-based ResNet50 focuses more on local features due to its small convolutional kernels, while the transformer-based SwinTransformer captures more global information through self-attention. Consequently, adversarial patches distant from objects can still affect detection in transformer-based backbones. To enhance the model’s security against such attacks, incorporating ResNet50 as the image backbone is a preferable architectural choice.</p>

<p id="S7.p2.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S7.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">DNN level defence.</span> Despite numerous defense strategies proposed for adversarial attacks, to the best of our knowledge, none specifically target camera-LiDAR fusion models employed in 3D object detection. To assess the efficacy of our attack under various defenses, we apply five widely-used defense techniques that perform input transformations without necessitating the retraining of the victim network: JPEG compression <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>]</cite>, bit-depth reduction <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib67" title="" class="ltx_ref">67</a>]</cite>, median blurring <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib67" title="" class="ltx_ref">67</a>]</cite>, Gaussian noise addition <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib72" title="" class="ltx_ref">72</a>]</cite>, and autoencoder reformation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib51" title="" class="ltx_ref">51</a>]</cite>. Comprehensive configurations of these methods can be found in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib54" title="" class="ltx_ref">54</a>]</cite>. We execute object-oriented attacks, as detailed in Section <a href="#S6.SS4" title="6.4 Object-oriented Attacks ‣ 6 Evaluation ‣ Fusion is Not Enough: Single-Modal Attacks to Compromise Fusion Models in Autonomous Driving" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">6.4</span></a>, and implement the defense techniques on input images. Utilizing DeepInteraction <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib69" title="" class="ltx_ref">69</a>]</cite> as the fusion model, we report both the benign detection rate of the target object without attacks and the attack success rate when patches are applied. An optimal defense should simultaneously maximize the benign detection rate and minimize the attack success rate. Our results are depicted in Figure <a href="#S6.F12" title="Figure 12 ‣ 6.5 Ablation Studies ‣ 6 Evaluation ‣ Fusion is Not Enough: Single-Modal Attacks to Compromise Fusion Models in Autonomous Driving" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">12</span></a>. For each defense technique, we modify the parameters to regulate defense strength. Although the attack success rate decreases as the defense strength increases, our method consistently achieves high success rates (over 70%) across scenarios where the benign performance is not significantly impacted by the defense technique. This outcome may be attributed to the fact that the defenses primarily disrupt digital-space, human-imperceptible perturbations, and are therefore less effective against physically optimized adversarial patch attacks with unbounded perturbations <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib54" title="" class="ltx_ref">54</a>]</cite>. These findings indicate that directly applicable defense methods are insufficient in thwarting our attack without compromising benign performance. Consequently, novel adaptations of advanced defenses or the development of new defense techniques tailored to sensor fusion models are necessary, a direction we propose for future research.</p>

<p id="S7.p3.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S7.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Limitations</span> While our results demonstrate successful attacks against state-of-the-art camera-LiDAR fusion models using the camera modality, we have not conducted an end-to-end evaluation on an actual AV to illustrate the catastrophic attack outcomes (e.g., collisions or sudden stops). This limitation stems from cost and safety concerns and is shared by other studies in AV security research <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>, <a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>, <a href="#bib.bib54" title="" class="ltx_ref">54</a>]</cite>. It should be noted that the most advanced fusion models examined in this work have not yet been implemented in production-grade autonomous driving systems. Publicly available systems, such as Baidu Apollo <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite> and Autoware.ai <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>, employ integrated semantic-level fusion rather than the feature-level fusion investigated here. As a result, we did not demonstrate an end-to-end attack in simulation. However, feature-level fusion is gaining attraction in both academia <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib50" title="" class="ltx_ref">50</a>, <a href="#bib.bib48" title="" class="ltx_ref">48</a>, <a href="#bib.bib69" title="" class="ltx_ref">69</a>]</cite> and industry <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib45" title="" class="ltx_ref">45</a>]</cite>, driven by advancements in network designs and enhanced performance. Our attack is applicable to all feature-level fusion models. Furthermore, our evaluations using a real-world dataset and with industrial-grade AV sensor array underscore the practicality of our attack in real-world scenarios.</p>

<div id="S8.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S8.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We challenge the security assumption that fusion models are more robust to attacks through single modal attacks against camera-LiDAR fusion models. We leverage the affordable adversarial patch to attack the less significant camera modality in 3D object detection. The proposed optimization-based two-stage attack framework can provide a comprehensive assessment of image areas susceptible to adversarial attacks through a sensitivity heatmap, and can successfully attack five state-of-the-art camera-LiDAR fusion models on a real-world dataset with customized attack strategies. Results show that the adversarial patch generated by our attack can effectively decrease the mAP of detection performance from 0.824 to 0.353 or reduce the detection score of a target object from 0.727 to 0.151 on average.</p>

<p id="A0.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="A0.SS1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">1) Representativeness</span>: The selected models are the latest and most advanced fusion-based models for 3D object detection. Published in 2022, each model’s performance ranked top in the Nuscenes 3D object detection leaderboard <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>. Additionally, each model employs the Transformer architecture <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib61" title="" class="ltx_ref">61</a>]</cite> as the detection head, which is widely recognized as a cutting-edge design in object detection models and has been adopted in Tesla Autopilot <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>.</p>

This configuration of sensors is representative of practical autonomous driving systems and provides a more comprehensive sensing capability when compared to models that rely solely on front cameras (e.g., KITTI dataset <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">38</a>]</cite>).</p>
