<p id="id9.id1" class="ltx_p">LiDAR and camera fusion techniques are promising for achieving 3D object detection in autonomous driving. Most multi-modal 3D object detection frameworks integrate semantic knowledge from 2D images into 3D LiDAR point clouds to enhance detection accuracy. Nevertheless, the restricted resolution of 2D feature maps impedes accurate re-projection and often induces a pronounced boundary-blurring effect, which is primarily attributed to erroneous semantic segmentation. To well handle this limitation, we propose a general multi-modal fusion framework <span id="id9.id1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Multi-Sem Fusion (MSF)</span> to fuse the semantic information from both the 2D image and 3D points scene parsing results.
Specifically, we employ 2D/3D semantic segmentation methods to generate the parsing results for 2D images and 3D point clouds. The 2D semantic information is further re-projected into the 3D point clouds with calibration parameters. To handle the misalignment between the 2D and 3D parsing results, we propose an Adaptive Attention-based Fusion (AAF) module to fuse them by learning an adaptive fusion score. Then the point cloud with the fused semantic label is sent to the following 3D object detectors. Furthermore, we propose a Deep Feature Fusion (DFF) module to aggregate deep features at different levels to boost the final detection performance. The effectiveness of the framework has been verified on two public large-scale 3D object detection benchmarks by comparing them with different baselines. The experimental results show that the proposed fusion strategies can significantly improve the detection performance compared to the methods using only point clouds and the methods using only 2D semantic information. Most importantly, the proposed approach significantly outperforms other approaches and sets state-of-the-art results on the nuScenes testing benchmark.</p>

Among them, LiDAR-based 3D Object detection is the mainstream of current research. The depth information can be easily got from LiDAR sensors to localize objects. However, the texture and color information has been totally lost due to the sparse scanning. Therefore, False Positive (FP) detection and wrong categories classification often arises for LiDAR-based object detection frameworks.</p>

<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">On the other hand, images can provide details texture and color information while the depth information has been totally lost. The fusion method with various sensor data is an encouraging way for boosting the perception performance of AD. Generally, multi-modal fusion approaches in object detection tasks can be divided into early fusion-based <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>, deep fusion-based <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite> and late fusion-based approaches <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>. Early fusion-based approaches aim to create a new type of data by directly combining the raw data before inputting it into the detection framework. Typically, such methods require pixel-level correspondence between different sensor data types. Different from the early fusion-based methods, late fusion-based approaches fuse the detection results at the bounding box level. While deep fusion-based methods usually extract the features with different types of deep neural networks first and then fuse them at the features level. Currently, most multi-modal 3D object detection frameworks leverage semantic information from 2D images to improve detection accuracy in 3D LiDAR point clouds. For instance, <span id="S1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">PointPainting</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite> , a classic early fusion-based approach, takes both the point cloud and 2D image semantic predictions as input and outputs detection results, which can be utilized with any LiDAR-based 3D object detector implemented using either point cloud or voxel-based frameworks.</p>

<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">However, the blurring effect at object’s boundary often happens inevitably in image-based semantic segmentation methods. This effect becomes much worse when reprojecting the 2D semantic projections into the 3D point clouds. An example of this effect has been shown in Fig. <a href="#S1.F2" title="Figure 2 ‣ I Introduction ‣ Multi-Sem Fusion: Multimodal Semantic Fusion for 3D Object Detection" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>. Taking the big truck at the left bottom of the sub-fig, an instance of this issue is illustrated in Fig. <a href="#S1.F2" title="Figure 2 ‣ I Introduction ‣ Multi-Sem Fusion: Multimodal Semantic Fusion for 3D Object Detection" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>-(a), the significant frustum area in the blue line highlight of the background (i.e., orange points) incorrectly classified as foreground due to inaccurate projection. Additionally, the re-projection of 3D points onto 2D image pixels is not a one-to-one process because of the digital quantization and many-to-one projection issues. Notably, segmentation results from the 3D point clouds (as seen in Fig. <a href="#S1.F2" title="Figure 2 ‣ I Introduction ‣ Multi-Sem Fusion: Multimodal Semantic Fusion for 3D Object Detection" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>-(b)) outperform the 2D image at obstacle boundaries. However, the category classification from 3D point clouds often yields worse results (as demonstrated by points in red) when compared to the 2D image, primarily due to the loss of detailed texture information in point clouds.</p>

<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">The effectiveness of utilizing 2D image semantic information for 3D object detection has been demonstrated, as exemplified by PointPainting<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>, despite the presence of some semantic errors. However, a natural question arises: can the final detection performance be further improved by fusing both the 2D and 3D semantic results in an effective way? To address this question, we introduce a general multi-modal fusion framework <span id="S1.p4.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Multi-Seg Fusion</span> which fusing the multi-modal data at the semantic level to improve the final 3D object detection performance. First of all, we obtain the 2D/3D semantic information throughout 2D/3D parsing approaches by using images and raw point clouds. Then, each point has two types of semantic information after projecting point clouds onto 2D semantic images based on the intrinsic and extrinsic calibration parameters. However, the semantic results conflict usually happens for a certain point, rather than concatenating the two types of information directly, we propose an AAF strategy to fuse different types of semantic information in point or voxel-level adaptive manner. It’s achieved by the learned context features with the self-attention mechanism. Specifically, attention scores are learned for each point or voxel to balance the importance of the two different semantic results.</p>

<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Furthermore, in order to detect objects with different sizes in an efficient way, a DFF module is proposed here to fuse the features at multi-scale receptive fields and a channel attention network to gather related channel information in feature map. Then the fused features are passed for the following classification and regression heads to generate the final detection. The results on nuScenes dataset are given in Fig. <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ I Introduction ‣ Multi-Sem Fusion: Multimodal Semantic Fusion for 3D Object Detection" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a> (a), and we can obviously find that the proposed modules can robustly boost the detection performance on different baselines. The results in Fig. <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ I Introduction ‣ Multi-Sem Fusion: Multimodal Semantic Fusion for 3D Object Detection" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>(b) illustrates the contribution of each module and it can also be observed that the detection results can be consistently improved by adding more modules gradually.

The semantic information from the two types of data is then fused at the semantic level using the proposed AAF module. Furthermore, a DFF module is also proposed to fuse the deep features at different spatial levels to boost the detection for accurate kinds of size object. Finally, fused features are sent to the detection heads for producing the final detection results.

<p id="S2.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">LiDAR can provide reliable depth information while the textures information has been lost while camera sensor is just the opposite. Multi-modal 3D object detection utilizes the advantages of both structure information in point cloud and textures information in image. According to <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">39</a>]</cite>, multi-modal fusion approaches can be categorized into model-based <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib40" title="" class="ltx_ref">40</a>]</cite> and data-based methods based on the way of fusing the sensor data. Generally, model-based methods have been widely utilized for tracking <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib41" title="" class="ltx_ref">41</a>]</cite> while data-based approaches are more commonly applied to environment perception tasks like object detection <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib42" title="" class="ltx_ref">42</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib43" title="" class="ltx_ref">43</a>]</cite>. F-PointNet <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite>, PointFusion <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite> and <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib42" title="" class="ltx_ref">42</a>]</cite> generate object proposal in the 2D image first and then fuse the image features and point cloud for 3D BBox generation. PointPainting <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite> is an approach to enhance the performance of 3D point cloud object detectors by fusing semantic information from 2D images into the point cloud. In order to obtain parsing results, any SOTA approach can be used. AVOD <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>, which is a typical late fusion framework, generates features that can be shared by RPN (region proposal network) and second stage refinement network. Multi-task fusion <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib44" title="" class="ltx_ref">44</a>]</cite> has been proven to be effective in various tasks, such as jointing semantic segmentation with 3D object detection tasks as demonstrated in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>. Furthermore, Radar and HDMaps are also employed for improving the detection accuracy. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib45" title="" class="ltx_ref">45</a>]</cite> and <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib46" title="" class="ltx_ref">46</a>]</cite>, the HDMaps have been utilized as a valuable source of prior information for detecting moving objects in AD scenarios. Using the frustum-based association method, CenterFusion <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib47" title="" class="ltx_ref">47</a>]</cite> focuses on the fusion of radar and camera sensors. It associates the radar detections with objects in the image and creates radar-based feature maps to supplement the image features through a middle-fusion approach.</p>

First, the two types of information are early fused with the <span id="S3.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">PointPainting</span> technique by painting the point cloud with both the 2D and 3D semantic parsing results. To handle the inaccurate segmentation results, an AAF module is proposed to learn an attention score for different sensors for the following fusion purpose. By taking the points together with fused semantic information as inputs, deep features can be extracted from the backbone network. By considering that different size object requires different levels features, a novel DFF module is proposed to enrich features from the backbone with different levels for exploring the global context information and the local spatial details in a deep way. As illustrated in Fig. <a href="#S2.F3" title="Figure 3 ‣ II-A Single-sensor 3D Object Detection ‣ II Related Work ‣ Multi-Sem Fusion: Multimodal Semantic Fusion for 3D Object Detection" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a>, Our framework comprises three primary models: a multi-modal semantic segmentation module, an Adaptive-attention fusion (AAF) module, and a deep feature fusion (DFF) module. To obtain the semantic segmentation from both RGB images and LiDAR point clouds, we can leverage any existing 2D and 3D scene parsing approaches. Then the 2D and 3D semantic information are fused by the AAF module. Bypassing the points together with fused semantic labels into the backbone network, the DFF module is used to further improve the results by aggregating the features information within various receptive fields and a channel attention module.</p>

For acquiring 2D semantic labels, a modern semantic segmentation method is employed here for generating pixel-wise segmentation results. More importantly, the proposed framework is allowing for the use of a wide range of state-of-the-art segmentation approaches without requiring modification. This agnostic approach enables researchers and practitioners to more easily leverage their preferred segmentation models and techniques (e.g., <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib48" title="" class="ltx_ref">48</a>, <a href="#bib.bib49" title="" class="ltx_ref">49</a>, <a href="#bib.bib50" title="" class="ltx_ref">50</a>, <a href="#bib.bib51" title="" class="ltx_ref">51</a>, <a href="#bib.bib52" title="" class="ltx_ref">52</a>]</cite>, etc). We employ Deeplabv3+ <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib48" title="" class="ltx_ref">48</a>]</cite> for generating the semantic results here.

Similar to the 2D image segmentation, any SOTA 3D parsing approach can be employed here <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib53" title="" class="ltx_ref">53</a>, <a href="#bib.bib54" title="" class="ltx_ref">54</a>, <a href="#bib.bib55" title="" class="ltx_ref">55</a>]</cite>. We employ the Cylinder3D <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib56" title="" class="ltx_ref">56</a>]</cite> for generating the semantic results because of its impressive performance on the AD scenario.
More importantly, the ground truth point-wise semantic annotations can be generated from the 3D object bounding boxes roughly as <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite> while any extra semantic annotations are not necessary. Specifically, for assigning semantic labels to the 3D points, we directly assign class labels to the points inside a 3D bounding box for foreground instances, while considering points outside all the 3D bounding boxes as the background. This approach enables our proposed framework to work directly on 3D detection benchmarks without requiring additional point-wise semantic annotations. After training the network, we will obtain the parsing results which is denoted by <math id="S3.SS1.p2.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\mathbf{P}_{3D}\in\mathbb{R}^{N\times m}" display="inline"><semantics id="S3.SS1.p2.1.m1.1a"><mrow id="S3.SS1.p2.1.m1.1.1" xref="S3.SS1.p2.1.m1.1.1.cmml"><msub id="S3.SS1.p2.1.m1.1.1.2" xref="S3.SS1.p2.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml"><mi id="S3.SS1.p2.1.m1.1.1.2.2" xref="S3.SS1.p2.1.m1.1.1.2.2.cmml">𝐏</mi><mrow id="S3.SS1.p2.1.m1.1.1.2.3" xref="S3.SS1.p2.1.m1.1.1.2.3.cmml"><mn id="S3.SS1.p2.1.m1.1.1.2.3.2" xref="S3.SS1.p2.1.m1.1.1.2.3.2.cmml">3</mn><mo lspace="0em" rspace="0em" id="S3.SS1.p2.1.m1.1.1.2.3.1" xref="S3.SS1.p2.1.m1.1.1.2.3.1.cmml">​</mo><mi id="S3.SS1.p2.1.m1.1.1.2.3.3" xref="S3.SS1.p2.1.m1.1.1.2.3.3.cmml">D</mi></mrow></msub><mo id="S3.SS1.p2.1.m1.1.1.1" xref="S3.SS1.p2.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml">∈</mo><msup id="S3.SS1.p2.1.m1.1.1.3" xref="S3.SS1.p2.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml"><mi id="S3.SS1.p2.1.m1.1.1.3.2" xref="S3.SS1.p2.1.m1.1.1.3.2.cmml">ℝ</mi><mrow id="S3.SS1.p2.1.m1.1.1.3.3" xref="S3.SS1.p2.1.m1.1.1.3.3.cmml"><mi id="S3.SS1.p2.1.m1.1.1.3.3.2" xref="S3.SS1.p2.1.m1.1.1.3.3.2.cmml">N</mi><mo lspace="0.222em" rspace="0.222em" id="S3.SS1.p2.1.m1.1.1.3.3.1" xref="S3.SS1.p2.1.m1.1.1.3.3.1.cmml">×</mo><mi id="S3.SS1.p2.1.m1.1.1.3.3.3" xref="S3.SS1.p2.1.m1.1.1.3.3.3.cmml">m</mi></mrow></msup></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S3.SS1.p2.1.m1.1b"><apply id="S3.SS1.p2.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS1.p2.1.m1.1.1"><in id="S3.SS1.p2.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS1.p2.1.m1.1.1.1"></in><apply id="S3.SS1.p2.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S3.SS1.p2.1.m1.1.1.2"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S3.SS1.p2.1.m1.1.1.2.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS1.p2.1.m1.1.1.2">subscript</csymbol><ci id="S3.SS1.p2.1.m1.1.1.2.2.cmml" xref="S3.SS1.p2.1.m1.1.1.2.2">𝐏</ci><apply id="S3.SS1.p2.1.m1.1.1.2.3.cmml" xref="S3.SS1.p2.1.m1.1.1.2.3"><times id="S3.SS1.p2.1.m1.1.1.2.3.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS1.p2.1.m1.1.1.2.3.1"></times><cn type="integer" id="S3.SS1.p2.1.m1.1.1.2.3.2.cmml" xref="S3.SS1.p2.1.m1.1.1.2.3.2">3</cn><ci id="S3.SS1.p2.1.m1.1.1.2.3.3.cmml" xref="S3.SS1.p2.1.m1.1.1.2.3.3">𝐷</ci></apply></apply><apply id="S3.SS1.p2.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S3.SS1.p2.1.m1.1.1.3"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S3.SS1.p2.1.m1.1.1.3.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS1.p2.1.m1.1.1.3">superscript</csymbol><ci id="S3.SS1.p2.1.m1.1.1.3.2.cmml" xref="S3.SS1.p2.1.m1.1.1.3.2">ℝ</ci><apply id="S3.SS1.p2.1.m1.1.1.3.3.cmml" xref="S3.SS1.p2.1.m1.1.1.3.3"><times id="S3.SS1.p2.1.m1.1.1.3.3.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS1.p2.1.m1.1.1.3.3.1"></times><ci id="S3.SS1.p2.1.m1.1.1.3.3.2.cmml" xref="S3.SS1.p2.1.m1.1.1.3.3.2">𝑁</ci><ci id="S3.SS1.p2.1.m1.1.1.3.3.3.cmml" xref="S3.SS1.p2.1.m1.1.1.3.3.3">𝑚</ci></apply></apply></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S3.SS1.p2.1.m1.1c">\mathbf{P}_{3D}\in\mathbb{R}^{N\times m}</annotation></semantics></math>.</p>

Therefore, the point clouds with 2D semantic segmentation usually has misclassified regions around the objects’ boundary. For example, the frustum region is illustrated in the sub-fig. <a href="#S1.F2" title="Figure 2 ‣ I Introduction ‣ Multi-Sem Fusion: Multimodal Semantic Fusion for 3D Object Detection" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a> (a) behind the big truck has been totally misclassified. On the contrary, the parsing results from the 3D point clouds usually perform a clear and accurate object boundary without blurring effect e.g., sub-fig. <a href="#S1.F2" title="Figure 2 ‣ I Introduction ‣ Multi-Sem Fusion: Multimodal Semantic Fusion for 3D Object Detection" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>(b). However, the disadvantages of the 3D segmentor are also obvious. One drawback is that without the color and texture information, the 3D segmentor is difficult to distinguish these categories with similar shapes from the point cloud-only. In order to boost advantages while suppressing disadvantages, an AAF module has been proposed to adaptively combine the 2D/3D semantic segmentation results. Then the Optimized semantic information is ready for the following 3D object detectors backbone to further extract the enhanced feature to improve the final object detection accuracy results.</p>

represent point coordinates, predicted 2D and 3D semantic segmentation results vector respectively. To ensure consistency across voxels, we utilize a sampling technique to maintain a fixed number of points in each voxel.
Subsequently, we utilize local and global feature aggregation techniques to calculate attention weights for each voxel, which help to determine the relative importance of 2D and 3D semantic segmentation labels. In other words, the AFF module chooses which category of 2D/3D semantic information should be trusted in the voxel.</p>

<p id="S3.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In AD scenarios, determining the identity and location of objects is crucial for the subsequent planning and control modules. Therefore, it is not only necessary to recognize what objects are present, but also where they are located. In typical object detection frameworks, they correspond to the classification and regression branches respectively. Empirically, global context information is important to recognize the specific class attributes. On the contrary, the object’s attributes (e.g., dimension, orientation, and precise location, etc) regression branch prioritize the capture of detailed spatial information around the ROI (region of interest) in a relatively small range. For accurate kinds of size object detection, therefore various scales receptive fields are necessary. This issue has been considered in most object detection frameworks. However, how to use various fields of view fields in an efficient way is vitally important.</p>

<p id="S4.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S4.SS1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">KITTI</span> is one of the most popular benchmarks for 3D object detection in AD, which contains 7481 samples for training and 7518 samples for testing. The objects in each class are divided into three difficulty levels as “easy”, “moderate”, and “hard”, according to the object size, the occlusion ratio, and the truncation level. Since the ground truth annotations of the test samples are not available and the access to the test server is limited, we follow the idea in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib43" title="" class="ltx_ref">43</a>]</cite> and split the training data into “train” and “val” where each set contains 3712 and 3769 samples respectively. In this dataset, both the LiDAR point clouds and the RGB images have been provided. In addition, both the intrinsic parameters and extrinsic parameters between different sensors have been given.</p>

Specifically, before the publication of <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib60" title="" class="ltx_ref">60</a>]</cite>, the KITTI official benchmark used the 11 recall positions for comparison. After that, the official benchmark changes the evaluation criterion from 11-points to 40-points because the latter one is proved to be more stable than the former <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib60" title="" class="ltx_ref">60</a>]</cite>. Therefore, we use the 40-points criterion for all the experiments here. In addition, similar to <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>, the average AP (mAP) of three Classes for “Moderate” is also taken as an indicator for evaluating the average performance on all three classes.</p>

From the table, we can clearly see that remarkable improvements have been achieved on the three baselines across all the categories.
Taking Pointpillars as an example, the proposed method has achieved 0.43%, 6.65%, 1.55% points improvements on “Car”, “Pedestrian” and “Cyclist” respectively. Interestingly, compared to “Car”, “Pedestrian” and “Cyclist” give much more improvements by the fusion painting modules.

Objects are annotated in the LiDAR coordinate and projected into different sensors’ coordinates with pre-calibrated intrinsic and extrinsic parameters. For the point clouds stream, only the keyframes (2fps) are annotated. With a 32 lines LiDAR scanner, each frame contains about 300,000 points for 360-degree viewpoint. For the object detection task, the obstacles have been categorized into 10 classes as “car”, “truck”, “bicycle” and “pedestrian” etc. Besides the point clouds, the corresponding RGB images are also provided for each keyframe, and for each keyframe, there are 6 cameras that can cover 360 fields of view.</p>

Different from the original mAP defined in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib72" title="" class="ltx_ref">72</a>]</cite>, nuScenes consider the BEV center distance with thresholds of {0.5, 1, 2, 4} meters, instead of the IoUs of bounding boxes. NDS is a weighted sum of mAP and other metric scores, such as average translation error (ATE) and average scale error (ASE).

The proposed framework has been evaluated on nuScenes benchmark for both “val” and “test” splits. The results of comparison with three baselines are given in Tab. <a href="#S4.T3" title="TABLE III ‣ IV-A Evaluation on KITTI Dataset ‣ IV Experimental Results ‣ Multi-Sem Fusion: Multimodal Semantic Fusion for 3D Object Detection" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">III</span></a>.

For the <span id="S4.SS2.p6.5.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">PointPillars</span>, the proposed module gives <span id="S4.SS2.p6.5.5" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">8.93</span> and <span id="S4.SS2.p6.5.6" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">18.29</span> points improvements on <span id="S4.SS2.p6.5.7" class="ltx_text ltx_markedasmath">NDS</span> and <span id="S4.SS2.p6.5.8" class="ltx_text ltx_markedasmath">mAP</span> respectively. For <span id="S4.SS2.p6.5.9" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">SECOND</span>, the two values are <span id="S4.SS2.p6.5.10" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">5.65</span> and <span id="S4.SS2.p6.5.11" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">11.76</span> respectively. Even for the strong baseline <span id="S4.SS2.p6.5.12" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">CenterPoint</span>, the proposed module can also give <span id="S4.SS2.p6.5.13" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">5.09</span> and <span id="S4.SS2.p6.5.14" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">9.32</span> points improvements.
In addition, we also find that the categories which share small sizes such as “Traffic Cone”, “Moto” and “Bicycle” have received more improvements compared to other categories. Taking “Bicycle” as an example, the <span id="S4.SS2.p6.5.15" class="ltx_text ltx_markedasmath">mAP</span> has been improved by 36.46%, 49.41% and 26.49% compared to <span id="S4.SS2.p6.5.16" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">SECOND</span>, <span id="S4.SS2.p6.5.17" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">PointPillar</span> and <span id="S4.SS2.p6.5.18" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Centerpoint</span> respectively. This phenomenon can be explained as these categories with small sizes are hard to be recognized in point clouds because of a few LiDAR points on them. In this case, the semantic information from the 2D/3D parsing results is extremely helpful for improving 3D object detection performance. It should be emphasized that the result in Tab. <a href="#S4.T3" title="TABLE III ‣ IV-A Evaluation on KITTI Dataset ‣ IV Experimental Results ‣ Multi-Sem Fusion: Multimodal Semantic Fusion for 3D Object Detection" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">III</span></a> without any Test Time Augmentation(TTA) strategies.</p>

Three different representations as “Semantic ID”, “Onehot Vector” and “Semantic Score” are considered here. For “Semantic ID”, the digital class ID is used directly and for the “Semantic Score”, the predicted probability after the Softmax operation is used. In addition, to convert the semantic scores to a “Onehot Vector”, we assign the class with the highest score as “1” and keep other classes as “0”. Here, we just add the semantic feature to the original <math id="S4.SS3.p2.1.m1.3" class="ltx_Math" alttext="(x,y,z)" display="inline"><semantics id="S4.SS3.p2.1.m1.3a"><mrow id="S4.SS3.p2.1.m1.3.4.2" xref="S4.SS3.p2.1.m1.3.4.1.cmml"><mo stretchy="false" id="S4.SS3.p2.1.m1.3.4.2.1" xref="S4.SS3.p2.1.m1.3.4.1.cmml">(</mo><mi id="S4.SS3.p2.1.m1.1.1" xref="S4.SS3.p2.1.m1.1.1.cmml">x</mi><mo id="S4.SS3.p2.1.m1.3.4.2.2" xref="S4.SS3.p2.1.m1.3.4.1.cmml">,</mo><mi id="S4.SS3.p2.1.m1.2.2" xref="S4.SS3.p2.1.m1.2.2.cmml">y</mi><mo id="S4.SS3.p2.1.m1.3.4.2.3" xref="S4.SS3.p2.1.m1.3.4.1.cmml">,</mo><mi id="S4.SS3.p2.1.m1.3.3" xref="S4.SS3.p2.1.m1.3.3.cmml">z</mi><mo stretchy="false" id="S4.SS3.p2.1.m1.3.4.2.4" xref="S4.SS3.p2.1.m1.3.4.1.cmml">)</mo></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S4.SS3.p2.1.m1.3b"><vector id="S4.SS3.p2.1.m1.3.4.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS3.p2.1.m1.3.4.2"><ci id="S4.SS3.p2.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS3.p2.1.m1.1.1">𝑥</ci><ci id="S4.SS3.p2.1.m1.2.2.cmml" xref="S4.SS3.p2.1.m1.2.2">𝑦</ci><ci id="S4.SS3.p2.1.m1.3.3.cmml" xref="S4.SS3.p2.1.m1.3.3">𝑧</ci></vector></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S4.SS3.p2.1.m1.3c">(x,y,z)</annotation></semantics></math> coordinates with concatenation operation and <span id="S4.SS3.p2.3.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">PointPillars</span> is taken as the baseline on nuScenes dataset due to its efficiency of model iteration.

More specifically, the “Semantic Score” achieves the best performance among the three which gives 9.64 and 4.70 points improvements for <span id="S4.SS3.p2.3.3" class="ltx_text ltx_markedasmath ltx_font_bold">mAP</span> and <span id="S4.SS3.p2.3.4" class="ltx_text ltx_markedasmath ltx_font_bold">NDS</span> respectively.

From the table, we can obviously find that all the modules give positive effects on all three categories for the final detection results. For all the categories, the proposed modules give 2.9 points improvements averagely and “Pedestrian” achieves the most gain which achieves 3.45 points. Furthermore, we find that deep fusion gives the most improvements compared to the other three modules in this dataset.</p>

To be clear, a boosted version of baseline is presented here than in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite> by fixing the sync-bn issue in the source code.
From this table, we can see that both the 2D and 3D semantic information can significantly boost the performances while the 2D information provide more improvements than the 3D information. This phenomenon can be explained as that the 2D texture information can highly benefit the categories classification results which is very important for the final <span id="S4.SS3.p5.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">mAP</span> computation. In addition, by giving the 2D information, the recall ability can be improved especially for objects in long distance with a few scanned points. In other words, the advantage for 3D semantic information is that the point clouds can well handle the occlusion among objects which are very common in AD scenarios which is hard to deal with in 2D. After fusion, all the detectors achieve much better performances than only one semantic information (2D or 3D).</p>

<p id="S4.SS4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Besides the performance, the computation time is also very important. Here, we test the computation time of each module based on the <span id="S4.SS4.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">PointPillars</span> and <span id="S4.SS4.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">SECOND</span> on the KITTI dataset in Tab. <a href="#S4.T9" title="TABLE IX ‣ IV-C Ablation Studies ‣ IV Experimental Results ‣ Multi-Sem Fusion: Multimodal Semantic Fusion for 3D Object Detection" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">IX</span></a>. For a single Nvidia V100 GPU, the <span id="S4.SS4.p1.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">PointPillars</span> takes 53.5 ms per frame. By adding the 2D and 3D semantic information, the inference time increases 3.0 ms and 3.4 ms respectively while the time increases about 9 ms by adding two types semantic information and the AFF &amp; DFF modules. The inference time for <span id="S4.SS4.p1.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">SECOND</span> is given at the right column of Tab. <a href="#S4.T9" title="TABLE IX ‣ IV-C Ablation Studies ‣ IV Experimental Results ‣ Multi-Sem Fusion: Multimodal Semantic Fusion for 3D Object Detection" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">IX</span></a>. Compared with the baseline, the 2D/3D semantic segmentation information gives nearly no extra computational burden. We explain this phenomenon as that in <span id="S4.SS4.p1.1.5" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">SECOND</span> the simple <span id="S4.SS4.p1.1.6" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">mean</span> operation is employed for extracting the features for each voxel and the computation time of this operation will not change too much with the increasing of the feature dimension. For <span id="S4.SS4.p1.1.7" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">PointPillars</span>, the MPL is employed for feature extracting in each pillar, therefore the computation time will increase largely with the increasing of the feature dimension.</p>
</div>
<div id="S4.SS4.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS4.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In addition, we also record the time used for obtaining the 2D/3D semantic results. For Deeplab V3+, the inference time is about 32 ms per frame while for Cylinder3D, it takes about 140 ms per frame. Furthermore, the re-projection of 2D image to 3D point clouds also takes about 3 ms for each frame. The almost time consuming here are 2D/3D point clouds segmentation operations. But in the practical using there just need a extra segmentation head after detection network backbone. In other words, multi-head is needed here for both detection and segmentation task. These just taking few milliseconds when using model inference acceleration operation, like C++ inference library TensorRT.

From these figures, we can easily find that there is some false positive detection caused by the frustum blurring effect in 2D painting, while the 3D semantic results give a relatively clear boundary of the object but provides some worse class classification. More importantly, the proposed framework which combines both the two complementary information from 2D and 3D segmentation can give much more accurate detection results.</p>

<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this work, we proposed an effective framework <span id="S5.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Multi-Sem Fusion</span> to fuse the RGB image and LiDAR point clouds in two different levels. For the first level, the proposed AAF module aggregates the semantic information from both the 2D image and 3D point clouds segmentation, resulting in adaptivity with learned weight scores. For the second level, a DFF module is proposed to fuse further the boosted feature maps with different receptive fields by channel attention module. Thus, the features can cover objects of different sizes. More importantly, the proposed modules are detector independent, which can be seamlessly employed in different frameworks. The effectiveness of the proposed framework has been evaluated on public benchmark and outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches. However, the limitation of the current framework is also obvious. Both the 2D and 3D parsing results are obtained by offline approaches, which prevent the application of our approach in real-time AD scenarios. An interesting research direction is sharing the backbone features for object detection and segmentation and taking the segmentation as an auxiliary task.</p>
