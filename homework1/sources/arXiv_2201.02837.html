<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we propose mushrooms detection, localization and 3D pose estimation algorithm using RGB-D data acquired from a low-cost consumer RGB-D sensor. We use the RGB and depth information for different purposes. From RGB color, we first extract initial contour locations of the mushrooms and then provide both the initial contour locations and the original image to active contour for mushrooms segmentation. These segmented mushrooms are then used as input to a circular Hough transform for each mushroom detection including its center and radius. Once each mushroom’s center position in the RGB image is known, we then use the depth information to locate it in 3D space i.e. in world coordinate system. In case of missing depth information at the detected center of each mushroom, we estimate from the nearest available depth information within the radius of each mushroom. We also estimate the 3D pose of each mushroom using a pre-prepared upright mushroom model. We use a global registration followed by local refine registration approach for this 3D pose estimation. From the estimated 3D pose, we use only the rotation part expressed in quaternion as an orientation of each mushroom. These estimated (X,Y,Z) positions, diameters and orientations of the mushrooms are used for robotic-picking applications. We carry out extensive experiments on both 3D printed and real mushrooms which show that our method has an interesting performance.</p>

<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Harvesting of fruits and vegetables such as grapes, mangoes, apples, kiwifruit, peaches, citrus, cherries, pears and mushrooms is highly labor intensive and poses human risk, for instance, ladder-related injuries that require a significant amount payment for compensation. It is also becoming less sustainable with increasing cost and decreasing availability of a skilled labor force. For instance, the £120m UK mushroom industry is facing challenges from reduced labour availability due to changes in demographics i.e. fewer younger people are entering the agricultural community whilst global food demand is ever expanding, and changes in national inward migration policies that may impact labour availability. Picking labour currently accounts for about 1/3 of production costs. To meet the increasing labor demand, to lower human risk of injuries, and to decrease the harvesting cost, automated harvesting system is crucial.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Many researchers and private companies have attempted to develop fully automated robotic system for harvesting of fruits and vegetables, however, no commercialized robotic harvester is available yet i.e. the need to develop robotic approaches to pick fresh fruits and vegetables is global. To develop a robotic harvester, the accuracy of detection, localization and 3D pose (rotation and translation) of fruits and vegetables is very important <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite><cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>. However, there are many challenges to develop accurate detection, localization and 3D pose estimation algorithms such as changing illuminations, severe occlusions, various sizes and textures of fruits and vegetables, highly unstructured scenes, etc. Furthermore, these challenges cause robotic harvesting to be developed for specific data and designed for the task at hand.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">There are some previous works of applying computer vision techniques for agriculture (agrovision) as reviewed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite><cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. Some segmentation techniques for fruit detection are discussed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>, and some works are particularly tuned for a specific type of fruits such as grapes, mangoes, apples, kiwifruit, peaches, etc. Fruit detection, tracking, and 3D reconstruction for crop mapping and yield estimation was developed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>. These all previous works have focused mainly on 2D images. The recent introduction of cheap RGB-D sensors have opened a new door for computer vision researchers for many real applications. RGB-D sensors combine RGB color information with per-pixel depth information. Though sensors such as the Swiss Ranger SR4000 and Photonic Mixing Device (PMD) Tech products which can provide such data have existed for years, they are very costly. However, new consumer RGB-D sensors such as Kinect, Intel RealSense and Zed stereo camera are very cheap when compared to the aforementioned sensors. The applications and the challenges of Kinect sensor, particularly Kinect version 1 was explained in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>. Both Kinect version 1 and 2 send out infrared laser light in order to measure the depth. The Kinect version 1 uses the structured-light-method to measure the depth with Pattern Projection principle. In this case, a known infrared (IR) pattern is projected into the scene and the depth is computed out of its distortion. However, the Kinect version 2 uses the Time-of-Flight (ToF) method and determines the depth by measuring the time the emitted light takes from ToF camera to the object and return. The Kinect version 2 provides more accurate depth information than the older version <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite><cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>. For obtaining depth information from the Kinect version 2, measurable distance range is from 0.5m to 4m <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>. More importantly the depth accuracy of Kinect version 2 is almost constant over different distances <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>. However, it is recommended to pre-heat the device for at least 25 min to obtain reliable results <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>. The ZED Stereo Camera, a depth sensor based on passive stereovision, observes objects from 0.5 to 20m. Intel RealSense cameras, both SR300 and D435, use infrared depth-sensing technology. D435 use active stereo infrared technology, which means the device has two infrared cameras as opposed to a single one on the SR300. SR300 is a short-range sensor (hence the model name) using coded-light method like Kinect version 1 whereas D435 is a longer-range sensor with a larger field of view as it uses depth stereo. The measurable distance range for SR300 is 0.2m - 1.5m whereas for D435 is 0.11m - 10m. The maximum range of D435 varies depending on calibration, scene, lighting condition, etc. The emergence of these low-cost RGB-D sensors motivated many computer vision researchers to use them for many applications such as object recognition <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite><cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>, object detection <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>, pose estimation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite><cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite><cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>, 3D reconstruction <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>, simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>, etc.</p>

<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">However, to the best of our knowledge, only the work in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite> gave attention to the application of computer vision for mushrooms harvesting. This work focused on a specific mushroom type, brown colour, and developed segmentation algorithm based on K-means. Though a good start, it has many limitations, for instance, the number of clusters needs to be predefined and the colour of the mushrooms to be applied to needs to be known in advance. It also did not include on any work on 3D pose estimation of the mushrooms. Our work takes one step forward by removing any prior knowledge about the mushrooms colour, illumination, etc as well as estimating depth information even if it is missing due to the inherent problems of the RGB-D sensors such as noise and holes. Basically the goal is to discriminate the mushrooms from the rest of the scene, to detect the presence of individual mushrooms, to localise them in space, and to estimate their 3D pose.</p>

<div id="S3.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">For mushrooms segmentation, we use an active contour method developed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>, a type of active contour or snake usually known as Chan-Vase method. Basically active contour evolves the segmentation, splitting the image into foreground (object) and background regions, using an iterative process. This Chan-Vase method can segment objects whose boundaries are not necessarily defined by gradient or with very smooth boundaries. Starting from the initial contour location (from where the evolution starts) which can be anywhere in the image and not necessarily surround the objects of interest, this method can automatically segment the objects, in our case mushrooms. We use automatic thresholding to define the mask which is a binary image that specifies the initial state of the active contour. As shown in Fig. <a href="#S2.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 2 Overview of our Proposed Method ‣ Mushrooms Detection, Localization and 3D Pose Estimation using RGB-D Sensor for Robotic-picking Applications" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>, we use both RGB and graycale images independently as input to the active contour and we found that active contour works better when using grayscale image than the RGB image with a specified mask.</p>

A global minimizer can be obtained, independently of the position of the initial curve, which allows to automatically detect interior contours. This minimization problem could also be solved numerically, using a similar finite differences scheme. The good advantage of this model is that it is not dependent on an edge-function to stop the evolving curve on the desired boundary i.e. we can detect objects whose boundaries are not necessarily defined by gradient or with very smooth boundaries. It is also possible automatically detect interior contours starting with only one initial curve. The position of the initial curve can be anywhere in the image, and it does not necessarily surround the objects to be detected.</p>

<p id="S4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">There are many features such as color, geometric, texture or their combination that can be used in machine vision for fruits and vegetables detection. Geometric measures such as shape and size provide a good set of distinct features of fruits and vegetables. In our case, the shape of mushrooms, particularly mushrooms caps which are circles, gives a good discriminative feature to use for their detection. Accordingly, we apply a Circular Hough Transform (CHT) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>, which can detect circles of varying size, to the segmented (binary) image for mushrooms caps detection. We first apply opening morphological operation with elliptical structuring element (kernel) of (10,10) on the segmented images to remove small objects (noise) and then apply CHT for detection of the mushrooms. Given a radius range [Rmin, Rmax], the CHT algorithm detects the mushrooms centers and radii of varying size in the image.</p>

To locate the mushrooms centers in 3D space, we use the depth information from the Intel RealSense SR300 due to its short-range sensing capability which fits well for our application (mushrooms needs to be sensed in less than 20cm distance between mushroom beds). In our experiment, SR300 gives much higher point cloud quality than the D435.

<div id="S6.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The orientation estimation of each mushroom is also important for successful picking without harming it. Therefore, we propose a 3D pose (rotation and translation) estimation algorithm based on matching or registration of point clouds of a model with a sample (an interested mushroom). We prepare one model particularly upright mushroom model. We propose a method based on global registration followed by local registration. We use Open3D for our implementation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>.</p>

<div id="S6.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">This registration method is used to estimate a rough alignment of two point clouds (model and sample) using sparse correspondences. Basically the dense point clouds are first downsampled and then 3D geometric descriptors are extracted from these downsampled (subsampled) point clouds. We use Fast Point Feature Histograms (FPFH) as the 3D geometric descriptors <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>. The FPFH feature is a 33-dimensional vector that describes the local geometric property of a point. Sparse correspondences are computed using the 3D geometric descriptors and a rough alignment of these point clouds are estimated using either sampling-based global registration methods such as RANSAC <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite> or a single objective function optimization based global registration methods <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>; the latter is used in our case as it is faster.</p>

<p id="S6.SS2.p1.2" class="ltx_p">Local registration is used as a local refinement by beginning with a rough initial alignment (obtained from the global registration stage). This produces a tight registration based on the original undownsampled point clouds i.e. while global registration methods operate on sparse candidate correspondences using 3D geometric descriptors, local registration methods operate on dense correspondences. We use Iterative Closest Point (ICP) algorithm <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite> for the local refinement stage. Even though the two variants <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite>, point-to-point and point-to-plane based ICP local registration, work well in our experiment, we use the point-to-point method for our evaluation.

This algorithm also shows similar performance on real mushrooms obtained from a mushroom farm as shown in Fig. <a href="#S7.F5" title="Figure 5 ‣ 7 Experimental Results ‣ Mushrooms Detection, Localization and 3D Pose Estimation using RGB-D Sensor for Robotic-picking Applications" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5</span></a>, Fig. <a href="#S7.F6" title="Figure 6 ‣ 7 Experimental Results ‣ Mushrooms Detection, Localization and 3D Pose Estimation using RGB-D Sensor for Robotic-picking Applications" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">6</span></a> and Fig. <a href="#S7.F7" title="Figure 7 ‣ 7 Experimental Results ‣ Mushrooms Detection, Localization and 3D Pose Estimation using RGB-D Sensor for Robotic-picking Applications" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">7</span></a>. The method detects almost all mushrooms of varying size.</p>

<p id="S7.p2.3" class="ltx_p">We use recall and precision for quantitative evaluations of the mushroom detection algorithm on the real mushrooms. Recall (also called sensitivity, true positive rate, or probability of detection) measures the proportion of the mushrooms that are correctly detected. On the other hand, precision (also called the positive predictive value) measures the proportion of actual positives (correctly detected mushrooms) in the data. They are formulated as</p>

This radius range was set empirically for our dataset; no mushroom with radius greater than 38 pixels was observed in the given images i.e. we set the maximum radius so that the algorithm can detect the biggest mushroom available. The mushrooms smaller than 8 pixels are uninterested ones (in our case) and are treated as true negatives.</p>

<p id="S7.p9.1" class="ltx_p">We also evaluate quantitatively the performance of the depth measurement of the Intel RealSense SR300. We determine the ground truth depth values by physically measuring the perpendicular distance from the perpendicularly downward facing Intel RealSense SR300 to the planar surface. The depth accuracy is the difference between the true depth value and the average value of the measured depth values corresponding to a planar surface located in front of the SR300.

<p id="S7.p12.1" class="ltx_p">The localization of each mushroom center in 3D space is also shown in Fig. <a href="#S7.F8" title="Figure 8 ‣ 7 Experimental Results ‣ Mushrooms Detection, Localization and 3D Pose Estimation using RGB-D Sensor for Robotic-picking Applications" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">8</span></a>. The direct depth reading from the Intel RealSense is shown in Fig. <a href="#S7.F8.sf1" title="In Figure 8 ‣ 7 Experimental Results ‣ Mushrooms Detection, Localization and 3D Pose Estimation using RGB-D Sensor for Robotic-picking Applications" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">8a</span></a>. As can be observed from this figure, ’NaN’ is displayed for showing missing of depth information. Though depth information is obtained for many mushrooms centers in this experiment, depth information can sometimes be missing for some mushrooms centers. In this experiment, depth information is missing for one mushroom center as shown in Fig. <a href="#S7.F8.sf1" title="In Figure 8 ‣ 7 Experimental Results ‣ Mushrooms Detection, Localization and 3D Pose Estimation using RGB-D Sensor for Robotic-picking Applications" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">8a</span></a>. We then estimate the 3D location of the mushroom center from the nearest available depth information. We take the average of the nearest available (X,Y,Z) positions which are obtained from nearest available depth information with the constraint that this nearest available depth information must be located within the radius of each mushroom. In this experiment, the nearest depth information is obtained within a few pixels distance from the center of the mushroom. We take the average of the nearest available depth information for better accuracy i.e. robust to noise. Accordingly, we only display the depth (Z) in blue and the distance (d) in red; we did not display the other coordinates (X and Y) for clarity. We show both (X,Y,Z) position and distance (d) from the depth sensor to the center of the mushroom for one sample as a typical example in Fig. <a href="#S7.F8.sf2" title="In Figure 8 ‣ 7 Experimental Results ‣ Mushrooms Detection, Localization and 3D Pose Estimation using RGB-D Sensor for Robotic-picking Applications" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">8b</span></a>. The depth accuracy of the mushrooms caps is in agreement with the depth accuracy given in Table <a href="#S7.T1" title="Table 1 ‣ 7 Experimental Results ‣ Mushrooms Detection, Localization and 3D Pose Estimation using RGB-D Sensor for Robotic-picking Applications" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>. We measure the ground truth depth values of about 20 mushrooms caps and compare with their corresponding measured depth values; the mean accuracy (offset) obtained is about -2.77mm. The Intel RealSense camera can sense nearer objects than the other RGB-D sensors as shown in Fig. <a href="#S7.F9" title="Figure 9 ‣ 7 Experimental Results ‣ Mushrooms Detection, Localization and 3D Pose Estimation using RGB-D Sensor for Robotic-picking Applications" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">9</span></a>; this is the reason we choose this sensor for our application. As can be seen from Fig. <a href="#S7.F4" title="Figure 4 ‣ 7 Experimental Results ‣ Mushrooms Detection, Localization and 3D Pose Estimation using RGB-D Sensor for Robotic-picking Applications" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a> and Fig. <a href="#S7.F8" title="Figure 8 ‣ 7 Experimental Results ‣ Mushrooms Detection, Localization and 3D Pose Estimation using RGB-D Sensor for Robotic-picking Applications" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">8</span></a>, the detection algorithm performs well on 3D printed mushrooms with recall and precision of unity.</p>

We use both row and column of the circles in images and then compute the diameter in the world coordinate system by taking average of them to make robust to outliers. In case of missing depth information on the sides of the mushrooms, we estimate from the nearest available depth information. We then compare the computed diameter of each mushroom with the ground truth mushroom diameters which we measure physically in millimeters. The average offset of the estimated diameters from the true values is about -2.0mm. The computed diameters are shown in Fig. <a href="#S7.F10" title="Figure 10 ‣ 7 Experimental Results ‣ Mushrooms Detection, Localization and 3D Pose Estimation using RGB-D Sensor for Robotic-picking Applications" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">10</span></a> which corresponds to the images in Fig. <a href="#S7.F8" title="Figure 8 ‣ 7 Experimental Results ‣ Mushrooms Detection, Localization and 3D Pose Estimation using RGB-D Sensor for Robotic-picking Applications" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">8</span></a>.

The average angle difference between the ground truth and estimated normal orientation vectors of mushrooms is about 13.5 degrees with standard deviation of 7.5 evaluated over about 30 samples with varying angles. This is reasonable for successful mushrooms picking given the difficulty of the mushrooms orientation estimation due to their small size and textureless nature. We now have all the required parameters (X, Y, Z, Diameter, Quaternion) which will be given as input to the robot for mushrooms picking applications.</p>

<div id="S8.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S8.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We have developed mushrooms detection, localization and 3D pose estimation algorithm using RGB-D data acquired from a low-cost consumer RGB-D sensor. We use RGB part (converting to grayscale for better performance) for mushrooms segmentation using active contour and detection using a circular Hough transform. Once each mushroom’s center position in the RGB image is known, we then use the depth information to locate it in 3D space. In case of missing depth information at the detected center of each mushroom, we estimate from the nearest available depth information within the radius of each mushroom. We estimate the 3D pose of each mushrooms using a global registration followed by a local refine registration approach. The parameters of the mushrooms are used for robotic-picking applications. We observe that our algorithm has an interesting performance on both 3D printed mushrooms in Lab and real mushrooms from a farm in all detection, localization and orientation estimation (from the estimated 3D pose). Fusing subsequent point clouds may improve the localization and 3D pose estimation of mushrooms which can fill some holes (missing depth values) at the expense of more computational cost. Using more accurate 3D sensor such as a laser may also improve the result.</p>
