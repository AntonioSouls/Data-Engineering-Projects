<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">A Flying Bird Object Detection algorithm Based on Motion Information (FBOD-BMI) is proposed to solve the problem that the features of the object are not obvious in a single frame, and the size of the object is small (low Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR)) in surveillance video. Firstly, a ConvLSTM-PAN model structure is designed to capture suspicious flying bird objects, in which the Convolutional Long and Short Time Memory (ConvLSTM) network aggregated the Spatio-temporal features of the flying bird object on adjacent multi-frame before the input of the model and the Path Aggregation Network (PAN) located the suspicious flying bird objects. Then, an object tracking algorithm is used to track suspicious flying bird objects and calculate their Motion Range (MR). At the same time, the size of the MR of the suspicious flying bird object is adjusted adaptively according to its speed of movement (specifically, if the bird moves slowly, its MR will be expanded according to the speed of the bird to ensure the environmental information needed to detect the flying bird object). Adaptive Spatio-temporal Cubes (ASt-Cubes) of the flying bird objects are generated to ensure that the SNR of the flying bird objects is improved, and the necessary environmental information is retained adaptively. Finally, a LightWeight U-Shape Net (LW-USN) based on ASt-Cubes is designed to detect flying bird objects, which rejects the false detections of the suspicious flying bird objects and returns the position of the real flying bird objects. The monitoring video including the flying birds is collected in the unattended traction substation as the experimental dataset to verify the performance of the algorithm. The experimental results show that the flying bird object detection method based on motion information proposed in this paper can effectively detect the flying bird object in surveillance video.</p>

These methods mainly detect objects in still images and rely on the appearance features of the objects. However, the appearance characteristics of flying bird objects are not particularly obvious in surveillance videos, so the object detection method based on still images is ineffective when applied to our task.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">In recent years, many methods for video object detection have been proposed. Video has rich temporal information, which we can exploit to enhance the performance of video object detection. It can overcome the problem of the degradation of the detection effect when the video object appears to motion blur, occlusion, and appearance change.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Some video object detection methods take advantage of the fact that the same object may appear in multiple frames within a certain period to improve the robustness of the whole detection. These methods first detect video frames as independent images and then use post-processing methods (such as frame sequence NMS <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>, tracking <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>, or other temporal consistency methods <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>) to enhance the confidence of weak detections in the video. This method requires the algorithm to produce some strong predictions; however, in our task, some flying bird objects are difficult to identify from appearance to disappearance, so we cannot utilize this kind of video object detection method to solve our problem.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">Another type of video object detection method uses the idea of feature aggregation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>, <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>, <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>, <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>, <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>, <a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>, <a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>, <a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>, <a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite> to improve the overall detection effect. These methods enhance the feature information of the current frame by aggregating the Spatio-temporal information of different frames to improve the detection performance of degraded frames (when the video object has motion blur, occlusion, and appearance change, the detection effect is degraded). However, their main purpose is still to solve the effect degradation problem in video object detection. When applying their idea to our task, it will have some effect (we also need to aggregate the Spatio-temporal information of adjacent frames to enhance the features of the flying bird object in the current frame, thus overcoming the problem of missing object features caused by small or blurred objects in a single frame), but there will still be a lot of false detections and missed detections. We further analyze that their method first extracts the intermediate features of a single frame image and then aggregates the extracted intermediate features to aggregate spatio-temporal information. Since the objects in their experimental data are clear and have large sizes on most images, problems such as short blur, occlusion, and appearance change can be solved after aggregation. However, in our task, the features of most flying bird objects are not obvious on any image, and the size is small. In the feature extraction process of single frame images, the features of the flying bird objects are easily lost, which leads to the failure of spatio-temporal information aggregation. Secondly, due to the object’s small size, the problem of low signal-to-noise ratio (unbalanced positive and negative samples) is not easy to eliminate in the training process.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p7" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p7.1" class="ltx_p">We found that some works detect video objects by generating Spatio-temporal Cubes (St-Cubes) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite> or tubelets <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite>. These methods can improve the SNR of video objects, especially small objects; however, since they do not consider that when the object moves too slowly, the object in the pipeline will lack the surrounding environmental information, which is also crucial for our task.</p>

Then, an object tracking algorithm is used to track suspicious flying bird objects and calculate their Motion Range (MR). At the same time, the size of the MR of the suspicious flying bird object is adjusted adaptively according to its speed of movement (specifically, if the bird moves slowly, its MR wil be expanded according to the speed of the bird to ensure the environmental information needed to detect the flying bird object). Adaptive Spatio-temporal Cubes (ASt-Cubes) of the flying bird objects are generated to ensure that the SNR of the flying bird objects is improved, and the necessary environmental information is retained adaptively. Finally, a LightWeight U-Shape Net (LW-USN) based on ASt-Cubes is designed to detect flying bird objects, which rejects the false detections of the suspicious flying bird objects and returns the position of the real flying bird objects.</p>

<div id="S1.p9" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p9.1" class="ltx_p">There is an interesting work to detect flying birds, Glances and Stare Detection(GSD)<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite>, which simulates the characteristics of human observation of moving small objects by first taking a Glance at the whole image and then taking a closer look at the places that may contain the object. Formally, the region proposal sequence obtained by localization is first used to construct the candidate region sequence, and then the classification method is used to classify the candidate region sequence, and the classification results are fed back to localization to guide the generation of new region proposals. The region proposal is continuously narrowed by alternating localization and classification until the object is locked. The essence of GSD can be seen as solving the problem of low SNR of flying birds. Since the characteristics of the birds in the experimental data set are obvious on a single frame image, this work does not consider the problem that the characteristics of the object are not obvious on a single frame image (the input of the localization stage is the current frame). In this paper, the problem of missing features of the flying bird object on a single frame image and low SNR of the flying bird object is solved simply.</p>

Literature <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite> proposed a complete framework for video object detection based on static image object detection and general object tracking.

First, the feature extraction of each frame image is performed separately, and then the extracted features are aggregated, which has a good effect on the ImageNet dataset <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>]</cite>. However, in our scene, most of the flying birds, the appearance features on any single frame are not particularly rich, the bird size is small, and the bird features are easily lost when extracting the features of a certain frame image alone. At the same time, looking at consecutive frames makes it more obvious where there are birds, which indicates that the flying bird has complementary feature information on multiple consecutive frames. Therefore, we use ConvLSTM to aggregate the features of the flying bird object on consecutive frames before the input of the model (instead of aggregating at the intermediate feature layer) and use the aggregated features to locate the flying bird object.</p>

At this time, if the St-Cube of the flying bird object is still obtained by the above method, the slow moving flying bird object will lack the surrounding environment information, which will lead to the degradation of the flying bird object detection performance in this part. Therefore, the flying bird object’s motion information (motion speed) is considered in this paper. When the motion amount of the flying bird object is lower than a certain threshold, its motion range is expanded, and the environmental information of the flying bird object is increased to improve the identification of the flying bird object.</p>

<p id="S3.SS1.SSS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In convolutional neural networks, deeper layers generally have smaller sizes, better global semantic information, and can predict larger objects. The shallower depth layers generally have a larger size, have more delicate spatial information, and can predict smaller objects. However, the large feature layer often does not have a relatively high degree of semantic information, and the small feature layer does not have sufficient spatial positioning information. Therefore, relevant researchers have proposed the structure of FPN <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>]</cite> to combine the strong semantic information of the small feature layer and the strong spatial positioning information of the large feature layer. However, the researchers of PANet(Path Aggregation Network) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>]</cite> found that when FPN transmitted information, there was information loss due to the transfer distance when the information was transmitted to the low-level feature layer. Therefore, path-enhanced FPN, namely PANet structure (see Fig. <a href="#S3.F4" title="Figure 4 ‣ III-A2 Localization of Suspicious flying bird Objects ‣ III-A To Capture the Suspicious Flying Bird Object ‣ III The Proposed FBOD-BMI ‣ Flying Bird Object Detection Algorithm in Surveillance Video Based on Motion Information" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a>), was proposed. The PANet structure opens up a green channel for low-level information transmission and avoids low-level information loss to a certain extent. In this paper, the PANet structure is used to classify and locate flying bird objects.</p>

Respectively, the original MR of the suspicious flying bird object is extracted using the object tracking technology (Section <a href="#S3.SS2.SSS1" title="III-B1 Acquisition of the Original MR of the Suspicious flying bird Object ‣ III-B To Obtain the ASt-Cubes of flying bird objects ‣ III The Proposed FBOD-BMI ‣ Flying Bird Object Detection Algorithm in Surveillance Video Based on Motion Information" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag"><span class="ltx_text">III-B</span>1</span></a>), and the MR is adaptively adjusted using the motion amount of the suspicious flying bird object to obtain the ASt-Cubes (Section <a href="#S3.SS2.SSS2" title="III-B2 Adaptively Adjust the MR to Obtain ASt-Cubes Based on the Amount of Motion ‣ III-B To Obtain the ASt-Cubes of flying bird objects ‣ III The Proposed FBOD-BMI ‣ Flying Bird Object Detection Algorithm in Surveillance Video Based on Motion Information" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag"><span class="ltx_text">III-B</span>2</span></a>).</p>

The St-Cube eliminates the interference of other background and negative samples, which can improve the SNR of the flying bird object. However, suppose the flying bird object moves too slowly. In that case, the resulting St-Cubes will lack the necessary environmental information (see Raw St-Cube in Fig. <a href="#S3.F6" title="Figure 6 ‣ III-B2 Adaptively Adjust the MR to Obtain ASt-Cubes Based on the Amount of Motion ‣ III-B To Obtain the ASt-Cubes of flying bird objects ‣ III The Proposed FBOD-BMI ‣ Flying Bird Object Detection Algorithm in Surveillance Video Based on Motion Information" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">6</span></a>), which is not conducive to the detection of flying bird objects. To balance the contradiction between SNR and environmental information, this paper proposes an ASt-Cubes extraction method based on the amount of motion of the flying bird object, which adaptively adjusts the size of the MR of the flying bird object according to the speed of the object’s motion. There are two steps.</p>

The coarse-detection model may detect multiple suspicious flying bird objects at one time, so there will be multiple ASt-Cubes, and the fine-detection model will detect each ASt-Cubes separately. So it is possible to run a coarse-detection model once and a fine-detection model many times. Therefore, to balance the accuracy and speed, the way of aggregating the Spatio-temporal features of the flying bird object in the fine-inspection stage is used to merge the input of multiple consecutive frames. At the same time, to reduce data redundancy, except for the middle frame, the rest of the frames are input in the form of a grayscale image single channel. Specifically, firstly, grayscale the screenshots of the ASt-Cubes of the flying bird object except for the middle screenshot,</p>

<p id="S3.SS3.SSS2.p4.1" class="ltx_p">The ASt-Cube of a flying bird object may contain more than one object. Moreover, due to the interference of background and negative samples, the detection accuracy of the coarse-detection model is not satisfactory; there will be false and missed detection. So, the ASt-Cube may contain no object, one object, or multiple objects. Therefore, the detection model in the fine-detection stage should still have the ability of multi-object detection. However, since the ASt-Cubes of flying bird objects are only a small area (relative to the input image) and cannot contain many flying bird objects, the output of the fine-detection model need not be designed with a complex structure. In summary, the paper uses a relatively simple Single Scale Detection Head (SS-D Head) structure as the output structure of the fine-detection model (see Fig. <a href="#S3.F7" title="Figure 7 ‣ III-C2 Classification and Localization of flying bird objects ‣ III-C flying bird Object Detection Based on St-Cube ‣ III The Proposed FBOD-BMI ‣ Flying Bird Object Detection Algorithm in Surveillance Video Based on Motion Information" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">7</span></a>).

In the first (aggregation mode I), we directly place the ConvLSTM module before the input of the CSPDarkNet53, the backbone network of the YOLOV4 model (i.e., the input of CSPDarkNet53 was originally an image, but now the input is the output of ConvLSTM aggregations of the features of five consecutive frames of images.

This indicates that feature aggregation, when the features of the flying bird object gradually disappear, will affect the feature expression of the flying bird object instead. Therefore, our algorithm adopts the aggregation mode I to aggregate the features of flying bird objects. In addition, for the same aggregation mode, the detection accuracy will be greatly improved after adding the Fine-Detection stage.</p>

<p id="S4.SS5.SSS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We design test experiments with different numbers of consecutive frame inputs to evaluate the impact on the detection accuracy and efficiency of the proposed method. Specifically, there are three consecutive frames of input, five consecutive frames of input, seven consecutive frames of input, etc. Theoretically, with the increase in the number of consecutive frames, the motion information of the flying bird object will be gradually enriched. However, the motion range of the flying bird object will also increase, and the difficulty of feature aggregation will also increase. Therefore, as the number of consecutive frames increases, the detection accuracy of the algorithm should be a process of first rising and then falling. Meanwhile, as the number of consecutive frames increases, the algorithm’s running time will increase accordingly. The algorithm’s detection performance test results are shown in TABLE <a href="#S4.T2" title="TABLE II ‣ IV-E2 Effect of Different Number of Consecutive Input Frames on the Performance of the Algorithm. ‣ IV-E Parameter Analysis Experiments ‣ IV Experiment ‣ Flying Bird Object Detection Algorithm in Surveillance Video Based on Motion Information" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">II</span></a> (the motion amount parameter <math id="S4.SS5.SSS2.p1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="{\sigma}_{mov}" display="inline"><semantics id="S4.SS5.SSS2.p1.1.m1.1a"><msub id="S4.SS5.SSS2.p1.1.m1.1.1" xref="S4.SS5.SSS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml"><mi id="S4.SS5.SSS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.2" xref="S4.SS5.SSS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml">σ</mi><mrow id="S4.SS5.SSS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.3" xref="S4.SS5.SSS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml"><mi id="S4.SS5.SSS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.2" xref="S4.SS5.SSS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.2.cmml">m</mi><mo lspace="0em" rspace="0em" id="S4.SS5.SSS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.1" xref="S4.SS5.SSS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.1.cmml">​</mo><mi id="S4.SS5.SSS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.3" xref="S4.SS5.SSS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.3.cmml">o</mi><mo lspace="0em" rspace="0em" id="S4.SS5.SSS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.1a" xref="S4.SS5.SSS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.1.cmml">​</mo><mi id="S4.SS5.SSS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.4" xref="S4.SS5.SSS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.4.cmml">v</mi></mrow></msub><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S4.SS5.SSS2.p1.1.m1.1b"><apply id="S4.SS5.SSS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS5.SSS2.p1.1.m1.1.1"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S4.SS5.SSS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS5.SSS2.p1.1.m1.1.1">subscript</csymbol><ci id="S4.SS5.SSS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S4.SS5.SSS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.2">𝜎</ci><apply id="S4.SS5.SSS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S4.SS5.SSS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.3"><times id="S4.SS5.SSS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS5.SSS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.1"></times><ci id="S4.SS5.SSS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.2.cmml" xref="S4.SS5.SSS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.2">𝑚</ci><ci id="S4.SS5.SSS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.3.cmml" xref="S4.SS5.SSS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.3">𝑜</ci><ci id="S4.SS5.SSS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.4.cmml" xref="S4.SS5.SSS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.4">𝑣</ci></apply></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S4.SS5.SSS2.p1.1.m1.1c">{\sigma}_{mov}</annotation></semantics></math> is set to 4.0). The experimental results show that the algorithm has the fastest running speed but the lowest detection accuracy when input is input for three consecutive frames. The detection accuracy and running time are better when the input is for five consecutive frames. Therefore, five consecutive frames of input are used in our algorithm.</p>

<p id="S4.SS6.p4.1" class="ltx_p">In the qualitative comparison experiment, YOLOV5l <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite> and SELSA <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite> with higher detection accuracy are selected to compare with the proposed method. By comparing the experimental results shown in Fig. <a href="#S4.F11" title="Figure 11 ‣ IV-F Comparative Analysis Experiments ‣ IV Experiment ‣ Flying Bird Object Detection Algorithm in Surveillance Video Based on Motion Information" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">11</span></a>, it can be seen that when the appearance characteristics of the flying bird object are relatively obvious, all the methods can detect the object (see Fig. <a href="#S4.F11.sf1d" title="In Figure 11 ‣ IV-F Comparative Analysis Experiments ‣ IV Experiment ‣ Flying Bird Object Detection Algorithm in Surveillance Video Based on Motion Information" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">11a</span></a> and Fig. <a href="#S4.F11.sf2d" title="In Figure 11 ‣ IV-F Comparative Analysis Experiments ‣ IV Experiment ‣ Flying Bird Object Detection Algorithm in Surveillance Video Based on Motion Information" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">11b</span></a>). However, YOLOV5l <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite> and SELSA <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite> will miss detection when the appearance features of a single frame image of a flying bird object are not obvious. However, the proposed method can achieve good results regardless of whether the appearance features of the single frame image of the flying bird object are obvious or not (see Fig. <a href="#S4.F11.sf3d" title="In Figure 11 ‣ IV-F Comparative Analysis Experiments ‣ IV Experiment ‣ Flying Bird Object Detection Algorithm in Surveillance Video Based on Motion Information" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">11c</span></a> and Fig. <a href="#S4.F11.sf4d" title="In Figure 11 ‣ IV-F Comparative Analysis Experiments ‣ IV Experiment ‣ Flying Bird Object Detection Algorithm in Surveillance Video Based on Motion Information" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">11d</span></a>). At the same time, we find that the detection box of the proposed method is not as compact as YOLOV5l <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite> and SELSA <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>, which verifies the experimental results in the table, that is, with the increase of IOU threshold, the detection accuracy of the proposed method decreases faster than that of YOLOV5 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite> and SELSA <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>. However, this does not affect the effectiveness of the proposed method because for our task, detection is more important than detection accuracy, and since the object is small, such a difference can be ignored.</p>

<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">This paper proposes a flying bird Object Detection algorithm Based on Motion Information (FBOD-BMI) to solve the problem that the features of the object are not obvious in a single frame and the object’s size is small (low SNR in surveillance video). Firstly, the ConvLSTM-PANet model was used to coarse detect the whole frame of continuous video frames to capture suspicious flying bird objects. Then, the object tracking method tracks the suspicious flying bird object, and the MR Of the suspicious flying bird object on <math id="S5.p1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="n" display="inline"><semantics id="S5.p1.1.m1.1a"><mi id="S5.p1.1.m1.1.1" xref="S5.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml">n</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S5.p1.1.m1.1b"><ci id="S5.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S5.p1.1.m1.1.1">𝑛</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S5.p1.1.m1.1c">n</annotation></semantics></math> consecutive frames of images is determined. At the same time, according to the movement speed of the suspicious flying bird object, the size of its MR is adaptively adjusted (specifically, if the object is moving slowly, its MR is expanded according to its speed to ensure the context environment information), and its adaptive St-Cubes (ASt-Cubes) are generated to ensure that the SNR of the flying bird object is improved while the necessary environmental information is retained adaptively. Then, the ASt-Cubes of suspicious flying bird objects are accurately classified and located by the LW-USN model. Finally, qualitative and quantitative experiments verify the effectiveness of the proposed flying bird object detection algorithm based on motion information. At the same time, we proved through ablation experiments that for the problem that the features of single frame images of flying bird objects in videos are not obvious, it is necessary to perform feature fusion before feature extraction as much as possible.</p>
