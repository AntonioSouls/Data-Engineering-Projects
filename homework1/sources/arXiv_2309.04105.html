<p id="id20.id1" class="ltx_p">The annotation of 3D datasets is required for semantic-segmentation and object detection in scene understanding. In this paper we present a framework for the weakly supervision of a point clouds transformer that is used for 3D object detection. The aim is to decrease the required amount of supervision needed for training, as a result of the high cost of annotating a 3D datasets. We propose an Unsupervised Voting Proposal Module, which learns randomly preset anchor points and uses voting network to select prepared anchor points of high quality. Then it distills information into student and teacher network. In terms of student network, we apply ResNet network to efficiently extract local characteristics. However, it also can lose much global information. To provide the input which incorporates the global and local information as the input of student networks, we adopt the self-attention mechanism of transformer to extract global features, and the ResNet layers to extract region proposals. The teacher network supervises the classification and regression of the student network using the pre-trained model on ImageNet. On the challenging KITTI datasets, the experimental results have achieved the highest level of average precision compared with the most recent weakly supervised 3D object detectors.</p>

<p id="S1.p1.2" class="ltx_p">3D object detection has been a popular field with various applications, it functions as a major technology in scene understanding in automatic driving [16] . Due to the fact that 3D point clouds can reflect the in-depth information of 3D objects, researchers have taken it as starting the point to carry out research on 3D object detectors, which can express point clouds objects in the terms of normal 3D bounding box [17] . However, 3D object detection model training requires man ually labeling a large number of 3D bounding boxes around the irregular point clouds objects, which will lead to high cost of annotating thus to impede the application of 3D object detection. Currently, a large quantity of 3D object detectors [18] are mainly based on fully supervised learning and rely on a large number of 3D annotation truth boxes, which means limitations on scene applications that lack 3D labels. Therefore, study on weakly supervised or semi-supervised 3D object detectors with only a small number of 3D labels are practically significant. Researchers have also made certain achievements in their study on weakly supervised 2D object detectors and self-supervised 3D object detection [19] [20] . One of the superiorities of 3D detectors are detecting 3D object from point clouds in a weakly supervised way, and the 3D proposal bounding box, which is directly generated by the Unsupervised Proposal Module (UPM) of the VS3D [15] through the rotated and corrected preset anchor points. But one shortcoming of its performance is that it is not optimal due to the loss of geometric information from the virtual point clouds which is originated from the preset anchor points mapping. Moreover, the VGG16 network is not effective in serving the interests of teachers or students.

<br class="ltx_break">   In this work, we aim to solve these problems in VS3D, and the results of the experiment are better than those of VS3D. An overview of this paper follows a framework that we develop weakly supervised 3D object detection from point clouds transformer (WSPCT3D). First project 3D object proposals generated by the Unsupervised Voting Proposal Module (UVPM) onto the XYZ-map that relates to the point cloud in the same scene. Second, to blend global and local proposals, the backbone network of the student network leverages both the Self-Attention of the transformer and ResNet to merge the high-quality filtered proposal boxes with the XYZ-map generated after the input point clouds. Third, due to the lack of ground truth supervision, the precision of object recognition and classification using only student networks is not high, and the generalization ability among different datasets and settings is weak. To solve the problem, we apply a pre-trained teacher model to supervise the student network, with the student network modeling the behavior of the teacher during the training process. We also perform extensive experiments on the challenging KITTI [25] datasets to validate the proposed approach and its components. Promising results were based on several evaluation indicators. <span id="S1.p1.2.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Our method does not adopt any ground truth labels of 3D bounding boxes as the supervision of the training process</span>. Our experimental results show that is better than that of SOTA model VS3D.

<p id="S2.p1.2" class="ltx_p">The purpose of 3D object detection is to detect the objects of interest and locate the 3D bounding boxes of the them. [1] proposes to extract 4D point clouds and detector boxes through the combination of 3D spatial and 1D temporal. PVGNet [2] voxelizes the point clouds to produce multi-level voxel features. [3] effectively combines features based on voxel and point to predict 3D bounding box. [4] leverages the disentangling transformation for 2D and 3D detection losses to produce high-quality 3D bounding boxes. [5] proposes a decoupling model of feature learning and external object prediction. [6] leverages the categorical depth distribution network to obtain the depth interval of the pixels. However, most of the existing methods are based on sufficient ground truth.

<br class="ltx_break">   Weakly supervised object detection assumes that the instance-level bounding boxes annotations are not provided by the training set. The weakly supervised object detection is realized using a small amount of labeled data to supervise a large amount of other unlabeled data. [7] alleviates the huge annotation burden and accurately predicts the object bounding box according to the point annotation. [8] describes the noisy label data with uncertainty, and alleviates the attention imbalance under data of different difficulty levels, thus can well fit all unmarked images. [9] proposes an efficient jointly thing-and-stuff mining (JTSM) framework for weakly supervised panoptic segmentation. [10] proposes a novel coupled multiple instance detection network(C-MIDN), which combines a pair of MIDNs with proposal removal. [11] tries to learn the texture 3D model of 3D reconstruction to solve the problem of 3D object detection, but its purpose is not to locate the 3D bounding box of the object. Learning 3D detection without complete supervision is more challenging, which will be explored in this paper.

<br class="ltx_break">   Knowledge distillation [12] is extensively used in transferring supervision cross modalities, for example [13] proposes a novel transferable semi-supervised 3D object detection network, which trains the backbone network to make class-agnostic segmentation and class-conditioned initial 3D box predictions on the strong classes in a fully-supervised manner. [14] proposes a weakly supervised pose estimation method using only 2D landmark annotation, which poses no restriction on the architecture of the student pose estimation network, and realizes accurate 3D pose estimation. [15] proposes a new Unbiased Mean Teacher (UMT) model for cross-domain object detection, which improves the effectiveness of knowledge distillation between teacher model and student model, and eliminate the impact of model bias. [16] proposes a cross-model data enhancement method to train the 3D object detector, and it uses the high-dimensional features of CNN to fuse with the point cloud of 3D detector. At present, cross-model learning is mainly applied to 2D recognition tasks, such as 2D detection and segmentation, while the 3D geometric information in depth data is not fully utilized. In addition, [34-37] recently proposed deep networks on point clouds for point clouds feature information learning. In the current research of weakly supervised 3D object detection, the interest of backbone network is not high, therefore our method explores how to characterize the object information in 3D more effectively.</p>

Therefore, to solve the problem of the UPM, this paper proposes a UVPM, where 3D object proposals are output indicating that it is potentially contained within the regions from the input point clouds. The steps of how the UVPM works are as the following: Firstly, the preset anchors are placed at 0.2m intervals in the plane regions of [-35m, 35m]x[0, 70m] without the ground truth supervision, next the potential regions are filtered by the normalized point clouds density [15] threshold as object proposals regions, and then the selected anchors from the object proposals are mapped as pseudo point cloud of them. Secondly, the pseudo point clouds of the anchors passes the PointNet network to be output as a subset of <math id="S3.SS2.p1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="M&lt;N" display="inline"><semantics id="S3.SS2.p1.1.m1.1a"><mrow id="S3.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1" xref="S3.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml"><mi id="S3.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.2" xref="S3.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml">M</mi><mo id="S3.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.1" xref="S3.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml">&lt;</mo><mi id="S3.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.3" xref="S3.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml">N</mi></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S3.SS2.p1.1.m1.1b"><apply id="S3.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1"><lt id="S3.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.1"></lt><ci id="S3.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S3.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.2">𝑀</ci><ci id="S3.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S3.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.3">𝑁</ci></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S3.SS2.p1.1.m1.1c">M&lt;N</annotation></semantics></math> seed anchors information of the input anchor-pseudo point clouds, and then the local and global generated characteristics of each anchor in the object proposal regions can be extracted.

<p id="S3.SS2.SSS1.p1.11" class="ltx_p">The size of pseudo point clouds of the anchors of is N ×3, with a 3D coordinate for each of the N preset anchors, we aim to generate M voting anchors, where each preset anchor has both a 3D coordinate and a high dimensional feature vector. In the first stage, generating an accurate voting anchor requires geometric reasoning and contexts. Instead of relying on hand-crafted features, we adopt PointNet as our backbone due to its simplicity and it has demonstrated success on tasks ranging from normal estimation, semantic segmentation to 3D object localization [31-33]. The backbone network has several set-abstraction layers and feature propagation (upsampling) layers with skip connections, which outputs a subset of the preset anchors with XYZ and an enriched C-dimensional feature vector. The result is the generation of M seed anchors of dimension (3 + C). In the second stage, VoteNet [21] is a 3D point clouds single-stage object detector. To reduce the weight, VoteNet first processes the seed anchors <math id="S3.SS2.SSS1.p1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\{{x_{i}}\}_{i=1}^{N}" display="inline"><semantics id="S3.SS2.SSS1.p1.1.m1.1a"><msubsup id="S3.SS2.SSS1.p1.1.m1.1.1" xref="S3.SS2.SSS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml"><mrow id="S3.SS2.SSS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1" xref="S3.SS2.SSS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.2.cmml"><mo stretchy="false" id="S3.SS2.SSS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.2" xref="S3.SS2.SSS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.2.cmml">{</mo><msub id="S3.SS2.SSS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.1" xref="S3.SS2.SSS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.1.cmml"><mi id="S3.SS2.SSS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.1.2" xref="S3.SS2.SSS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.1.2.cmml">x</mi><mi id="S3.SS2.SSS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.1.3" xref="S3.SS2.SSS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.1.3.cmml">i</mi></msub><mo stretchy="false" id="S3.SS2.SSS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.3" xref="S3.SS2.SSS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.2.cmml">}</mo></mrow><mrow id="S3.SS2.SSS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.3" xref="S3.SS2.SSS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.3.cmml"><mi id="S3.SS2.SSS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.3.2" xref="S3.SS2.SSS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.3.2.cmml">i</mi><mo id="S3.SS2.SSS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.3.1" xref="S3.SS2.SSS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.3.1.cmml">=</mo><mn id="S3.SS2.SSS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.3.3" xref="S3.SS2.SSS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.3.3.cmml">1</mn></mrow><mi id="S3.SS2.SSS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.3" xref="S3.SS2.SSS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml">N</mi></msubsup><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S3.SS2.SSS1.p1.1.m1.1b"><apply id="S3.SS2.SSS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS2.SSS1.p1.1.m1.1.1"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S3.SS2.SSS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S3.SS2.SSS1.p1.1.m1.1.1">superscript</csymbol><apply id="S3.SS2.SSS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS2.SSS1.p1.1.m1.1.1"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S3.SS2.SSS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S3.SS2.SSS1.p1.1.m1.1.1">subscript</csymbol><set id="S3.SS2.SSS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S3.SS2.SSS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1"><apply id="S3.SS2.SSS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS2.SSS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.1"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S3.SS2.SSS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS2.SSS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.1">subscript</csymbol><ci id="S3.SS2.SSS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S3.SS2.SSS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.1.2">𝑥</ci><ci id="S3.SS2.SSS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S3.SS2.SSS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.1.3">𝑖</ci></apply></set><apply id="S3.SS2.SSS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S3.SS2.SSS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.3"><eq id="S3.SS2.SSS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.3.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS2.SSS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.3.1"></eq><ci id="S3.SS2.SSS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.3.2.cmml" xref="S3.SS2.SSS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.3.2">𝑖</ci><cn type="integer" id="S3.SS2.SSS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.3.3.cmml" xref="S3.SS2.SSS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.3.3">1</cn></apply></apply><ci id="S3.SS2.SSS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S3.SS2.SSS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.3">𝑁</ci></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S3.SS2.SSS1.p1.1.m1.1c">\{{x_{i}}\}_{i=1}^{N}</annotation></semantics></math> to generate a sub sampling set composed of <math id="S3.SS2.SSS1.p1.2.m2.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="M&lt;N" display="inline"><semantics id="S3.SS2.SSS1.p1.2.m2.1a"><mrow id="S3.SS2.SSS1.p1.2.m2.1.1" xref="S3.SS2.SSS1.p1.2.m2.1.1.cmml"><mi id="S3.SS2.SSS1.p1.2.m2.1.1.2" xref="S3.SS2.SSS1.p1.2.m2.1.1.2.cmml">M</mi><mo id="S3.SS2.SSS1.p1.2.m2.1.1.1" xref="S3.SS2.SSS1.p1.2.m2.1.1.1.cmml">&lt;</mo><mi id="S3.SS2.SSS1.p1.2.m2.1.1.3" xref="S3.SS2.SSS1.p1.2.m2.1.1.3.cmml">N</mi></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S3.SS2.SSS1.p1.2.m2.1b"><apply id="S3.SS2.SSS1.p1.2.m2.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS2.SSS1.p1.2.m2.1.1"><lt id="S3.SS2.SSS1.p1.2.m2.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS2.SSS1.p1.2.m2.1.1.1"></lt><ci id="S3.SS2.SSS1.p1.2.m2.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S3.SS2.SSS1.p1.2.m2.1.1.2">𝑀</ci><ci id="S3.SS2.SSS1.p1.2.m2.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S3.SS2.SSS1.p1.2.m2.1.1.3">𝑁</ci></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S3.SS2.SSS1.p1.2.m2.1c">M&lt;N</annotation></semantics></math> object loss combinations: the votes are divided into <math id="S3.SS2.SSS1.p1.3.m3.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="K" display="inline"><semantics id="S3.SS2.SSS1.p1.3.m3.1a"><mi id="S3.SS2.SSS1.p1.3.m3.1.1" xref="S3.SS2.SSS1.p1.3.m3.1.1.cmml">K</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S3.SS2.SSS1.p1.3.m3.1b"><ci id="S3.SS2.SSS1.p1.3.m3.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS2.SSS1.p1.3.m3.1.1">𝐾</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S3.SS2.SSS1.p1.3.m3.1c">K</annotation></semantics></math> voting clusters, and each seed point votes on the center of the object to which it belongs.

<p id="S3.SS3.p1.2" class="ltx_p">The front view representation complements the bird view representation by providing additional information. Because the LIDAR point clouds are sparse, projecting it onto the image plane produces a sparse 2D point map. As a result, before inputting the backbone, we convert the input point cloud into a dense front view XYZ map, which is similar to work [22].

<p id="S3.SS4.p1.4" class="ltx_p">The student network, as shown in Figure 2, mainly includes the ResNet and the Self-Attention based on transformer, the RoIAlign [23] layer, and the two fully connected layers in the second stage of 3D object detector. As the structure of ResNet is described in detail in Figure 2, therefore this section focuses on the principles of the Self-Attention mechanism based on Transformer. The Self-Attention mechanism can be viewed of as mapping a query and a gathering of key value pairs to the output, with the query, key, value, and outcome all representing vectors as shown in Figure 3. The output is a weighted sum of values, with the weight being assigned to each value determined by the compatibility function of query and its corresponding key. Instead of applying the key, value, and query, it is advisable to apply various learning linear projections to linearly project the query, key, and value to the <math id="S3.SS4.p1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="d_{k}" display="inline"><semantics id="S3.SS4.p1.1.m1.1a"><msub id="S3.SS4.p1.1.m1.1.1" xref="S3.SS4.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml"><mi id="S3.SS4.p1.1.m1.1.1.2" xref="S3.SS4.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml">d</mi><mi id="S3.SS4.p1.1.m1.1.1.3" xref="S3.SS4.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml">k</mi></msub><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S3.SS4.p1.1.m1.1b"><apply id="S3.SS4.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS4.p1.1.m1.1.1"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S3.SS4.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS4.p1.1.m1.1.1">subscript</csymbol><ci id="S3.SS4.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S3.SS4.p1.1.m1.1.1.2">𝑑</ci><ci id="S3.SS4.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S3.SS4.p1.1.m1.1.1.3">𝑘</ci></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S3.SS4.p1.1.m1.1c">d_{k}</annotation></semantics></math>, <math id="S3.SS4.p1.2.m2.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="d_{k}" display="inline"><semantics id="S3.SS4.p1.2.m2.1a"><msub id="S3.SS4.p1.2.m2.1.1" xref="S3.SS4.p1.2.m2.1.1.cmml"><mi id="S3.SS4.p1.2.m2.1.1.2" xref="S3.SS4.p1.2.m2.1.1.2.cmml">d</mi><mi id="S3.SS4.p1.2.m2.1.1.3" xref="S3.SS4.p1.2.m2.1.1.3.cmml">k</mi></msub><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S3.SS4.p1.2.m2.1b"><apply id="S3.SS4.p1.2.m2.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS4.p1.2.m2.1.1"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S3.SS4.p1.2.m2.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS4.p1.2.m2.1.1">subscript</csymbol><ci id="S3.SS4.p1.2.m2.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S3.SS4.p1.2.m2.1.1.2">𝑑</ci><ci id="S3.SS4.p1.2.m2.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S3.SS4.p1.2.m2.1.1.3">𝑘</ci></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S3.SS4.p1.2.m2.1c">d_{k}</annotation></semantics></math> and <math id="S3.SS4.p1.3.m3.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="d_{v}" display="inline"><semantics id="S3.SS4.p1.3.m3.1a"><msub id="S3.SS4.p1.3.m3.1.1" xref="S3.SS4.p1.3.m3.1.1.cmml"><mi id="S3.SS4.p1.3.m3.1.1.2" xref="S3.SS4.p1.3.m3.1.1.2.cmml">d</mi><mi id="S3.SS4.p1.3.m3.1.1.3" xref="S3.SS4.p1.3.m3.1.1.3.cmml">v</mi></msub><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S3.SS4.p1.3.m3.1b"><apply id="S3.SS4.p1.3.m3.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS4.p1.3.m3.1.1"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S3.SS4.p1.3.m3.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS4.p1.3.m3.1.1">subscript</csymbol><ci id="S3.SS4.p1.3.m3.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S3.SS4.p1.3.m3.1.1.2">𝑑</ci><ci id="S3.SS4.p1.3.m3.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S3.SS4.p1.3.m3.1.1.3">𝑣</ci></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S3.SS4.p1.3.m3.1c">d_{v}</annotation></semantics></math> dimensions, respectively.

<p id="S3.SS5.SSS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The image-based teacher network uses VGG16 as the backbone for image classification and viewpoint regression tasks, with pre-training on ImageNet [30] and PASCALVOC [29] using the image level classification labels provided [24]. The teacher network accepts an image of no more than one item as input, next classifies it as background or a group of objects, and then returns the object viewpoint to its original rotation. A multi-box classification issue is referred to as viewpoint regression. The probability of 16 corner boxes split from a unit circle is predicted. The regression model of the angle of all boxes is the outcome of rotation. Teacher network is used to train a 3D object detection model as a prepared model.</p>

<p id="S3.SS5.SSS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Each object proposes two predictions from teacher and student during the training process. Student imitate the confidence of the teacher network using the corrected cross entropy loss [15]. However, the teacher network may be ambiguous when the ability of the ready-made teacher network extracts the student network of various datasets. Firstly, if the teacher network is uncertain about its own output information, it information will not be passed on to student. Therefore, the classification score will not be applied to a training student branch if the classification score of the teacher network is in the ambiguous regions. Secondly, in the training process, we can extract recognition information from the teacher network and transfer it to the student network by matching the RGB image of the object with the point cloud. To be more specific, we project each generated object proposal by UVPM to an RGB image and a front view XYZ map. Furthermore, students use the corrected cross entropy loss to imitate the confidence of teachers network. Then we apply the teacher network to recognize the item proposal by removing the projection on the image. Simultaneously, we apply RoIAlign [23] to extract each proposed coding feature from the student backbone network and give these characteristics to the fully connected layers in order to predict the 3D bounding box of object.</p>

The experiments were conducted on KITTI datasets, which contain real image data from urban, rural and highway scenes, with up to 15 vehicles and 30 pedestrians in each image, along with various levels of occlusion. KITTI datasets provides multiple unified evaluation matrices, including average Precision (AP) and Recall rate curve at different intersection of Union (IOU) Thresholds and different occlusion level. Our experiment is based on the Linux, Tensorflow-gpu=1.12.0, Python 3.6 and TeslaV100S-PCIE platforms.</p>

We use the region filtered by the normalized point clouds density threshold as object proposals region, which represent the anchor points in the object proposals region as pseudo point clouds. In the PointNet network, the pseudo point clouds pass through four point feature extraction layers in turn, then it generates a point cloud with additional features that is called the Seed Anchor after passing two Feature propagation(FP) Modules. The pseudo point clouds feature channels are set as 3-coordinate channels (X, Y, Z) and 58 additional channels, which are used as inputs of the first feature extraction layer together. Region is set as Raidus [0.2, 0.4, 0.8, 1.2] in turn. All multi-layer Perception(MLP) have the sizes of [64, 64, 128]. The sizes of the MLPS of the two FP layers are [128, 128] and [256, 256] respectively. The Seed Anchors are generated a small number of proposal anchors with additional features through Voting Module layers output as (2048, 4). It is suggested that anchors can be used as central candidate points of 2D Proposal bounding boxes, then passing the center rotation, alignment, and correction are carried out for the 2D Proposal bounding boxes, and we built the loss functions of rotation, alignment, and correction for evaluation.</p>

<p id="S4.SS1.SSS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The fusion of the ResNet and Attention in the student network is shown in Figure 2. We begin cropping the xyz-map to the shape (1, 128, 128, 3) and input it into two branches: (1) First, 3D bounding boxes are generated by UPM or UVPM modules, and then features extracted from 2D bounding boxes by RoIAlign are integrated with XYZ-Map by adding feature channels while keeping the same batch length and width. We then input the fused features into the Self-Attention and Conv2D branches again by adding the feature channels. In the self-attention block, the dropout was 0.5, and the Conv1D convolution kernel was 4 in size and an Attention head. However, the number of Self-Attention (SA) blocks as shown in Figure 2(a) was 4. In addition, we set two Self-Attention blocks for comparison. The size of all convolution kernels in Conv2D blocks is [3, 3] , dilation-rate set as 1. It is worth noting that the number of SA blocks and Conv2D blocks changes in the same way. After that, the features fused with SA block and Conv2D block were simultaneously fused with the downstream up-sampled convolution layer channel, as shown in Figure 2(a). At last Mask-point clouds was output. (2) XYZ-Map was output after five stages of ResNet as the shape (1, 4, 4, 2048). And then the features extracted from 2D bounding box by RoIAlign are integrated in the way of feature channel addition. In ResNet networks, we set ResNet50 and ResNet53 for comparison. The only difference between these two networks is the number of convolutional layers. The size of all convolutional kernels is [3, 3], dilation-rate is 1. Finally, we fuse the features from SA block and Conv2D block in the first branch with those from the second branch. The probability of Rotation is output through two full connection layers, and Classification is output by two full connection layers. During the experiment, according to the number of convolution layers of UPM or UVPM, ResNet network and the fusion number of SA block and Conv2D block, we set up five comparison methods based on WSPCT3D, as shown in Table 1 and Table 2.</p>

Considering that our WSPCT3D series of methods are all evaluated as Lidar input, with Lidar scans being the signal some information was lost in the process of projecting 3D Lidar points cloud into 2D point clouds. As for Stereo images input signal, 3D point clouds are generated by 2D images through calculation of values of different perspectives and then projected as 2D point clouds.

<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">This paper studies the most recent 3D Weakly Supervised Object Detection algorithm and VS3D, after that a UVPM module is proposed to cover information from the point clouds itself when the input is the anchor pseudo point clouds, thus to reduce the frequency of rotations and corrections in the UPM [15] and to improve the accuracy and efficiency of the candidate boxes. The key point is that for the final classification output, we merge the ResNet local proposals with the global proposals from transformer Self-Attention. On The KITTI datasets, our WSPCT3D series method achieves the best results compared with existing weakly supervised methods. However, our method is limited to optimizing the student network, and the UVPM needs to be further improved. Therefore, in the future, we will include an instructor for the teacher network, and the Stereo version of the WSPCT3D.</p>
