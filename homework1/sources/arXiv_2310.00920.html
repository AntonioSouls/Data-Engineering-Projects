<p id="id4.id1" class="ltx_p">Monocular 3D object detection plays a crucial role in autonomous driving. However, existing monocular 3D detection algorithms depend on 3D labels derived from LiDAR measurements, which are costly to acquire for new datasets and challenging to deploy in novel environments. Specifically, this study investigates the pipeline for training a monocular 3D object detection model on a diverse collection of 3D and 2D datasets. The proposed framework comprises three components: (1) a robust monocular 3D model capable of functioning across various camera settings, (2) a selective-training strategy to accommodate datasets with differing class annotations, and (3) a pseudo 3D training approach using 2D labels to enhance detection performance in scenes containing only 2D labels.
With this framework, we could train models on a joint set of various open 3D/2D datasets to obtain models with significantly stronger generalization capability and enhanced performance on new dataset with only 2D labels.
We conduct extensive experiments on KITTI/nuScenes/ONCE/Cityscapes/BDD100K datasets to demonstrate the scaling ability of the proposed method.

Our proposed approach allows for algorithm training across multiple datasets with inconsistent camera settings. Furthermore, our method leverages 2D detection labels for training 3D detection algorithms, significantly reducing the annotation costs associated with 3D detection data. This approach enables the model to exhibit robust 3D detection capabilities when applied to new datasets that only provide 2D annotation labels.

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The pursuit of a comprehensive 3D understanding of dynamic environments stands as a cornerstone in the fields of robotics, autonomous driving, and augmented reality. Contemporary 3D detection algorithms leveraging LiDAR point clouds have shown remarkable performance, owing to the enhanced accuracy and density of these point clouds <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. Nevertheless, when contrasted with LiDAR, cameras are found to be cost-effective, power-efficient, and offer greater flexibility in installation. This has led to their widespread use in robots and autonomous vehicles, consequently making 3D detection via single cameras an increasingly compelling area of research within robotics and computer vision.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Over the last few years, monocular 3D object detection has experienced a significant evolution. Models employing Bird-Eye-View (BEV) representation have notably amplified potential in settings involving multi-sensor fusion, frequently encountered in autonomous driving scenarios. However, models utilizing front-view representation, the inherent representation of camera images, are not only faster but also simpler to deploy.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Despite these advancements, deploying monocular 3D object detection continues to grapple with major challenges, with data being a principal concern. When aiming to deploy a 3D detection model on a robot equipped with a single camera in a new environment, obtaining 3D data labeled with LiDAR points becomes a hurdle, and fine-tuning the model with data gathered from the robot is unattainable. It is, therefore, paramount that we depend on the pretrained model’s generalization capability with almost zero-shot fine-tuning. Furthermore, generating a model with robust generalization performance necessitates expansive datasets, which are considerably costly to compile.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">In light of these challenges, we put forth methodologies designed to augment the deployment of monocular 3D detection models through effective utilizations of existing data. Firstly, we explore the intricacies of training vision-based 3D detection models on a combined assortment of public 3D datasets with varied camera parameters. In doing so, we devise an output representation for the monocular 3D detection model that remains invariant to changes in camera parameters and, concurrently, establish a paradigm to train models on datasets with different labels. This approach could substantially boost model scales for individual researchers and developers.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Subsequently, we devise a strategy for training 3D models using 2D data. Several existing methods, such as MonoFlex<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>, annotate objects on the heatmap based on the 3D center projected on the image as opposed to the center of 2D bounding boxes. We formulate a training strategy that allows these models to fine-tune with 2D labels. This method enables us to fine-tune existing models with cheaper 2D-labeled data procured from on-site robots, thereby transferring 3D knowledge from public 3D datasets to the target environment. Throughout this paper, we will present experiments conducted to fine-tune a pre-trained model using KITTI 2D data and Cityscapes 2D data as evidence of the potential of our proposed method.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">Moreover, by integrating the two proposed methods, we can significantly expand our monocular 3D detection models by training them on a mix of multiple public 3D/2D datasets. This dramatically enlarges the data available during the training phase, thereby significantly enhancing the generalization ability of the resulting model.
We pre-train a model on a combined set of KITTI, nuScenes, ONCE, Cityscapes, and BDD100K datasets and then fine-tune it on the target dataset using only 2D labels. We subsequently test the model’s generalization ability on the target dataset.</p>

</h3>

<div id="S2.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Recent developments in monocular 3D detection can be broadly categorized into two methodologies: bird-eye-view (BEV) methods and perspective-view (PV) methods.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S2.SS1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Bird-Eye-View Methods:</span> These methods focus on conducting monocular 3D detection directly within 3D spaces, which simplifies the design of output representation. However, the main challenges arise in the transformation between perspective-view images and features in 3D coordinates. Pseudo-LiDAR represents a series of works that reconstruct 3D RGB-point clouds from monocular depth prediction models, subsequently applying LiDAR-based 3D object detectors to the reconstructed point cloud <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>. Another approach directly performs differentiable feature transformation, constructing 3D features from image features, enabling end-to-end training of 3D detection in 3D spaces <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>. These methods often delegate the scale-ambiguity problem to depth prediction sub-networks or attention modules. However, network inferencing in the BEV space heavily relies on 3D labels from LiDAR or direct supervision from LiDAR data, making it challenging to utilize existing 2D datasets or inexpensive 2D labeling tools. Consequently, researchers with limited access to 3D labeled data may encounter difficulties when deploying or fine-tuning networks in new environments.</p>

<p id="S2.SS1.p3.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S2.SS1.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Perspective-View Methods:</span> These methods, which conduct monocular 3D detection in the original perspective view, are more intuitive. Many one-stage monocular 3D object detection methods are built upon existing 2D object detection frameworks. The main challenge here lies in devising robust and precise encoding/decoding methods to bridge 3D predictions and dense PV features. Various techniques have been proposed, such as SS3D <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>, which adds additional 3D regression parameters, and ShiftRCNN <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>, which introduces an optimization scheme. Other works like M3DRPN <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>, D4LCN <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>, and YoloMono3D <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite> employ statistical priors in anchors to enhance 3D regression accuracy.

This means that the models are exposed to datasets with varying sets of annotations, particularly when employing a joint set of data labeled with different types.

As an anchor-free algorithm, MonoFlex predicts the center positions of target objects with a heat map.
Monoflex primarily consists of the following components: 2D detection, dimension estimation, orientation estimation, keypoint estimation and depth estimation ensemble.
The depth prediction z is simultaneously estimated from both geometry and direct prediction, and these predictions are adaptively ensembled to obtain the final result.

<p id="S3.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">During dataset training, some parts of the dataset are incompletely annotated. For instance, in the case of KITTI, certain categories like ”Tram” are not labeled. However, it is not appropriate to treat the data from KITTI as negative samples for the ”Tram” category. Therefore, each data point, in addition to its own annotations, is associated with the categories labeled in the respective dataset. This association provides supervision for the network’s classification output and is applied only to the categories with annotations.
Specifically, for different 3D datasets with varying labeled categories, each data frame stores the categories currently labeled in the dataset. When calculating the loss, we do not penalize (suppress) the detection predictions for unannotated categories.
In summary, this approach effectively handles the issue of incomplete annotations during dataset training. It ensures that only annotated categories influence the model’s training, and unannotated categories do not lead to erroneous model behavior. The training procedure is shown in Fig. <a href="#S3.F3" title="Figure 3 ‣ III-C Regulating 2D Labels of 2D Datasets for Pseudo 3D training ‣ III Methods ‣ Every Dataset Counts: Scaling up Monocular 3D Object Detection with Joint Datasets Training" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a>.</p>

<p id="S3.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In the Monoflex method, the center of the heatmap is determined by projecting the 3D center. For data with only 2D annotations, we have no direct means of generating supervision signals for the object’s 3D center.
Therefore, we need to find a way to generate 3D detection supervision information from 2D labels. We propose a novel method to train 3D detection algorithms solely relying on 2D detection labels. Specifically, we start by feeding data with only 2D annotations into a pre-trained 3D detection model and set a very low score threshold to enable the model to produce multiple detection results (including both 2D and 3D detection results). This step may include some erroneous or inaccurate detections.
Next, we use the 2D training labels from the new dataset to match them with the 2D detection results obtained in the previous step, filtering out erroneous or inaccurate detections to obtain pseudo 3D training labels. Finally, we reconstruct the ground truth heatmap and 2D detection map (as shown in Fig. <a href="#S3.F4" title="Figure 4 ‣ III-C Regulating 2D Labels of 2D Datasets for Pseudo 3D training ‣ III Methods ‣ Every Dataset Counts: Scaling up Monocular 3D Object Detection with Joint Datasets Training" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a>), and ultimately, we calculate the loss between the model predictions and the pseudo 3D labels only on the heatmap and 2D detection map.
The method of training a monocular 3D model using 2D annotated data is illustrated in Algorithm <a href="#alg1" title="Algorithm 1 ‣ III-C Regulating 2D Labels of 2D Datasets for Pseudo 3D training ‣ III Methods ‣ Every Dataset Counts: Scaling up Monocular 3D Object Detection with Joint Datasets Training" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>, we refer to it as <span id="S3.SS3.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Pseudo 3D Training with 2D Labels</span>.</p>

Quantitative results indicate that our method, when compared to the zero-shot approach, has shown significant improvements in various metrics, except for the PRSim metric (as we only focused on the yaw angle, considering pitch and roll angles to be 0). Specifically, in the ”Car” category, we observed an increase of 17.13% in AP, a 4.17% improvement in BEVCD, a 5.58% improvement in YamSim, a 5.97% improvement in SizeSim, and a remarkable 17.84% enhancement in DS.
In the ”Truck” category, AP, BEVCD, YawSim, SizeSim, and DS have improved by 112.55%, 1.16%, 8.36%, 17.17%, and 115.91%, respectively.
From these experimental results, we can also observe that our method demonstrates a more significant improvement in detection performance for categories with fewer instances in the dataset. This is due to the fact that the model has less knowledge about categories with fewer instances, leading to weaker generalization on new datasets compared to categories with more instances. After pseudo 3D learning using 2D labels on the new dataset, we achieved a substantial improvement in detection performance.</p>

<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we initially conducted research on models such as MonoFlex and developed strategies that are resilient to changes in camera intrinsics. These strategies allow the models to be trained on diverse datasets. Additionally, we designed a learning approach that enables monocular 3D detection models to acquire 3D detection knowledge based solely on 2D labels, even in datasets that only provide 2D training labels. Lastly, we carried out extensive experiments on a combination of datasets, including KITTI, nuScenes, Cityscapes, and others. The experimental results demonstrated the efficacy of our approach.

<p id="S5.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Despite its success, our work does have limitations. First, our method is currently applicable only to models that are insensitive to camera parameters, such as MonoFlex. For models where the influence of camera parameters cannot be disregarded.
Moreover, when encountering new categories in a novel dataset, the lack of relevant supervision from previous datasets may result in suboptimal detection performance for these new categories.
Overcoming these limitations demands continuous optimization and improvement of our approach.</p>
