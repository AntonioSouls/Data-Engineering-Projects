<p id="id15.id1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we present a methodology that uses an optical tactile sensor for efficient tactile exploration of embedded objects within soft materials. The methodology consists of an exploration phase, where a probabilistic estimate of the location of the embedded objects is built using a Bayesian approach. The exploration phase is then followed by a mapping phase which exploits the probabilistic map to reconstruct the underlying topography of the workspace by sampling in more detail regions where there are expected to be embedded objects. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the method, we tested our approach on an experimental setup that consists of a series of quartz beads located underneath a polyethylene foam that prevents direct observation of the configuration and requires the use of tactile exploration to recover the location of the beads. We show the performance of our methodology using ten different configurations of the beads where the proposed approach is able to approximate the underlying configuration. We benchmark our results against a random sampling policy.</p>

<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The sense of touch is fundamental for us humans to safely and robustly interact with our environment, it is arguably the most informative sense that we possess, even more so than the sense of sight. With a single touch of our hand almost instantly we are able to know if an object is hot or cold, if its surface is smooth or rough, if it is hard or soft and we can even form a quick mental map about the orientation and shape of the object. Without having to stop reading this paper you can reach your pocket or the closest drawer with your hand and get an accurate inventory of what is inside.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Robotics is still missing the reliability that our skin provides us in our day-to-day tasks. In the last decade, a great effort has been dedicated towards providing robots the ability to sense the environment through touch, more specifically with the use of optical tactile sensors. Examples of such sensors are GelSight <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>, which is able to provide high-resolution relief maps of object surfaces; Soft-Bubble <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite> which has shown to be able to classify, estimate the pose and track objects; and DenseTact 2.0 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>, capable of not only reconstruct the shape of the object but also provide a 6-axis wrench estimation.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Tactile information for robotic manipulation is particularly appealing when the sense of sight cannot provide reliable information to complete the task. Let us go back to the idea of forming an inventory of the objects that are in your pocket without having to take them out: the object of interest (rigid in nature) is occluded by the fabric (soft and deformable) and the quickest and often must intuitive way of figuring out what it is is by pinching and squeezing your fingers through the fabric.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">The implications of robots having this ability could be very significant. For industrial applications, robots would be able to classify packages at distribution centers without having to open them; for in-home care, robots that are equipped with this capacity could assist humans in retrieving objects hidden by blankets or within clothes in a more efficient and natural way. In medical applications, tactile sensation could aid physicians in assessing superficial anatomical structures providing reliable relief maps for further evaluation. Even for bionic prosthesis, forming a relief map and reproducing the haptic sensation on another part of the body of the user could partially retrieve this lost way of interaction with the world.</p>

<p id="S1.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The use of optical tactile sensors to estimate mechanical properties and differentiate heterogeneous objects has been explored in the past. Yuan et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite> used the GelSight sensor to estimate the hardness of everyday objects with different shapes, improving the object’s recognition that could provide information for an appropriate grasping strategy.

<p id="S1.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The above mentioned works show the efficacy of the use of optical tactile sensors to infer local properties of the objects. However, rich interactions with the environment require not only the capacity to detect local properties such as hardness, but also to gain global information of the object such as shape. One common choice for shape representation using haptic sensory information is through the use of implicit surfaces via Gaussian Processes (GP). Dragiev et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite> show the performance of implicit surfaces GP shape estimation using tactile information from a seven-degrees-of-freedom hand.</p>

<p id="S1.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Efficient shape reconstruction requires active and purposeful exploration of objects’ surfaces. Martins &amp; Ferreira <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite> implemented a haptic exploration in simulation that allowed a humanoid robot to reconstruct the boundary between two different materials using a Bayesian model. Jamali et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite> used a GP to probabilistically reconstruct the shape of the object driving the exploration based on the estimated boundaries of the object. A similar approach was shown to work by Yi et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>. A more recent work involving the use of GelSight was developed by Wang et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite> integrating the use of visual and tactile exploration with learned shape priors for 3D shape reconstruction. Liu et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite> demonstrated the application of optical tactile sensing along the entire surface of a finger for a three-finger robotic hand which enabled the recognition of a set of rigid objects with a single grasp.</p>

This method uses both visual and tactile information to reconstruct the relief map by loop closure of the two sensing modalities. This method requires direct visualization of the surface and has only been tested on rigid objects.</p>

<div id="S1.SS2.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS2.p4.1" class="ltx_p">As shown before, shape reconstruction has been extensively studied for rigid and homogeneous objects using tactile information. When the object is heterogeneous and/or deformable, previous work has been focused on gathering local information to obtain mechanical properties or estimate the presence of anomalies such as lumps in medical applications. To the best of our knowledge, simultaneous detection and mapping for heterogeneous and deformable objects has not been addressed in the past. This paper makes a significant contribution toward addressing this goal.</p>

<p id="S1.SS2.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Our main contributions in this paper are: first, different from other papers where tactile sensors are used to estimate the local presence of hard embedded objects in soft materials, we generate a probabilistic map of the location of such objects using a Bayesian approach in a larger region; second, we use this probabilistic map to drive the exploration of the workspace and approximate the shape of the embedded objects (heterogeneous medium), different from other papers where such shape reconstruction is done on rigid objects (homogeneous medium); finally, our method is able to detect and approximate the shapes of closely embedded and discontinuous objects within the soft material, independent of their continuity, relying solely on their spatial grouping within the workspace.

<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We propose a framework for efficient tactile exploration and mapping for embedded rigid objects within matrices of soft materials using an optical tactile sensor. The method first generates a map that indicates the presence of hard objects below the surface (exploration), followed by a more thorough interaction in the areas of interest for an approximate reconstruction of the underlying topography (mapping). The method is tested in an experimental setup that involves a series of bead clusters in a planar array which is then covered by a polyethylene foam.

<p id="S2.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The exploration phase of the method, which provides a probabilistic map of the location of the hard objects below the soft surface starts by sampling the workspace (<span id="S2.SS1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">E.1</span> in Figure <a href="#S2.F2" title="Figure 2 ‣ II Exploration and Mapping ‣ Embedded Object Detection and Mapping in Soft Materials Using Optical Tactile Sensing" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>). Assuming that initially there is no prior information of the location of the embedded objects, the sampling can be performed using any desired strategy (e.g. randomized sampling). It is desired to get a comprehensive understanding of the workspace avoiding oversampling some regions of the workspace or leaving some regions unexplored. A sampling plan that encourages a diversity of samples and maximizes coverage of the workspace is called a <span id="S2.SS1.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">space-filling</span> sampling plan. There exist many sampling plans that are considered space-filling, from which we have tested the Latin-hypercube sampling, Halton Sequence, and Sobol Sequences. Among these sampling strategies, including a randomized sampling plan, we found empirically that Sobol Sequences <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite> yields the best initialization for our experimental setup with eight initial samples to form the prior.

We have opted for the strategy involving the inclusion of a single training data point per cluster, as opposed to incorporating each individual pixel exhibiting deformation. This choice is driven by the need to address scenarios involving disjoint embedded objects and to facilitate predictions over larger areas of presence. By doing so, we prevent the Gaussian Process from optimizing for local information and encourage it to capture a more holistic understanding.</p>

In general, the discrepancy is difficult to compute exactly and there exist approximate methods to do so.

<p id="S3.p4.1" class="ltx_p">We are interested in reconstructing the underlying shape of the embedded objects. To accomplish this, it is necessary for the soft material to have relatively low stiffness against the sensor. In our case, DenseTact 2.0 has a Shore 00 hardness of 49.7, while the polyethylene foam has a Shore 00 hardness of 24.7 when pressed seven millimeters. For this reason, we limited our experiments to a single type of soft material. However, it is important to highlight that with a stiffer material, it is still possible to apply the exploration phase of our method as long as the sensor is able to detect the presence of the embedded materials as in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite> and <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>.</p>

Our proposed method has two distinct behaviors: before 14 to 16 samples after the prior, the loss decreases rapidly; after 14 to 16 samples after the prior, the loss continues decreasing but with a slower rate. As shown in Figure <a href="#S4.F7" title="Figure 7 ‣ IV Results and Discussion ‣ Embedded Object Detection and Mapping in Soft Materials Using Optical Tactile Sensing" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">7</span></a>, with sixteen samples after the prior, the probabilistic map has capture the main characteristic of the true distribution of the embedded objects. Different from our proposed method, the random policy more or less decreases at the same rate up to sixty additional samples after the prior. Eventually with enough samples, both strategies reach a similar loss. However, it is important to highlight that our proposed method has a better consistency as reflected in a tighter standard deviation.</p>

<p id="S4.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Since we are interested in forming a quick idea of the location of the embedded objects to sample the areas with a high probability for the mapping phase, it is valuable that our method can capture the main features with approximately 14 to 16 samples, with a lower uncertainty that a fully random sampling strategy.

Although DenseTact 2.0 provides a 6-axis wrench estimation over the entire sensor, when we incorporated this information in our method, due to some inconsistency and high variance of the measurements (either from issues in the calibration or undesired interactions between the soft material and the sensor) our method had a tendency to substantially favor depth information and for this reason, we dispensed with strength information.</p>

<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we have proposed a method for the exploration and mapping for heterogeneous materials, where hard embedded objects are present within a matrix of a soft and deformable material, situation in which sight cannot provide reliable or any kind of information and tactile sensing becomes the main mechanism of interaction. Our method has been motivated in applications such as package sorting, medical diagnosis, and restoration of haptic sensation in individuals with prostheses.</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The proposed framework is divided into two main phases. In the exploration phase, where a probabilistic map is generated by sampling the workspace and using a Gaussian process for classification we estimate the probability of the presence or absence of the hard embedded objects. The mapping phase exploits the probabilistic map generated by the exploration phase by sampling the areas of high probability of presence to reconstruct the underlying shape of the hard objects. We also present a strategy to obtain a prior of the location of the embedded objects using Sobol sequences when such prior is not available.</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p3.1" class="ltx_p">We validate our approach using an experimental setup that located a series of quartz beads in clusters underneath a polyethylene foam, and by using the optical tactile sensor DenseTact 2.0 together with the aid of a computer numerical control (CNC) machine we sample the workspace.</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Our empirical results show that our method outperforms a fully random policy on both the exploration and mapping phase. In the exploration phase, our method presents two distinct behaviors, before 14 to 16 samples after the prior there is a rapid decrease in both uncertainty and Cross-Entropy loss, followed by a continuous decrease of both the uncertainty and loss with a slower rate. It is valuable to see the rapid decrease in both loss and uncertainty with few samples to be able to transition to the mapping phase and focus the attention of the samples on the shape reconstruction aspect of the method. For the given size of the workspace, 16 samples (or equivalently a Cross-Entropy loss of around 0.45) were chosen to be the number of samples before switching to the mapping phase where we also demonstrate that our method outperforms the fully random policy. On both exploration and mapping phases, our proposed method presents a better consistency as compared to the random policy, shown by the smaller standard deviation across the ten different bead configurations.</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Immediate extensions include the post-processing of the reconstructed shape depending on the application: for item recognition in packages and home assistance, the reconstructed shape can be passed through a convolutional neural network to identify the different objects; for medical applications, the reconstructed shape can be displayed to the physician using virtual reality for assessment; and or haptic sensation, the reconstructed shape can be reproduced on another part of the prosthesis owner’s body. Future work could include the sampling and reconstruction of three-dimensional and/or curved surfaces and incorporate stress and force measurements into the method to obtain additional information of the embedded objects.</p>
