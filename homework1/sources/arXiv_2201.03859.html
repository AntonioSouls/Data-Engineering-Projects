<p id="id1.1a" class="ltx_p">Visible-infrared person re-identification (VI-ReID) has been challenging due to the existence of large discrepancies between visible and infrared modalities. Most pioneering approaches reduce intra-class variations and inter-modality discrepancies by learning modality-shared and ID-related features. However, an explicit modality-shared cue, <em id="id1.1a.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">i.e.,</em> body keypoints, has not been fully exploited in VI-ReID. Additionally, existing feature learning paradigms imposed constraints on either global features or partitioned feature stripes, which neglect the prediction consistency of global and part features. To address the above problems, we exploit Pose Estimation as an auxiliary learning task to assist the VI-ReID task in an end-to-end framework. By jointly training these two tasks in a mutually beneficial manner, our model learns higher quality modality-shared and ID-related features. On top of it, the learnings of global features and local features are seamlessly synchronized by Hierarchical Feature Constraint (HFC), where the former supervises the latter using the knowledge distillation strategy. Experimental results on two benchmark VI-ReID datasets show that the proposed method consistently improves state-of-the-art methods by significant margins. Specifically, our method achieves nearly 20<math id="id1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\%" display="inline"><semantics id="id1.1.m1.1a"><mo id="id1.1.m1.1.1" xref="id1.1.m1.1.1.cmml">%</mo><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="id1.1.m1.1b"><csymbol cd="latexml" id="id1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="id1.1.m1.1.1">percent</csymbol></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="id1.1.m1.1c">\%</annotation></semantics></math> mAP improvements against the state-of-the-art method on the RegDB dataset.

<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Person re-identification (ReID) aims at retrieving the same identity across multiple disjoint cameras, which has gained much attention from the recent computer vision community <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>. Most existing ReID methods focus on the matching between visible images, which are generally collected under good illumination conditions <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>.

<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">However, VI-ReID is a challenging problem due to large intra-class variations and modality discrepancies across different cameras. The former refers to identity’s appearance differences within a modality caused by poses, clothes, viewpoints, <em id="S1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">etc</em>. While, the latter denotes intrinsic differences between visible and infrared images caused by the spectrum of cameras. To reduce both discrepancies, the central research question in this field has always been seeking better ways to extract discriminative features for identity retrieval, which are ID-related and modality-invariant <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Despite the vigorous development of this field, we realize that most algorithms extract identity features in a heuristics manner with NO common view of what sort of features are specifically helpful for VI-ReID. To tackle this problem, we visualize the features extracted by several representative methods in Fig. 1, aiming to investigate how visual feature extractions evolved over the years to improve the performance of VI-ReID systems. Concretely, ZeroPad <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>, as the first work in VI-ReID, extracts features from random regions in an image. Additionally, for a specific identity, the features derived from two modalities share NO commonality. As a result, the mean Average Precision (mAP) score is far from satisfactory. Later, TSLFN <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite> horizontally partitions the backbone feature maps (global) into several stripes (local) and employs local-level constraints on each of them. Clearly, features derived by TSLFN cover more parts of the human body, compared to the global-level constraint-based method, <em id="S1.p3.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">e.g.,</em> ZeroPad. That might be the reason why its performance is significantly superior to that of ZeroPad. In the meantime, a baseline for VI-ReID (AGW <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>) inserts non-local attention blocks during the feature extraction, which enforces the features to be extracted from identity’s body instead of backgrounds. It reveals that <span id="S1.p3.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">attention-aware</span> features help to increase performance. Recently, a state-of-the-art approach (DDAG <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>) integrates both local-level and global-level constraints into an end-to-end framework. Compared to previous works, the features derived by DDAG are more fine-grained, which are not only shared by two modalities but distinguishable for different identities. Based on the above observations, a conclusion can be drawn: <span id="S1.p3.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">as more features from the human region (modality-shared) and attentive body part (ID-related) features are extracted, the retrieval performance improves consistently.</span> Benefiting from this conclusion, our algorithm extracts more features from body skeleton joints, which are not only ID-related but immune to modality changes. Therefore, we achieve over 10<math id="S1.p3.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\%" display="inline"><semantics id="S1.p3.1.m1.1a"><mo id="S1.p3.1.m1.1.1" xref="S1.p3.1.m1.1.1.cmml">%</mo><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S1.p3.1.m1.1b"><csymbol cd="latexml" id="S1.p3.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S1.p3.1.m1.1.1">percent</csymbol></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S1.p3.1.m1.1c">\%</annotation></semantics></math> mAP improvements against DDAG on the challenging SYSU-MM01 dataset at <span id="S1.p3.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">All-search</span> setting.</p>

<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Having depicted the visual features that are conducive to VI-ReID, the next question is: how can we extract them effectively. It is noted that body skeleton points are explicit modality-shared cues and the features describing certain skeleton points are ID-related. In light of this, in the paper, we aim to facilitate the extraction of discriminative features for identity retrieval with the aid of the pose estimation task. However, making effective use of the pose information for cross-modality ReID does not seem easy, though it has recently appeared to be exploited in some single-modality ReID works <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>, where only visible images are involved. Earlier methods <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite> utilize detected body joints to segment <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite> or align <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite> body regions in order to cope with human pose changes. After the calibration of body parts, different body parts need to be stitched, which usually yields unrealistic transformed visual features. If we move to the cross-modality setting, the transformed errors would be further magnified due to the huge discrepancy between the two modalities. Alternatively, another group of methods employ the body keypoints information to refine ID-related feature maps either by means of highlighting discriminative body regions <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite> or complementing human appearance features <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>. Although pose-assisted features are proved to improve the feature discriminability under the single-modality setting, they are rigidly based on the outputs of off-the-shelf pose estimators. However, such a blind trust in the pre-trained pose estimators will lead to a poor re-identification performance if the gap between the source domain and the target domain of the pose estimator is huge. Therefore, employing pose information in the VI-ReID task is extremely challenging due to the massive gap between visible images (source domain) and infrared images (target domain). To highlight the problem, we extend two state-of-the-art pose-guided single-modality person ReID methods <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite> to the VI-ReID task and the results turn out that the best performance in the mAP score <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite> only reaches 42.19<math id="S1.p4.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\%" display="inline"><semantics id="S1.p4.1.m1.1a"><mo id="S1.p4.1.m1.1.1" xref="S1.p4.1.m1.1.1.cmml">%</mo><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S1.p4.1.m1.1b"><csymbol cd="latexml" id="S1.p4.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S1.p4.1.m1.1.1">percent</csymbol></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S1.p4.1.m1.1c">\%</annotation></semantics></math>, which is far from satisfaction due to the inadequate usage of the pose information (more results and comparisons are provided in Section <a href="#S4.SS3" title="IV-C Comparison with pose-guided single-modality person ReID ‣ IV Experiments ‣ On Exploring Pose Estimation as an Auxiliary Learning Task for Visible-Infrared Person Re-identification" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag"><span class="ltx_text">IV-C</span></span></a>).</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">To solve the above problems, we propose a two-stream VI-ReID framework, where modality-shared and ID-related features for identity retrieval are extracted by means of learning an auxiliary task (pose estimation) and the main task (person ReID) jointly. Unlike previous works, which rely dramatically on the off-the-shelf pose estimators, pose features are adaptively adjusted to facilitate the ReID task in our work. Additionally, apart from ID-related constraints, an extra constraint is imposed on the pose estimation branch, ensuring that not only body skeleton points are precisely estimated but also the ID-related information are fully embedded in feature maps, <em id="S1.p5.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">i.e.,</em> at both local and global levels. Despite the significant improvements obtained by the horizontal-divided feature constraints <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite> in the VI-ReID task <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>, the learning of individual striped features is generally independent and its discriminability consistency with global backbone features is neglected. To this end, we propose a Hierarchical Feature Constraint (HFC), in the paper, which bonds the learnings of global features and local ones via the knowledge distillation strategy. Concretely, predictions of backbone features serve as “soft-target” to supervise the learning of partitioned feature stripes, hence preserving the discriminability consistency of global features and local ones.</p>

Such combined training encourages the pose branch to learn features that are beneficial to the person ReID task. While pose features are learned to adapt to the ReID task in the work, only ID-related constraints are imposed on the fused features, which ignores the quality of pose features from the individual branch. Given the above concerns, the auxiliary pose estimation task designed for single-modality ReID cannot perform well in the VI-ReID task. In other words, how to enable the pose information to facilitate the VI-ReID task has not been elaborately investigated.</p>

<p id="S4.SS3.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Firstly, the VI-ReID task is considered as the single-modality person ReID task with two different types of images. For each modality, a modality-specific pose-assisted feature extractor is trained. During the inference, features of query set (IR images) and gallery set (RGB images) are derived by the corresponding feature extractor to conduct the cross-modality person retrieval.

<div id="S5.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We have proposed a novel two-stream VI-ReID framework, where modality-shared and ID-related features for identity retrieval are extracted by means of learning an auxiliary task (pose estimation) and the main task (person ReID) simultaneously. By imposing pose estimation and ReID constraints on the Pose Estimation branch at the same time, both modality-shared and ID-related are fully embedded on each feature stripe. Apart from learning discriminative features at the local level, we also propose a Hierarchical Feature Constraint to bond the learning of global features with local ones by employing the knowledge distillation strategy to ensure the discriminability consistency. The proposed framework achieves a new state-of-the-art on VI-ReID benchmarks in terms of the rank-1 accuracy and the mAP score.</p>
