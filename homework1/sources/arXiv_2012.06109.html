<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">This paper presents a novel method for 3D human pose and shape estimation from images with sparse views, using joint points and silhouettes, based on a parametric model. Firstly, the parametric model is fitted to the joint points estimated by deep learning-based human pose estimation. Then, we extract the correspondence between the parametric model of pose fitting and silhouettes on 2D and 3D space. A novel energy function based on the correspondence is built and minimized to fit parametric model to the silhouettes. Our approach uses sufficient shape information because the energy function of silhouettes is built from both 2D and 3D space. This also means that our method only needs images from sparse views, which balances data used and the required prior information. Results on synthetic data and real data demonstrate the competitive performance of our approach on pose and shape estimation of the human body.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Estimation of 3D human body models from images is an important but challenging task in computer vision. In many practical fields, for instance, video games, VR/AR, E-commerce and biomedical research, 3D human body models are needed and play vital roles. However, the human body in real scenes naturally exhibits many challenging properties, such as non-rigid motion, clothes and occlusion. These factors make it difficult to accurately and efficiently estimate the 3D human body model from images, and many approaches have been proposed to obtain 3D human body models during the past decades.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Time-of-flight cameras, and other types of hardware solutions, can provide depth information and have been one of the solutions to the reconstruction of 3D human bodies  <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>, <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>, <a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>, <a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite>. More specifically, depth cameras are utilized to capture RGB images and the corresponding depth images of the scenes. The 3D meshes of each view can be computed from the RGB-D images and the complete 3D model can be estimated by fusing the 3D meshes of each view. The process of fusion is often implemented using the Iterated Closest Point (ICP) algorithm  <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite> or other similar improved algorithms, which often are computation-consuming. Since these methods only can handle rigid scenes well, research on dynamic scenes has been explored <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>, <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>, <a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>, <a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite>. However, compared to ordinary cameras, the cameras with depth sensors are still expensive and calibration of the depth camera can also be complicated.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">With the development of deep learning architectures, 3D human body models can be estimated by optimization- <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite> or regression-based methods <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>. For methods based on optimization, prior information, for example, human poses and silhouettes can be estimated by deep neural networks. The 3D model can then be obtained by fitting the parametric human body model to the prior information. The regression-based methods use deep neural networks to directly estimate the parameters of the given parametric human body model from images, by training the deep neural networks<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>. Both approaches have been explored extensively and have achieved good performance in 3D human body reconstruction. However, regression-based methods require a large amount of data to train the neural network. This often requires much work and it is difficult, and sometimes expensive, to generate the dataset. Compared to regression-based methods, the human pose estimation and semantic segmentation based on deep neural networks have been well developed and many pre-trained models can be utilized directly. This means that prior information in optimization-based methods can be more easily estimated through deep neural networks. For these reasons, our choice of method, proposed in this paper, is also optimization-based.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, the goal is to estimate the 3D human body from images. Since this is a very complex problem and one single image can only provide limited prior information, a number of images taken from different view-points are used in our paper. The human pose estimation based on deep neural network  <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite> is adopted to estimate the joint points of the human body in the multiple-view images. The Skinned multi-person linear model (SMPL)  <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>, which is widely used in the methods based on optimization, is the parametric human body model also used in our paper. Then, an energy function is established based on the predicted joint points and the SMPL. By minimizing the energy function, we can achieve an estimated 3D human body model which has a pose consisted with the observed images. Afterwards, the silhouettes are exploited to improve the shape of the estimated human body model. Through building the correspondence edges between the estimated human body model and the given silhouettes from 2D and 3D space, the energy function for the silhouettes is constructed. The shape parameters of the human body model are obtained by optimizing the energy function. The final 3D human body model is generated by the estimated pose and shape parameters after pose fitting and shape fitting. The experiments on synthetic data and a public real dataset validate the performance of our method.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">In summary, the contribution of our method consists of two parts. Firstly, an improved energy function for silhouettes is constructed from 2D and 3D perspectives to estimate the parameters of shape. Secondly, a small number of images (four in our experiments) from different views are applied in our method, which balances the number of images and the prior information.</p>

<div id="S2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In order to obtain 3D human body models from images, researchers have explored a large number of methods from hardware and software during the past decades. These work can be basically categorized according to whether a parametric human body model is adopted in the methods. For the approaches which do not depend on any parametric human body model, the 3D reconstruction of the human body is mainly implemented from RGB-D images captured by depth cameras. In contrast to the above methods, the approaches based on a parametric human body model often attempt to estimate the pose and shape from common RGB images. We call the two categories <em id="S2.p1.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">parametric model-free</em> and <em id="S2.p1.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">parametric model based</em> methods, respectively.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Parametric model-free methods often reconstruct 3D human body models from RGB-D images, which means that these methods often require depth cameras. KinectFusion <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite> was the typical work which used a Kinect depth camera to reconstruct the 3D meshes of an indoor scene with static objects. However, KinectFusion was mainly aiming at reconstructing rigid objects rather than dynamic scene like a moving human body. In order to tackle non-rigid reconstruction, DynamicFusion <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>, VolumeDeform <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>, KillingFusion <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite> were proposed over the next several years. These methods can handle reconstruction of non-rigid and moving objects, but they typically only obtain good performance for partial body or small slow moving objects. Yu et al. proposed BodyFusion <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite> and DoubleFusion <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite> to reconstruct the whole 3D human body model for moving persons with high accuracy. One common thing in all of the above work is that they utilize one single Kinect to recover the 3D human body model. In order to improve the accuracy more, some methods based on multiple Kinects <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite> were proposed to reconstruct 3D geometry, which was more complicated to set than single a Kinect. In addition, commercial depth <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite> cameras have also been used as a tool to reconstruct 3D models. The core idea of the parametric-model free methods is that they utilized depth cameras to capture RGB-D images and fused the meshes of each view to obtain the final 3D model. Although the work has achieved good performance for 3D reconstruction of human body, cameras with depth sensor are still inconvenient in many applications.</p>

<div id="S2.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Parametric model based methods often tackle the problem through fitting a parametric human body model to prior information of the given images. The parametric human body model is often trained by a dataset and is defined as a function of variables which can represent prior information like pose and shape. The parametric models such as SCAPE <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite> and SMPL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite> have been used in many methods. Recently, an improved model called SMPL-X was proposed by considering the motion of face and hands <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>. With the development of deep learning, some methods exploited deep neural networks to regress the parameters of the parametric model, hence we call them regression based methods. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>, the pose and shape parameters of the SMPL model were estimated by training a deep encoder network. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>, the loss function of mesh was added to further finetune the mesh of the 3D model. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>, the pose and shape parameters were separately trained in two pipelines to make the result better. Nikos et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite> used the output of deep neural network to initialize the SMPL model and then supervise the training process of deep neural networks through the SMPL model. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>, texture was utilized to capitalizes on the appearance constancy of images from different viewpoints. Although these methods have achieved competitive results, collecting datasets for training is still cumbersome work and training the network is also time-consuming. Another way to solve the problem is to fit the parametric human body model to prior information through optimizing an error function (optimization based methods). Early work <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite> used SCAPE to estimate the articulated pose and non-rigid shape. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>, silhouettes and joint points were manually obtained and the SCAPE model was fitted to the priori clues to estimate the parameters of SCAPE. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>, RGB-D images were utilized to estimate the parameters of SCAPE model. Xu et al.<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite> scanned a template as the parametric model and used it to fit the prior information through optimizing an energy function. Bogo et al <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite> proposed a method called SMPLify in which the joint points were predicted by human pose estimation based on a deep neural network, and then SMPL was fitted to the estimated joint points. Moreover, silhouettes <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite> and multiple images with different views <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite> were introduced as prior information for the SMPL model. Overall, optimization based methods are often easier to implement, since it is unnecessary to create datasets and to do training.</p>

<p id="S4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this section, the experiments to evaluate our proposed method are presented. We firstly introduced the datasets which were used in the experiments. Then, we discussed the effect of joint points on pose fitting and the influence of silhouettes on shape fitting, respectively. Besides, we also evaluated the pose fitting and shape fitting on the final estimation. Finally, we compared our method to several previous approaches on the datasets to validate the advantage of our approach.</p>

<p id="S4.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">To evaluate our approach for a variety of poses and shapes, we generated a synthetic dataset and also used a public real dataset. The synthetic dataset consisted of 50 male and 50 female 3D human bodies which were created by the SMPL model. We set all the human bodies as ”A” pose through giving the same pose parameters of the SMPL model, while the shape of each human body was different by varying the shape parameters of the SMPL model. For each 3D human body, we used four cameras from different views to project the 3D model into four 2D images. Since the 3D joint points of the SMPL model relied on the pose and shape parameters, the ground truth of 2D joint points and silhouettes can also be obtained when we projected the SMPL model.</p>

Each sequence was captured by eight cameras in an indoor scene. Four images which are taken by the 2nd, 4th, 6th and 8th cameras are adopted in our experiments. Note that there are two marches and squats in the dataset, so we evaluate the results of march1 and squat2, i.e, the experiments are implemented based on eight image sequences. We predicted the bounding box the person through Cornernet <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>, and then estimated the joint points of the dataset through the method in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>. In terms of the silhouettes, the ground truth was given in this dataset. However, the silhouettes can be extracted through threshold and filter since the background can be easily removed. In practice, semantic segmentation can be used for silhouettes extraction. Silhouette segmentation is not the key problem in our method,
So we directly use the ground truth of silhouettes like <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>.</p>

<p id="S4.SS1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">The metric for quantitatively comparison is the intersection over union (IoU) between the ground truth (GT) of silhouettes and the silhouettes of the estimated human body model from multiple views. Note that the GT of silhouettes here is used for computing the IoU, which has no relationship with the silhouettes in the optimization. This is because the silhouettes for optimzation can use the GT of silhouettes or be obtained by some other segmentation algorithms.</p>

The IoU of silhouette overlap is computed based on the silhouette of the projected 3D human body model and the corresponding ground truth of silhouette. The IoU for SMPLify is calculated based on one view-point, while the IoU of the other methods is based on four view-points. Although the results of some samples for SMPLify are better, the accuracy of our method is still higher than the results of the other three methods for the most samples in the dataset. Since SMPLify only adopts one image, the optimization is not sensitive to the initialization, which is the reason that the results of SMPLify on some samples are better. Compared to the SMPLify4 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>, our method introduced silhouette after the joint points optimization, and thus, the results of our method are better on the synthetic dataset. In addtion, for VideoAvatar <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite> which also uses silhouettes, our results are still better. The reason could be that the energy function of silhouette in VideoAvatar was only built from 3D space. In VideoAvatar, the 3D model was acquired from a video stream containing 120 frames from multiple viewpoints. By contrast, the improved energy function of silhouettes in our method considers both 2D and 3D, which ensures that our method have good performance only using four images.</p>

Note that the IoU of SMPLify is also computed based on four images to reflect the accuracy of the 3D models. We can see that our method obtains higher accuracy than the other three methods for the most samples in this image sequence. The results of SMPLify are the worst because only joint points from one single image are used as prior information. The results of SMPLify4 and VideoAvarta are almost the same because VideoAvatar requires enough number of images from different views. Furthermore, we also give the average of IoU of silhouettes overlap for the eight different actions in the real dataset in Table 2. It is shown from this table that our method achieves the best performance comparing to other three previous methods because the IoU of our method is the highest. The results of SMPLify are worst, while the SMPLify4 and VideoAvatar have almost the same performance and they are better than SMPLify. The results of <span id="S4.SS3.p3.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Handstand</span> are not good because the pose estimation for the images in the sequence is not good.

<p id="S4.SS3.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Several images from <span id="S4.SS3.p4.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Swing</span>, <span id="S4.SS3.p4.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Crane</span>, <span id="S4.SS3.p4.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Samba</span> and <span id="S4.SS3.p4.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Bouncing</span> are shown in Fig. <a href="#S4.F9" title="Figure 9 ‣ 4.3 Comparison to previous approaches ‣ 4 Experiments ‣ A novel joint points and silhouette-based method to estimate 3D human pose and shape" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">9</span></a>. In the figure, we illustrate one frame from each above sequence and give the qualitative results of the three previous methods and our method from one view. We can see from the figure that the shape of our method gives a better fit to the original images, which can be seen from the parts that are zoomed in. More specifically, the <span id="S4.SS3.p4.1.5" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Bouncing</span> results of SMPLify are not correct. This is because using only a single RGB image gives a too high uncertainty concerning the spatial information. Compared to SMPLigy4 and VideoAvatar, which are shown in the second and third columns in Fig. <a href="#S4.F9" title="Figure 9 ‣ 4.3 Comparison to previous approaches ‣ 4 Experiments ‣ A novel joint points and silhouette-based method to estimate 3D human pose and shape" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">9</span></a>, the shapes of our method provides a better fit because to the original images. This demonstrates the effectiveness to use the energy function based on silhouettes from 2D and 3D space. Therefore, our method achieves a good estimation not only for the pose but also for the shape of the human body. We also provide the results obtained by our method from the other three views in Fig. <a href="#S4.F9" title="Figure 9 ‣ 4.3 Comparison to previous approaches ‣ 4 Experiments ‣ A novel joint points and silhouette-based method to estimate 3D human pose and shape" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">9</span></a>. It demonstrates that the results from other views are correct, which means that the 3D model estimated by our method has better accuracy.</p>

<div id="S5.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We have proposed a novel method for human pose and shape estimation using joint points and silhouettes based on SMPL model from four images with different view-points. SMPL model provides better representation about the 3D human body and the prior information including joint points and silhouettes gives strong cues for human body estimation. Our method consists of two steps: joint points based fitting and silhouettes based fitting.The joint points of the images were firstly predicted by deep learning-based human pose estimation. Then, the pose and shape parameters of a SMPL model were estimated by fitting the SMPL model to the joint points of the four images simultaneously. Furthermore, we identified the corresponding points on the edge of silhouettes and SMPL model to build a novel energy function from 2D and 3D space.</p>

<p id="S5.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The shape parameters of SMPL were improved by minimizing the novel energy function. Our method not only estimated the pose of the human body, but also obtained better shape appearance of the human body.
The experiments on synthetic and real data indicate that our approach can obtain better human body shape comparing to the previous methods.
The limitation of our method is that we strongly depend on the estimated joint points and silhouettes, which may result in that the estimation of pose and shape is not correct when the joint points or silhouettes are not predicted correctly. In addition, the texture of the images is not mapped to the 3D model, which makes the appearance not realistic enough in some cases. Overall, our method can be used in many practical fields such as VR video games or biomedical research.</p>
