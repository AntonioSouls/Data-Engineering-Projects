<p id="id2.id1" class="ltx_p">Current deep neural network approaches for camera pose estimation rely on scene structure for 3D motion estimation, but this decreases the robustness and thereby makes cross-dataset generalization difficult. In contrast, classical approaches to structure from motion estimate 3D motion utilizing optical flow and then compute depth. Their accuracy, however, depends strongly on the quality of the optical flow. To avoid this issue, direct methods have been proposed, which separate 3D motion from depth estimation, but compute 3D motion using only image gradients in the form of normal flow. In this paper, we introduce a network <span id="id2.id1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">NFlowNet</span>, for normal flow estimation which is used to enforce robust and direct constraints. In particular, normal flow is used to estimate relative camera pose based on the cheirality (depth positivity) constraint. We achieve this by formulating the optimization problem as a differentiable cheirality layer, which allows for end-to-end learning of camera pose. We perform extensive qualitative and quantitative evaluation of the proposed DiffPoseNet’s sensitivity to noise and its generalization across datasets. We compare our approach to existing state-of-the-art methods on KITTI, TartanAir, and TUM-RGBD datasets.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The ability to localize is imperative for applications in mobile robotics, and solutions based on vision are often the preferred choice because of size, weight, power constraints and the availability of robust localization methods. Many
mathematical frameworks and deep learning approaches have been developed for the problem of visual localization <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib40" title="" class="ltx_ref">40</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite> under the umbrella of Visual Odometry (VO) or Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM). However, their performance is subpar for commonly encountered challenging conditions in-the-wild that involve changing lighting, scenes with textureless regions, and dynamic objects.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Classical approaches <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite> for localization rely either on sparse feature correspondences between images or on the computation of dense motion fields (optical flow). One of the difficulties in optical flow estimation is bias due to noise <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>. For example, if in a patch there are more gradients in one direction than another, their estimated optical flow will be biased towards the dominant direction. Even though over the past decade many learning-based approaches have proposed to improve optical flow estimation, this behavior still persists in optical flow approaches. This is demonstrated in Fig. <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ DiffPoseNet: Direct Differentiable Camera Pose Estimation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>, which shows the errors produced by the normal flow algorithm presented in this paper in comparison to three optical flow algorithms from the literature. As can be seen, all flow algorithms have large errors in regions of non-uniform gradient distributions.</p>

Bottom Row: enlarged endpoint error map of the region highlighted in red in the top row. The optical flow is due to the camera undergoing translation parallel to the wall. It has large errors in regions of non-uniform gradient directions. Notably, on the bricks of rectangular shape, there are many more (vertical) gradients due to the horizontal edges than (horizontal) gradients due to vertical edges, and this causes erroneous flow estimation. Similarly, on the edges of the niches, where there is only one gradient direction, there is error. <span id="S1.F1.6.2.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">All the images in this paper are best viewed in color on a computer screen at a zoom of 200%.</span></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">To this end, the pioneers of the field remarked on the observation that the projection of optical flow on the image gradient direction is resilient to the bias and can be computed robustly. This projection is called the <span id="S1.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">normal flow</span>. Over the past few decades, a number of methods have been proposed that use the spatial gradient directly for 3D motion recovery. These methods are commonly called direct methods. In principle, such methods are robust and computationally cheaper than flow-based feature based approaches as they use the image brightness directly. However, despite the advantages of the normal flow formulation, the computational methods to estimate normal flow have not been robust enough to allow deployment in the wild. Thus, optical flow has been the go-to representation for ego-motion estimation, supported in recent years by the high accuracy and speed of deep learning algorithms <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>, <a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>, <a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>]</cite>. To improve the robustness of camera pose estimation (ego-motion), we propose the first normal flow network <span id="S1.p3.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">NFlowNet</span>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Further, to estimate pose independent of scene structure from normal flow, direct approaches utilize minimal constraints.
When optical flow or correspondence are available, pose is estimated using the depth-independent epipolar constraint. However different from these 2D measurements, normal flow is 1D and thus depth cannot be eliminated from the equations relating it to scene geometry and 3D motion. Not making assumptions about the scene structure,
the only constraint that can be imposed on the scene, is the depth positivity <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>]</cite> or cheirality constraint <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib51" title="" class="ltx_ref">51</a>]</cite>. Cheirality states that the scene has to be in front of the camera for it to be imaged, and thus the depth has to be positive. This constraint when enforced on normal flow can be utilized to estimate camera pose without making assumptions on scene depth or shape. Since the cheirality condition is an inequality constraint and hence is not differentiable, until recently it was not possible to employ it in a deep learning pipeline. To this end, we utilize the differentiable programming paradigm <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite> implemented with the implicit differentiation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite> framework to reformulate the cheirality optimization into a differentiable layer and hence train our pose network in an end-to-end fashion.</p>

<div id="S2.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Several works have developed direct methods that use normal flow for pose estimation.
The idea is that normal flow can be interpreted as “the projection of optical flow on the gradient direction.” Thus, given a normal flow vector, the optical flow is constrained to a half-plane <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. If the 3D motion is only due to translation, this constrains the focus of expansion, i.e., the intersection of the translation axis with the image plane <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>]</cite> to a half plane.
Based on this concept, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite> proposed different algorithms to solve for the case of translation only,
and <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib42" title="" class="ltx_ref">42</a>]</cite> analyzed the method’s stability in the presence of small rotations.
Modeling the scene as piece-wise planar, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite> solved for 3D motion and calibration <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>, and <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite> added constraints for combining multiple flow fields.
Not making depth assumptions, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite> developed constraints on the sign of normal flow, which geometrically separate the rotational and translational flow components and can be implemented as pattern matching.
Others proposed techniques for separating 3D motion components by searching for lines in the image, where certain 3D motion components cancel out <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib41" title="" class="ltx_ref">41</a>, <a href="#bib.bib53" title="" class="ltx_ref">53</a>]</cite>.
Recently <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite> modeled the cheirality constraint by approximating it with a smooth function, which allowed the use of modern optimization techniques.
The method first solves for 3D motion from normal flow, and then refines using a regularization defined on depth. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed pipeline
outperforms other flow based approaches. Inspired by these findings, we follow a similar pipeline, but we develop the constraints within a neural network approach.

However, these methods require real-world ground truth poses which is often difficult to obtain. In order to alleviate the need of ground truth data, self-supervised VO was proposed. SfMLearner<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib54" title="" class="ltx_ref">54</a>]</cite> learns depth and pose simultaneously by minimizing photometric loss between warped and input image. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib52" title="" class="ltx_ref">52</a>]</cite> and <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib55" title="" class="ltx_ref">55</a>]</cite> extend this idea to joint estimation of pose, depth and optical flow. Learning-based models suffer from generalization issues when tested on images from a new environment. Most of the VO models are trained and tested on the same dataset. Most recently, TartanVO <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib47" title="" class="ltx_ref">47</a>]</cite> addresses generalization issues by incorporating the camera intrinsics directly into the model and training with a large amount of data. Recent advances in differentiable optimization layers ( or differentiable programming) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite> has enabled a new generation of generalizable pose learning approaches. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite> embeds an Epipolar geometric constraint into a self-supervised learning framework via bi-level optimization of camera pose and optical flow. BlindPnP <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite> embeds geometric model fitting algorithms (PnP algorithm, RANSAC) into implicit differentiation layers. All the above work focus on reconstructing the structure (either through network or optimization) and/or optical flow correspondences for estimating camera motion. In our work, we address robust pose estimation by depending only on structure-less cheirality constraints and normal flow. Finally, we utilize the concepts of best of both-worlds to enable speedup using data prior and novel data generalization from mathematical optimization.</p>

<div id="S3.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The network architecture is illustrated in Fig. <a href="#S2.F2" title="Figure 2 ‣ 2.2 Learning-based Camera Pose Estimation ‣ 2 Related Work ‣ DiffPoseNet: Direct Differentiable Camera Pose Estimation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>. It consists of
<span id="S3.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">NFlowNet</span>, a network for estimating normal flow (Section <a href="#S4" title="4 NFlowNet for Normal Flow Prediction ‣ DiffPoseNet: Direct Differentiable Camera Pose Estimation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a>),
which then is used for self-adaptive camera pose estimation (or odometry estimation) (Section <a href="#S5" title="5 Self-Adaptive Pose Estimation from Normal Flow ‣ DiffPoseNet: Direct Differentiable Camera Pose Estimation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5</span></a>).
The camera pose estimation proceeds in three steps. First we <span id="S3.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">initialize</span> the PoseNet using supervised training with successive images as input (Sec. <a href="#S5.SS1" title="5.1 PoseNet for Initializing Pose Estimation ‣ 5 Self-Adaptive Pose Estimation from Normal Flow ‣ DiffPoseNet: Direct Differentiable Camera Pose Estimation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5.1</span></a>). Next, pose is estimated using differentiable optimization by embedding a cheirality constraint defined on normal flow (Sec. <a href="#S5.SS2" title="5.2 Differentiable Cheirality Layer for Fine Pose Estimation ‣ 5 Self-Adaptive Pose Estimation from Normal Flow ‣ DiffPoseNet: Direct Differentiable Camera Pose Estimation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5.2</span></a>). This way, simliar to the classic SfM approach, pose is <span id="S3.p1.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">estimated independent of depth</span>. In a last step, the pose in PoseNet is refined through a self-supervised refinement loss by using the pose estimates from the <span id="S3.p1.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">cheirality constraint</span> to minimize the error in normal flow.</p>

Since this constraint alone is not sufficient to determine
two-dimensional image motion, additional constraints need to be introduced. Traditionally, variational methods combining multiple global smoothness assumptions, have been the dominant approach for optical flow estimation, and more recently they have been replaced by deep learning algorithms.
However, these methods tend to perform subpar on regions with little features or repeated texture due to the strong reliance on the training dataset, and in boundary regions
due to oversmoothing, especially when the size of the flow varies significantly in the image. Computing normal flow solely on spatio-temporal derivatives, is unreliable and prone to errors. Hence, we propose a novel Normal flow network called <span id="S4.p4.2.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">NFlowNet</span>.</p>

<div id="S5.SS2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">To enable self-supervised learning of continuous pose (given a initialization value), we propose to utilize the cheirality constraint or depth positivity constraint, which states that all world points have to be in front of the camera, i.e., have positive depth.
This condition has been classically used in structure from motion problems to disambiguate the physically possible camera poses from the set of computed solutions.
The main reason for utilizing the cheirality rather than the acclaimed epipolar constaint or scene planarity constraint is due to the minimalism in the assumptions.
Since in our formulation, depth positivity is enforced using the normal flow, which in-turn makes minimal assumptions about the scene structure, our formulation generalizes to novel scenes with remarkable accuracy (Sec. <a href="#S6.SS2.SSS2" title="6.2.2 Comparison of Pose Estimation ‣ 6.2 Analysis of Experimental Results ‣ 6 Experiments ‣ DiffPoseNet: Direct Differentiable Camera Pose Estimation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">6.2.2</span></a>).</p>

We achieve competitive results, because TUM RGBD is difficult for monocular vision methods due to rolling shutter, motion blur and large rotation. This is where pure geometric constraints show a massive advantage. We believe our work can further be improved by compensating for rolling shutter in the differential layer and we see this as a potential future research direction. It is important to stress that our method was trained on the TartanAir dataset and tested directly on other datasets to highlight cross-dataset generalization without any fine-tuning or re-training.</p>

The test sequences were selected such that they do not overlap with the training sets in the deep learning models used for comparison. Note that, similar to TartanVO, our training is performed only on TartanAir and do not perform any fine-tuning or re-training on KITTI dataset. Regardless, we perform competitive to other approaches that are trained/fine-tuned on similar data, thus demonstrating our cross-dataset generalization.</p>

Observe that, our <span id="S6.SS2.SSS3.p3.4.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">DiffPoseNet</span> is more resilient to noise and fails “more gracefully” compared to other methods. We owe this robustness to the lack of strong constraints used in our approach as compared to other methods that either rely on strong features or strong photometric consistency. We believe that carefully crafted optimization problems can lead to robust pose estimation neural networks that generalize well to novel datasets while being robust to noise, a capability rarely seen in most state-of-the-art methods <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">38</a>]</cite>.</p>

<div id="S7.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S7.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this work, we combined the best of both worlds from classical direct camera pose estimation approaches and deep learning taking advantage of differentiable programming concepts. Specifically, we addressed the problem of estimating relative camera pose using a sequence of images. To achieve this, we introduced the <span id="S7.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">DiffPoseNet</span> framework. As part of this framework, we introduced a normal flow network called <span id="S7.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">NFlowNet</span>, that predicts accurate motion fields under challenging scenarios and is more resilient to noise and bias. Furthermore, we proposed a differentiable cheirality layer that when coupled with <span id="S7.p1.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">NFlowNet</span> can estimate robust and accurate relative camera poses.</p>

<div id="S7.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S7.p2.2" class="ltx_p">A comprehensive qualitative and quantitative evaluation was provided on the challenging datasets: TartanAir, TUM-RGBD and KITTI. We demonstrated the efficacy, accuracy and robustness of our method under noisy scenarios and cross-dataset generalization without any fine-tuning and/or re-training . Our approach outperforms the previous state-of-the-art approach. Particularly, NFlowNet can output accurate up to 6<math id="S7.p2.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\times" display="inline"><semantics id="S7.p2.1.m1.1a"><mo id="S7.p2.1.m1.1.1" xref="S7.p2.1.m1.1.1.cmml">×</mo><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S7.p2.1.m1.1b"><times id="S7.p2.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S7.p2.1.m1.1.1"></times></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S7.p2.1.m1.1c">\times</annotation></semantics></math> motion fields with up to 46<math id="S7.p2.2.m2.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\times" display="inline"><semantics id="S7.p2.2.m2.1a"><mo id="S7.p2.2.m2.1.1" xref="S7.p2.2.m2.1.1.cmml">×</mo><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S7.p2.2.m2.1b"><times id="S7.p2.2.m2.1.1.cmml" xref="S7.p2.2.m2.1.1"></times></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S7.p2.2.m2.1c">\times</annotation></semantics></math> smaller model size.
