<p id="id20.id1" class="ltx_p">Robotic crop phenotyping has emerged as a key technology to assess crops’ morphological and physiological traits at scale. These phenotypical measurements are essential for developing new crop varieties with the aim of increasing productivity and dealing with environmental challenges such as climate change. However, developing and deploying crop phenotyping robots face many challenges such as complex and variable crop shapes that complicate robotic object detection, dynamic and unstructured environments that baffle robotic control, and real-time computing and managing big data that challenge robotic hardware/software. This work specifically tackles the first challenge by proposing a novel Digital-Twin(DT)MARS-CycleGAN model for image augmentation to improve our Modular Agricultural Robotic System (MARS)’s crop object detection from complex and variable backgrounds. Our core idea is that in addition to the cycle consistency losses in the CycleGAN model, we designed and enforced a new DT-MARS loss in the deep learning model to penalize the inconsistency between real crop images captured by MARS and synthesized images sensed by DT MARS. Therefore, the generated synthesized crop images closely mimic real images in terms of realism, and they are employed to fine-tune object detectors such as YOLOv8. Extensive experiments demonstrated that our new DT/MARS-CycleGAN framework significantly boosts our MARS’ crop object/row detector’s performance, contributing to the field of robotic crop phenotyping.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">To sustain the growing world population, crop breeders strive to develop high-yielding and stress-tolerant cultivars that are more resilient to the changing climate, pests, and diseases <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>. Although advances in plant biotechnology, such as genome sequencing and genotyping technologies, have significantly accelerated the pace of crop breeding process <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>, phenotyping has been a bottleneck for crop improvement <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>. To address this challenge, automated robotic crop phenotyping technologies have been developed to assess and quantify phenotypic traits that are related to crop growth, yield, and adaption to environmental stresses <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>. Important crop phenotypic traits include morphological, structural, physiological, and biochemical properties at multiple organizational scales. It is crucial to phenotype a diverse range of crop genotypes across multiple environments to enable crop breeders to identify and select genotypes with desirable phenotypes best suited for specific environments. As a result, in-field high-throughput robotic phenotyping is indispensable for the effective selection of high-yielding and stress-tolerant varieties <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">However, developing field crop phenotyping robots faces multiple challenges. First, to address specific phenotyping needs, in-field crop phenotyping robots need highly specific platforms such as tower-based, gantry-based, ground mobile, low- and high-altitude aerial, and satellite-based systems. These crop phenotyping platforms also need highly specific computing devices and sensors such as edge devices, RGB color cameras, depth cameras, thermal imaging, and spectral imaging, and specific software tools such as ROS (robotic operating system) and deep learning acceleration packages <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>, to reduce the costs and allow for nondestructive characterization of the traits of interest. Second, field-based crop phenotyping robots typically need to build maps of the surrounding environment, plan their optimal paths, follow correct trajectories, navigate between crop rows, avoid obstacles, and collect phenotypical data in a breeding field. Although GPS is commonly used for robot navigation, the real-time-kinematic GPS is costly and high-quality signal reception is not always guaranteed. Therefore, the information provided by cameras along with GPS is typically necessary to precisely guide the phenotyping robot and avoid damage to crops and potential humans. Third, once large amounts of crop trait sensing datasets are acquired, data science and AI models are then needed to make necessary phenotypic inference and prediction <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>. Specific image-based phenotyping may include plant stress, plant development such as plant shoot morphology and growth, plant and plant organ counting, root system architecture, and crop postharvest quality assessment, among others.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">To deal with the above-mentioned challenges, a variety of field-based high-throughput crop phenotyping robots have been reported in the literature <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite> to handle various types of crops, including fruits such as grapes, apples, citrus, and tomatoes, and vegetables such as sugarcane, corn, soybean, cucumber, maize, and wheat. Robotic crop phenotyping has been particularly enhanced by deep learning models and vision sensor technologies, as recently reviewed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>. However, developing and deploying robotic crop phenotyping systems using computer vision and deep learning still face a few key challenges, particularly in dynamic, complex, and unstructured field environments <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. One extensively studied while still challenging problem in the field of robotic phenotyping domain is accurate crop detection. Accurately identifying the crop target is a prerequisite for the robot to perform multiple key downstream tasks such as crop row detection, path planning, navigation, and extraction of phenotypic traits <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Many deep learning based crop object detection methods have been proposed in the literature for various purposes such as crop seeding, yield estimation, phenotyping, and robotic harvesting, as surveyed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>. In terms of deep learning models, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are the most widely employed methods in crop object detection, as extensively reviewed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>. Briefly, object detection CNN models were specifically designed to identify interested targets from images, such as the RCNN <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite> and its variants based on two stages of region proposals and classifications, and the YOLO series models based on regressions of bounding boxes <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>. Further, these generic RCNN/YOLO models were fine-tuned on crop images with object annotations to be transferred to the agriculture domain. For instance, the RCNN model was transferred for fruit detection by fine-turning a Faster RCNN model with 100 annotated images <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>, and a comprehensive survey of this category of approaches is available in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>. Similarly, the YOLO model has been adopted and customized for crop detection, such as apple and pear detection in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>. With the popularity of few-shot learning, many studies have explored the fine-tuning of CNN models by using several examples for crop object detection, as surveyed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>. However, a generic concern in few-shot object detection is that the fine-tuned model might be subject to overfitting and its generalization capability could be a challenge, as pointed out in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">In parallel, image data augmentation strategy has been extensively explored to boost the training of deep learning models in agriculture <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>. The generative adversarial network (GAN) model <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite> has been particularly popular in generating synthesized image data for model training, e.g., those studies in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>, <a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite>. The GAN model has also been widely used in the general robotics field, e.g., for synthesizing large-scale realistic images for modeling training to deal with the reality gap problem in sim-to-real transfer <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>, <a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>, <a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>, <a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite>. For instances, the authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite> developed a novel GAN model to effectively adapt synthesized images to realistic ones by enforcing an object-detection consistency for visual grasping, and the authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite> developed a RL-CycleGAN model by applying the similarity of total expected future reward (Q-value) of Q-learning as an additional reinforcement learning (RL)-scene consistency loss, thus enabling effective sim-to-real transfer for reinforcement learning.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">Along this promising research direction, and inspired by the recent research in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite>, this paper specifically proposes a novel Digital-Twin(DT)/MARS-CycleGAN model for image augmentation to improve crop object detection from complex and variable farm background in the context of our MARS robotic phenotyping <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite>. Our methodological innovation is that real and virtual DT MARS robots are forced to mimic each other such that the gaps between simulated and realistic robotic crop phenotyping, e.g., crop/row detection, are minimized, thus the reality gap during zero-shot sim-to-real transfer of trained crop detection models is minimized at a fundamental level. Our novel algorithmic contribution here is that in addition to the classic cycle consistency losses in the CycleGAN model <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>]</cite>, we designed and integrated a novel digital-twin (DT)-MARS loss in the deep learning network to penalize the inconsistency between synthesized images generated by DT MARS and real crop images sensed by MARS. As a result, the generated synthetic crop images are significantly more realistic to real images, and thus they can be used to significantly better fine-tune the object detectors such as YOLOv8 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>]</cite>. The improved crop object detector was then employed for crop row detection in MARS’ real-world robotic phenotyping environment, which is a key step for robotic path planning and navigation. Extensive experimental results have demonstrated that our DT/MARS-CycleGAN framework significantly enhanced our MARS’ crop object/row detector’s performance, thus contributing to the fields of crop phenotyping robotics and precision agriculture.</p>

<p id="S2.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">There have been many innovative crop phenotyping robots reported in the literature, as surveyed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>. As discussed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>, these phenotyping robots can be categorized in different ways, e.g., autonomous vs non-autonomous systems such as tractors, manually pushed or motorized carts, gantries, and cable-driven systems, and wheeled vs tracked vs wheel-legged systems. Here, we briefly introduce a few crop phenotyping robot examples that are most relevant to our work in this paper. The Thorvald II system <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>]</cite> was developed based on the modular hardware and software concept, that is, the robot can be easily reconfigured to obtain the necessary physical properties to operate in multiple production contexts (e.g., tunnels, greenhouses, and open fields) and the mechanical properties can be adjusted for different track widths, power requirements, and load capacities. The modular agricultural robotic system (MARS) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite> is an autonomous and multi-purpose phenotyping robot with five essential hardware modules (wheel module, connection module, robot controller, robot frame, and power module) and three optional hardware modules (actuation module, sensing module, and smart attachment). An important feature of MARS <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite> is that different combinations of the hardware modules can make the needed configurations for specific agricultural tasks, such as crop phenotyping. The Field Scanalyzer <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>]</cite> robot platform, developed by LemnaTec, is a high-throughput phenotyping system that includes a sensor box for phenotyping sensors and environmental sensors such as cameras and LiDAR, to capture detailed phenotypic data on crops in large field plots. The Field Scanalyzer has environmental sensors on board and thus it can record climatic data during all phenotypic measurements to enable the meaningful link between phenotype and environment data. A comprehensive review of crop phenotyping robots is referred to <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>.</p>

The idea of real-time virtual representation via DT technologies significantly enable and facilitate the digitization of agriculture, in which data, modeling, and what-if simulations are integrated to provide a promising framework to address constraints in decision-making support and automation for various agricultural applications, including crop phenotyping, as reviewed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">39</a>]</cite>. In parallel, DT technologies have been recently explored in robotics <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">38</a>, <a href="#bib.bib40" title="" class="ltx_ref">40</a>]</cite>.

In this paper, our DT/MARS-CycleGAN model takes the advantages of using DT technologies in both agriculture and robotics by maximizing the similarity between the physical and virtual DT MARS robots so that their behaviors tend to be identical, and thus the reality gap in zero-shot sim-to-real transfer is minimized.</p>

For instance, in early studies, the scheme of splitting a high-resolution agriculture image into multiple small patches was proposed to deal with the CNN’s small input size issue <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>, and features from shallow layers of RCNN model were used for regional proposals to deal with the small fruit object detection problem <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib41" title="" class="ltx_ref">41</a>]</cite>.

The authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib44" title="" class="ltx_ref">44</a>]</cite> proposed a mask-guided ViT model for fruit object detection based on few-shot learning and reported promising results for apple detection. The interesting idea in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib44" title="" class="ltx_ref">44</a>]</cite> is that a mask is applied on image patches to screen out the task-irrelevant ones and to guide the ViT to focus on task-relevant and discriminative patches (e.g., apples) during few-shot learning. Particularly, the mask-guided ViT only introduces an additional mask operation and a residual connection, which enables the inheritance of parameters from pre-trained ViT without any additional cost. The authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib44" title="" class="ltx_ref">44</a>]</cite> also optimally selected representative few-shot samples (e.g., apples), and included an active learning based sample selection method to further improve the generalizability of the mask-guided ViT based few-shot learning. In terms of crop varieties, there are many types of deep learning models that have been developed for detecting grapes <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib45" title="" class="ltx_ref">45</a>]</cite>, apples <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib46" title="" class="ltx_ref">46</a>]</cite>, and citrus <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib47" title="" class="ltx_ref">47</a>]</cite>, among many others, as systematically surveyed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>.</p>

<p id="S2.SS3.p2.1" class="ltx_p">However, applying deep learning techniques to agriculture applications poses unique challenges too, particularly when it comes to data collection and variability. Agricultural settings are complex and unpredictable, with factors like plant development, weather fluctuations, and variable lighting conditions, making it difficult to amass the large, diverse datasets that deep learning models require. These uncontrollable elements complicate the task of capturing a comprehensive range of data variations, limiting the deep learning technology’s applicability in variable agricultural contexts. While there has been an increase in agricultural datasets recently <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib48" title="" class="ltx_ref">48</a>]</cite><cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib49" title="" class="ltx_ref">49</a>]</cite>, there is still a pressing need for specialized, publicly available datasets tailored specifically for agricultural applications.</p>

<div id="S2.SS4.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Image data augmentation has been a mainstream approach for improving the generalization capability of deep learning models, and this effective strategy has been extensively explored to boost the training of deep learning models in agriculture <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>, <a href="#bib.bib50" title="" class="ltx_ref">50</a>, <a href="#bib.bib51" title="" class="ltx_ref">51</a>]</cite>. Two general approaches have been proposed for image data augmentation, that is, generative deep learning models and computational simulations. The generative adversarial network (GAN) model <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite> and its many variants <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>]</cite> have been particularly widely used in generating synthesized image data for model training, e.g., those studies in precision agriculture <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>, <a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>, <a href="#bib.bib52" title="" class="ltx_ref">52</a>, <a href="#bib.bib53" title="" class="ltx_ref">53</a>]</cite>. Early work by Giuffrida et al <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib54" title="" class="ltx_ref">54</a>]</cite> utilized DCGAN for plant image synthesis, while Zhu et al <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib55" title="" class="ltx_ref">55</a>]</cite> leveraged Pix2Pix for improved leaf counting. Madsen et al’s models <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib56" title="" class="ltx_ref">56</a>, <a href="#bib.bib57" title="" class="ltx_ref">57</a>]</cite> catered to multiple species, thus achieving a notable 64.3% classification accuracy. Zhu et al <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib58" title="" class="ltx_ref">58</a>]</cite> implemented cDCGAN for plant vigor rating, achieving a 23% increase in testing accuracy, and Drees et al <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib59" title="" class="ltx_ref">59</a>]</cite> used CGAN for Brassica growth predictions, revealing challenges in field applications. To address dataset scarcity, Shete et al <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib60" title="" class="ltx_ref">60</a>]</cite> introduced TasselGAN for maize images, though its realism needs enhancement. The Global Wheat-Head Dataset (GWHD) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib61" title="" class="ltx_ref">61</a>]</cite> marked an advancement for wheat phenotyping. However, domain shift challenges persisted, prompting solutions like CycleGAN by Hartley and French <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib62" title="" class="ltx_ref">62</a>]</cite> which, when combined with real data, improved detection accuracy, underscoring the importance of real labeled images in agriculture.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS4.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS4.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Computational simulations have also been widely employed in agriculture robotics to generate training data. In an early study, Rahnemoonfar and Sheppard <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib63" title="" class="ltx_ref">63</a>]</cite> utilized a simplistic approach for tomato counting, that is, overlaying red dots on a background. A more intricate method involves the ”Cut, Paste, and Learn” strategy <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib64" title="" class="ltx_ref">64</a>]</cite>, by merging portions of distinct RGB images <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib65" title="" class="ltx_ref">65</a>, <a href="#bib.bib66" title="" class="ltx_ref">66</a>]</cite>. However, this approach is limited in representing different 3D orientations and lighting nuances. For enhanced realism, 3D plant models in virtual environments <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib67" title="" class="ltx_ref">67</a>]</cite> and techniques like photogrammetry <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib68" title="" class="ltx_ref">68</a>, <a href="#bib.bib69" title="" class="ltx_ref">69</a>]</cite> and L-systems<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib70" title="" class="ltx_ref">70</a>]</cite> have been employed. Alternatively, the authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib71" title="" class="ltx_ref">71</a>]</cite> introduced a robotic crop phenotyping simulation system that simultaneously navigates through occluded crop rows and performs phenotyping tasks, including measuring plant volume and canopy height using a 2D LiDAR in a nodding configuration.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS4.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS4.p3.1" class="ltx_p">However, neither GAN-based generation of synthesized images or simulation-generated images are realistic enough, which is typically called reality gap, for practical precision agriculture applications. Therefore, GAN model has been adopted for synthesizing realistic images to deal with the reality gap problem in sim-to-real transfer in the general robotics domain <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>, <a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>, <a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>, <a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite>. For instances, a novel RetinaGAN model <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite> was developed to effectively adapt synthesized images to realistic ones by adding an object-detection consistency for visual grasping, and a RL-CycleGAN model <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite> was developed by enforcing the similarity of total expected future reward (Q-value) of Q-learning as an additional reinforcement learning (RL)-scene consistency loss for visual grasping. Recently, a novel DT-CycleGAN <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite> was proposed to further bridge the reality gap in zero-shot sim-to-real transfer of visual grasping models. In DT-CycleGAN, in addition to the traditional cycle consistency losses, a grasping agent’s action consistency loss was defined and penalized to minimize the inconsistency of the grasping agent’s actions between the virtual states generated by the DT-CycleGAN generator and the real visual states. A key innovation of DT-CycleGAN is that it effectively integrates two mainstream image data augmentation methods of generative CycleGAN model and simulations in the digital twin space. This DT-CycleGAN model inspired us to perform simulations to generate synthesized crop images in the virtual space and employ a novel DT-MARS consistency loss to make the synthesized crop images more similar to real-world ones sensed by our MARS phenotyping robot.</p>

The MARS PhenoBot is a solar-powered modular platform with a four-wheel steering and four-wheel driving configuration. Each wheel module of MARS PhenoBot is equipped with an independent suspension mechanism, which makes it adaptable to uneven field terrain. The MARS PhenoBot robot is designed for streamlined modular phenotyping and specifically tailored for crop phenotyping <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite>. The robot is outfitted with three cameras, capturing views from the front, rear, and bottom, respectively. This setup allows for effective monitoring of crop growth and offers crucial row-specific data to enhance farm field navigation and to prevent crop damage. The bottom camera is specifically pointed at the ground to observe more details of the farm field and to detect crops and rows. More details of the MARS PhenoBot are referred to <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite>. The virtual DT robot of MARS PhenoBot was developed using the Solidworks tool. Special attention was given to simulating the camera perspectives (e.g., bottom camera for crop/row detection) to reduce discrepancies in visual sensing between the real robot and the DT version, thereby narrowing the reality gap during zero-shot sim-to-real transfer of crop object detection models.</p>

<p id="S3.SS2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">With the crop bounding boxes predicted by YOLOv8, the centers of all bounding boxes are extracted together to form the points data essential for crop row detection. Subsequently, the RANSAC algorithm is employed to discern a line representing the crop row that best fits the center points of the bounding boxes of crop objects. Then the detected crop row will be used as the input for visual serving control of the MARS PhenoBot. That is, the error offset of the detected crop row from the robot’s reference is used as the signal input to a PID (proportion, integration, and differentiation) controller to control the robot’s velocity and movement <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite>. It is apparent that accurate detection of crops and crop rows is a fundamentally important task for crop phenotyping robot’s path planning and navigation.</p>

The simulated images are acquired from the simulation environment, created by utilizing farm field images collected from the Internet as background and rendering 3D models of the crops as target objects at random positions. A virtual camera mounted on the DT robot captures these images within the simulated environment, and an analytical virtual model extracts the ground truth bounding boxes for each crop in the image based on predefined position information. Meanwhile, real images were obtained from actual farm environments by capturing video streams as the real robot traversed along the crop rows in the farm field.</p>

<p id="S3.SS4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Inspired by the DT-CycleGAN model <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite> that was originally designed for visual grasping, a novel DT-MARS consistency loss is introduced here to facilitate and enforce more coherent sim-to-real transfer of crop images. This additional loss aims to penalize any disparities in the positions and sizes of the DT crops represented by the bounding boxes on the image between the original and the style-transformed image, which is the output of the generator.</p>

Initially, we constructed the simulation environment by utilizing the Pybullet package, employing real farm field images as the background for the simulation environment, and arbitrarily placing 3D models of crops as target objects at random positions. To enrich the diversity of the generated simulation images, we collected 500 distinct publicly available images of farm fields and created 3D models of three different crop species: sweet beet, polygonum and cirsium at varying growth stages. Subsequently, images are captured by utilizing a virtual camera positioned on the DT robot (bottom view for crop/row sensing) within the simulation environment, and an analytical virtual model extracts the ground truth bounding boxes for each crop in the image based on the predefined position information.</p>

Given the hardware constraints of real crop robot and the necessity for real-time processing in robotic phenotyping tasks, we employ the YOLOv8n detection model for lightweight deployment and swift inference. Specifically, the YOLOv8n weights pre-trained on the COCO dataset serve as the initialization, followed by a fine-tuning step on our generated simulation crop detection dataset for domain adaptation.</p>

By incorporating unlabeled real image frames extracted from video streams captured by the real robot that navigated along crop rows in actual farm environments,
the reality gap in zero-shot sim-to-real transfer is notably reduced during the training of DT/MARS-CycleGAN within the simulation environment. Specifically, 2,400 simulation images with automatically annotated bounding boxes, and 2,400 real frames extracted from the video stream are employed. The training configurations align with those described in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>]</cite>. In contrast to RetinaGAN <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite>, where the sim-to-real transfer process solely functions as a method to augment data for training the detection model, our framework facilitates the simultaneous training of the crop detection model and the DT/MARS-CycleGAN.

Conversely, with the additional consistency loss of target detection, RetinaGAN can somewhat adequately preserve target information; however, the background transformed by this model appears uniform and repetitive, lacking in variety. This could be due to the fixed detection model parameters in RetinaGAN, which constrain the model within the simulation domain and hamper its adaptability in the real domain, leading to an incomplete transfer of background style.

The main reason is that the crop detector trained with DT/MARS-CycleGAN generated images possesses better zero-shot transfer ability in real-world farm field situations. In addition, the overall performances of the basic line fitting algorithm with the least squares method are better than RANSAC, and the main reason is that the number of crops in testing images are mainly in the range of 3 to 6 and the RANSAC-based algorithm sometimes could filter abnormal values that actually belong to the real crops. The improved crop row detection method will be deployed for automated navigation of the MARS PhenoBot in real-world crop farm field in the future.</p>

Our proposed DT/MARS-CycleGAN model significantly diminishes the human effort required to accumulate labeled real-world training data of annotated crop object bounding boxes. By eliminating this laborious endeavor, we can harness substantial amounts of simulation data to enhance zero-shot sim-to-real transfer further. To quantify the influence of the size of simulation data, we trained the crop detection model with varying sample sizes in the simulation environment. As depicted in Table <a href="#S4.T3" title="TABLE III ‣ IV-C Crop Row Detection ‣ IV Evaluation ‣ DT/MARS-CycleGAN: Improved Object Detection for MARS Phenotyping Robot" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">III</span></a>, the mAP50 elevates from 0.903 to 0.917 by merely augmenting simulation data from 100 to 2,400, and the mAP50-90 ascends from 0.607 to 0.656. These findings underscore that ample simulation data can notably boost detection performance and consequently aid in achieving high-quality sim-to-real transfer by contributing to the DT-MARS consistency loss in the proposed DT/MARS-CycleGAN.</p>

<p id="S4.SS4.p2.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S4.SS4.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Evaluation on Different Crop Species and Growth Stages:</span>
Crop species and growth stages can significantly influence a model’s generalizability, as appearances across different species and growth stages can be either highly similar or distinctly different. Selecting an optimal set of crop species and growth stages for generating simulation images can improve the performance of crop detection models pre-trained on such simulation data. In Table <a href="#S4.T4" title="TABLE IV ‣ IV-C Crop Row Detection ‣ IV Evaluation ‣ DT/MARS-CycleGAN: Improved Object Detection for MARS Phenotyping Robot" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">IV</span></a>, we trained the detection model on simulation images with various species. Results indicate that sugar beet achieves better detection performance compared to other species. This is likely because its appearance closely resembles that of collard and kale in the test images. Additionally, training data that combines various species outperforms data from any single species, suggesting that diverse species combinations can enrich training data and thus enhance model generalizability. Table <a href="#S4.T5" title="TABLE V ‣ IV-C Crop Row Detection ‣ IV Evaluation ‣ DT/MARS-CycleGAN: Improved Object Detection for MARS Phenotyping Robot" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">V</span></a> presents the detection performance based on training with different growth stages. Similarly, mixed data covering all growth stages surpasses training that focuses solely on one stage.</p>

The images generated in the simulation environment are pivotal to the proposed framework as they compose the annotated crop images for both stages of the training. To evaluate the effectiveness of varying generation settings in the simulation environment, we conducted object detection model training using different combinations presented in Table <a href="#S4.T6" title="TABLE VI ‣ IV-C Crop Row Detection ‣ IV Evaluation ‣ DT/MARS-CycleGAN: Improved Object Detection for MARS Phenotyping Robot" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">VI</span></a>.

<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">This paper introduces a novel DT/MARS-CycleGAN framework, effectively bridging the reality gap between simulated and real-world environments and facilitating effective zero-shot sim-to-real transfer in robotic crop detection. By imposing both cycle and DT-MARS consistency losses, which penalizes discrepancies in visual appearance and crop target between synthesized and real-world crop images, the proposed method achieves highly effective sim-to-real transfer. The fine-tuned object detectors on this diverse and high-quality synthetic data substantially elevates detection performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed DT/MARS-CycleGAN framework enables more robust crop perception from complex backgrounds, advancing the field of robotic crop phenotyping. This work provides an effective solution to a critical robotic vision challenge in unstructured and complex agricultural environments, moving towards more productive and resilient crop phenotyping and crop breeding process in the future.</p>

<div id="S5.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p2.1" class="ltx_p">This work can be further extended along the general direction of foundation models and large vision models <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib73" title="" class="ltx_ref">73</a>, <a href="#bib.bib74" title="" class="ltx_ref">74</a>]</cite> in the future. Though our DT/MARS-CycleGAN framework demonstrated a reasonably good zero-shot transfer capability, its performance in dealing with the variation of real-world crop images can be further improved using the new methodology of foundation model <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib73" title="" class="ltx_ref">73</a>]</cite>. To realize such a goal, the backbones of our DT/MARS-CycleGAN and object detection networks would be upgraded by the more powerful ViT model and its variants <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib42" title="" class="ltx_ref">42</a>, <a href="#bib.bib44" title="" class="ltx_ref">44</a>, <a href="#bib.bib75" title="" class="ltx_ref">75</a>]</cite>, and should be trained and fine-tuned on much larger scale of datasets, towards a foundation model of crop image understanding and other tasks in the future.</p>
