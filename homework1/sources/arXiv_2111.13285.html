<h6 class="ltx_title ltx_title_abstract">Abstract</h6>
<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">This paper considers to jointly tackle the highly correlated tasks of estimating 3D human body poses and predicting future 3D motions from RGB image sequences.
Based on Lie algebra pose representation, a novel self-projection mechanism is proposed that naturally preserves human motion kinematics.
This is further facilitated by a sequence-to-sequence multi-task architecture based on an encoder-decoder topology,
which enables us to tap into the common ground shared by both tasks.
Finally, a global refinement module is proposed to boost the performance of our framework.
The effectiveness of our approach, called PoseMoNet, is demonstrated by ablation tests and empirical evaluations on Human3.6M and HumanEva-I benchmark, where competitive performance is obtained comparing to the state-of-the-arts.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Obtaining three-dimensional human poses from monocular image data is a fundamental yet challenging problem in computer vision. In many recent efforts <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>, 3D human pose estimation has been decomposed into a two-stage process: first, the 2D keypoints that correspond to the body joints are detected from the 2D image, after which the detected joints are lifted to obtain 3D pose.
This type of solution is elegant in terms of the simplicity of problem formulation, unfortunately it suffers from inherent ambiguities caused by projection:
different 3D poses can share the same 2D pose projection given a specific viewpoint; that is, the mapping between the 2D joints detection and 3D pose is not bijective.
To resolve this ambiguity of 3D pose estimation from a monocular image, video-based pose estimation is also investigated in the literature <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>.
Existing video-based pose estimation methods, however, either need to observe a relatively long history (243 frames <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite> or can only handle a short video sequence (4-6 frames <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>) to achieve their best results.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In the meantime, there has been a growing stream of research endeavours on the closely related problem of future motion prediction:
by observing a past sequence of 3D poses, the future 3D motion could be generated <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>.
However, the requirement of past 3D pose sequence could be problematic: the MoCap data can be obtained relatively easily in a controlled lab environment but it is nearly infeasible to be captured in the wild at a reasonable cost.
Besides, in predicting the future motion, motion prediction takes as input a short history of 3D pose sequence, which, in a sense, could be considered as a generalization of video-based pose estimation, where instead of current poses, the output here is future poses.</p>

The input to the pipeline is a sequence of observed video frames. A 2D keypoint detector is used to generate the corresponding 2D pose sequence. The predicted 2D pose sequence is then lifted to its 3D pose representation by the Pose Lifting Network (PLN). The Motion Generation Network uses the latent hidden state (from PLN) and the last estimated 3D pose as the seed pose to generate future motion. Finally, the entire predicted past pose and future motion sequence is refined together by the global refinement module.</span></figcaption>
</figure>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Motivated by these observations, in this paper, we propose an approach to jointly address the closely related problems of inferring 3D human poses and predicting future motions from an RGB video.
It not only allows us to tap into the common ground of the human motion dynamics shared by both problems but also facilitates the removal of the unnecessary MoCap constraints from the problem of future 3D motion prediction.
A sequence-to-sequence multi-task approach is proposed to exploit the benefits of pose estimation from RGB video and future motion prediction from a partial RGB image sequence.
A simple yet effective encoder-decoder framework back-boned by Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) called PoseMoNet is thus proposed to tackle both problems. As depicted in Fig. <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ 3D Pose Estimation and Future Motion Prediction from 2D Images" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>, it contains four major components:
(1) a pre-trained 2D keypoint detector is used to detect the 2D pose of a human for each of the input video frame;
(2) a Pose Lifting Network (PLN) maps a 2D pose sequence to 3D pose sequence and encodes the motion dynamics in a latent representation;
(3) the latent representation and a predicted seed pose from the last observed time step are passed to the Motion Generation Network (MGN) to predict future motions;
and (4) a global trajectory refinement module will further polish the entire trajectory estimated by both the PLN and the MGN.
While in existing encoder-decoder architectures for motion prediction <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>, the role of the encoder is to extract temporal motion dynamic from past 3D pose sequence to a latent representation and the decoder will then derive the future motion from it, our PLN encoder only requires 2D pose sequence as input.
In short, our PLN tries to estimate the corresponding 3D pose sequence from the given 2D pose sequence as well as extract and compress the motion dynamics.
It is worth mentioning that although the deep learning methods can generate future dynamics and achieve decent results on quantitative metrics, studies <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite> have shown the generated future motion tends to converge to a mean pose.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">A stronger evidence<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite> reveals that, quantitatively, predicting future motion as with a zero-velocity baseline can beat many well-trained deep learning methods.
In other words, the trained model, instead of being trained to really understand human dynamics and predict the future motion, is actually overfitted to the quantitative metric.
We address this issue by adopting a Lie algebra-based pose representation and propose a self-projection mechanism that encourages the generated future motion to be more realistic and dynamic.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Our work is motivated and inspired by existing literature <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite> but different from them.
First, none of the current literature attempts to handle 3D pose sequence estimation and future motion prediction simultaneously.
We utilize this multitask setting and shows that by pairing future motion prediction with 3D pose sequence estimation, the learning system gains robustness and achieves better performance with smaller joints error on both tasks.
For the future motion prediction task, our proposed framework eliminates the requirement of the ground truth past 3D pose sequence and the input of a ground truth seed pose, where only the 2D video sequence is leveraged instead.
Furthermore, our framework shows that it is unnecessary to involve past 3D pose sequences to generate the future as it can be achieved from 2D pose sequence input by our pose estimation task.</p>

<div id="S2.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">3D human pose estimation research is affected by deep learning significantly in recent years where conventional methods <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite> are overtaken by deep learning methods.
As the 2D human pose estimation results are progressively improved, researchers have also started to use detected 2D keypoints as an intermediate for 3D human pose estimation.
Many works try to build algorithms that map the 2D keypoints to a 3D pose, such as using the nearest neighbor search <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>, or building a parametrized method with neural networks to approximate it <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>. However, body parts occlusion is a critical issue for these types of 2D-to-3D methods, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite> proposed to use multi-scale heatmaps together with an occlusion augmentation module to further resolve the occlusion problem.
The graphical structure of human pose is also leveraged by novel graph convolutional network methods.
In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>, the authors further inject the graph structure into a GAN-based human pose estimation model to capture the relationship of body joints. Pose Graph
Convolutional Network (PGCN) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite> is introduced to exploit structural relationships between body key points to further improve the localization performance for pose estimation.
A similar idea is examined from a different perspective in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>, joint interdependency is leveraged to estimate 3D joint position from RGB images by incorporating structural relationships of the human body, and a progressively designed propagating LSTM framework is used to tackle the pose estimation stage by stage.
In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>, weakly-supervised methods are proposed to leverage both synthetic data and weakly-labeled real-world data, where the depth-aid regularizer provides weak supervision for 3D pose estimation without any costly 3D annotation required.
Further improvements are investigated by introducing the temporal dimension at the input.
A sequence of 2D keypoints are used to provide smoother spatial constraints where <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite> leverages recurrent models and <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite> built a 1D convolution model with optional temporal dilation.
A grounded spatial-temporal learning framework was proposed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite> to leverage both the temporal context in the video sequence and the spatial information in the graph-based skeleton. In the light of exploring spatial-temporal learning, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite> use the entire video as the context for predicting the bone direction along with a consistent bone length across the entire video. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite> proposed a multi-step refinement and estimation framework that refines the 2D input keypoint sequence and then concurrently considering the structure of 2D inputs and 3D outputs.
Interestingly, another family of methods <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>, <a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>, <a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite> train deep models to directly model the human shape represented by SMPL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite> and perform reverse inference from the shape to the corresponding pose.</p>

<p id="S2.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The essence of motion prediction or generation can be thought of as a sequence generation task.
Conventional approaches leveraged Gaussian processes <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite> and hidden Markov models <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite> to learn the representation of human motion.
With the recent release of several large-scale motion capture (MoCap) datasets <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>, <a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite>, most of the recent research efforts involved deep models, more specifically, recurrent neural networks.
Encoder-Recurrent-Decoder (ERD) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite> can be considered as one of the earliest attempts to leverage the superior learning power with deep models for human motion prediction.
A residual Gated Rectified Unit network for generating future human dynamics is proposed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>, as well as a zero-velocity baseline that outperforms previous works. Interestingly, the zero-velocity baseline outperforms <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite> by simply predicting the last observed pose as the result.
Structural-RNN <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite> considers the body parts of humans and the object in the scene from a graph structure perspective though it requires human intervention to design such graph structures.
Generative adversarial networks are employed and both the geometric property of articulated objects and adversarial learning concept are utilized to further push the quantitative results for predicting long-term human motion <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>. The only drawback is the involvement of the classifier (discriminator) make the training process more sensitive and complicated.
Instead of using a recurrent architecture to model the motion context, a modified highway unit is utilized in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite>.
And a hierarchical motion context network combined with a Lie algebra pose representation similar to <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite> is introduced in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>. Furthermore, human dynamics can be learned by working directly in the trajectory space, instead of the traditionally used pose space <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>]</cite>, by using discrete cosine transform.
With recent advances of the attention mechanism, in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>]</cite>, an attention-based feed-forward network is proposed to accommodate the observation that human motion tends to repeat itself. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>]</cite> applies a transformer-based architecture with the global attention mechanism as well as proposing a memory-based dictionary which help to preserve the global motion pattern.</p>

<div id="S2.SS3.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Popular deep learning methods are usually built for a single particular task. However, potential benefits may be obtained through a multitask learning (MTL) setting on related tasks. Early works have shown that MTL is intuitively plausible to obtain inductive bias by including implicit data augmentation, regularization, and representation bias <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>]</cite>. Common MTL methods with deep learning usually follow different patterns, such as joint learning (parameter sharing) and learning with auxiliary tasks. Parameter sharing usually has two forms: hard sharing and soft sharing. Hard sharing comes with the form of using task-specific output layers while sharing the layers before task-specific layers among all tasks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>]</cite>. Soft sharing usually means most of the layers in the neural networks are jointly trained together under the supervision from all tasks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">38</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS3.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS3.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In the field of computer vision, significant efforts are put into leveraging MTL or joint learning.
An Identity-Aware CycleGAN (IACycleGAN) model that applies a new perceptual loss to supervise the image generation network is introduced for both face photo-sketch synthesis and recognition <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">39</a>]</cite>.
It is reasonable to improve the super-resolution performance on both the color and the depth image by incorporate mutual information shared by them together with a GAN-based architectural design <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib40" title="" class="ltx_ref">40</a>]</cite>.
A 2D/3D multitask system is proposed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib41" title="" class="ltx_ref">41</a>]</cite> where uses the pose estimation part as the primary tasks and jointly leverage the learned features for fine-grained action recognition.
The idea of MTL seems to be effectively involved in existing works with an encoder-decoder pattern for different types of computer vision tasks.
Face alignment in the video is tackled with a recurrent encoder-decoder architecture in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib42" title="" class="ltx_ref">42</a>]</cite>, where the proposed framework predicts 2D facial keypoint maps and also a constrained shape response map. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib43" title="" class="ltx_ref">43</a>]</cite>, the authors proposed a multi-purpose framework for image-to-video translation, and a recurrent encoder-decoder architecture is used for face alignment as well as generating future motion masks. These works also motivate us to explore the possibility of applying this pattern for 3D human pose estimation though they are not performing the 3D human pose estimation task itself.</p>

These observed video frames are then fed to a 2D pose detector network to obtain a sequence of 2D keypoints in the form of normalized image coordinate.
In this work, we use a 16-joint human skeleton model.
The 2D pose sequence is then passed to the Pose Lifting Network (PLN) that lifts the 2D pose sequence to its predicted corresponding 3D representations.
A Motion Generation Network (MGN) that uses the last predicted 3D pose as the seed pose and the latent representation from the PLN to predict future poses.
Finally, a global refinement (GR) module is applied over the entire predicted sequence, including both the predicted 3D pose and the 3D future motion.
Furthermore, we consider the commonly used 3D coordinate representation as a good baseline though it suffers from the problem of lacking physical constraints. In addition, a Lie algebra representation is used as to provide more grounded physical constraints, especially the 3D ground truth past sequence is not used in our work as the common 3D future motion prediction. Therefore, at each time step, two 3D poses are estimated (applied for both PLN and MGN).

However, this type of representation contains no physical constraints and no other information such as rotation except for the spatial position of joints.
If this is unclear to you, imagine to rotate your wrist and you should be able to notice that although those are different poses, the relative position of your wrist to other joints remains the same as before.</p>

Right: the Lie algebra-based pose, while each bone itself maintains a local coordinate system, the position of each bone except for the one selected as root bone (joint 9-10) can be inferred by the nature of a kinematic chain by using ordinary matrix transformation. There are 5 kinematic chains used in the Lie-algebra-based pose, 3 of them are rooted from joint 10, namely the main back and two legs. The two chains represent two arms are originated from joint 2 and therefore can be also inferred from joint 10 with rotation angles.</span></figcaption>

<p id="S3.SS2.SSSx2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The Pose Lifting Network (PLN) is designed to handle the task of lifting a 2D pose sequence to its corresponding 3D pose trajectory on its own duty, as well as behave as the encoder network in the overall framework.</p>

<p id="S3.SS2.SSSx2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">As shown in Figure <a href="#S3.F4" title="Figure 4 ‣ Pose Lifting Network ‣ 3.2 PoseMoNet ‣ 3 Methodology ‣ 3D Pose Estimation and Future Motion Prediction from 2D Images" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a>, the architecture design of the PLN is summarized as the following:
it consists of a feed-forward neural network (FFNN), then a 2-layer bi-directional Gated Rectified Unit (GRU), and finally a Self-Projection (SP) layer for producing the 3D pose trajectory.
There are two linear layers in the FFNN and both are followed by a Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) as the non-linearity.
Dropout is added after all non-linearity layers except for the output layer from the SP layer, which does not have an activation function.</p>

First, with the incorporation of the Self-Projection layer, the outputs from recurrent cells are used to estimate two different types of pose representations where the soft parameter sharing mechanism contained in the SP layers can also introduce plausible regularization power and induction bias. It frames the multitask setting at a local level. Secondly, along with the MGN, the PLN is trained to not only lifting the 2D pose sequence to its corresponding 3D pose sequence but also try to estimate and encode 3D dynamics efficiently for generating reasonable future 3D motion, it concludes the multitask setup at the global level.</p>

Eleven subjects who are professional actors perform 15 different daily activities such as eating, walking, smoking, discussing, and greeting. All of the performances are captured by 4 cameras placed at the pre-defined positions in the room so the intrinsic and extrinsic camera parameters are known.
Only video frames from seven of the eleven subjects are annotated and publicly available, so we follow the previous work to split the training and testing set <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>. We downsample the video frame rate by a factor of 2 reducing the video from 50 MHz to 25 MHz.
To align with the literature, we modify the skeleton data in Human3.6M to a 16-joint version.

<div id="S4.SS3.SSSx1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS3.SSSx1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">It has been shown in previous works that directly regressing the future poses with the ordinary ”XYZ” pose representation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite> can easily produce unrealistic poses, we first validate this observation with our PoseMoNet by turning off the supervision at the Lie algebra pose representation outputted by the self-projection module.
It is worth to highlight that, although the ordinary ”XYZ” pose representation is most commonly used and there is no significant shortage of using it, we argue and empirically show that only the plain pose representation is insufficient in our work. We have 2 fundamental differences compared with existing works. First, to the best of our knowledge, a 3D MoCap pose sequence is required as the input for all the existing 3D future motion prediction method, where in our work, we only use 2D pose keypoint sequence as the only input to the task. Secondly, in our work, we are looking 1 more step further by considering a real world application scenario, we only leverage estimated 2D keypoint location without any human intervention, which make the problem more difficult and significantly different.
The result shows that both training and prediction are unstable and can easily lead to divergence. Therefore, we omit the quantitative comparison for this ablative experiment and show an expressive qualitative visualization.</p>

As mentioned, we first train our framework without supervision on the Lie algebra pose representation. The result is shown in the middle column, denote as ”XYZ”. We also replicated the model proposed as Res-GRU <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite> and show the result in the right column. We see that the previous competitive method may also suffer from the issue caused by no physical constraints. Finally, we add the results predicted by our framework trained completely with both pose representation and all loss terms. Not surprisingly, while other setups start to diverge on the predictions under a longer-than-usual context, the prediction from our framework, even after a 1600ms temporal context, is still natural and dynamic. This observation consolidates the effectiveness of including the Lie algebra pose representation in the training phase as well as using it to provide self-regularization with implicit physical constraints.</p>

<p id="S4.SS3.SSSx3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The proposed global refinement module consists of two baseline refinement networks mentioned previously. The effectiveness of the global refinement module is validated from two perspectives. To select the best architecture for pose trajectory refinement, we compared different settings for refining the entire pose trajectory under the following settings: using only the GRU-based model, using only the ConvED, and combining them to the proposed global refinement module. Quantitative results are obtained with different lengths of input video sequences and reported in Table <a href="#S4.T2" title="Table 2 ‣ With vs. Without the Global Refinement Module ‣ 4.3 Ablative Study ‣ 4 Empirical Evaluations ‣ 3D Pose Estimation and Future Motion Prediction from 2D Images" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>. We see that the GRU alone provides more improvement for pose estimation, which consolidated our observation that a significant amount of errors on pose sequence estimation is caused by the non-smooth prediction among consecutive frames. On the other hand, ConvED focuses more on the spatiotemporal context of the pose sequence, which not surprisingly enhanced the result of the motion generator more than the GRU. On combining results from both paths, the adaptive weighting mechanism has been shown to be helpful in terms of quantitative performance.</p>

It is important to note that a recently proposed work <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite> leverages extra data augmentation step to improve the 2D keypoint detection result, which further pushed the performance.

Unfortunately, as the source code is not publicly available at the time we conduct experiments, we are not able to reproduce the proposed data augmentation. For the sake of completeness, we report both results in Table <a href="#S4.T3" title="Table 3 ‣ 3D Pose Estimation in Video ‣ 4.4 Evaluation on Human3.6M Dataset ‣ 4 Empirical Evaluations ‣ 3D Pose Estimation and Future Motion Prediction from 2D Images" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a>.</p>

<p id="S4.SS4.SSSx1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">We can see that compared with the state-of-the-art methods, by exploiting the temporal information along the sequence as well as the motion dynamics from future motion prediction task, our approach achieves the decent performance with the smallest error averaging across all actions and holding the 1st place for most categories of actions, such as Eating, Greet, Purch, etc. Interestingly, two methods <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite> that use very large context information (<math id="S4.SS4.SSSx1.p2.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\geq" display="inline"><semantics id="S4.SS4.SSSx1.p2.1.m1.1a"><mo id="S4.SS4.SSSx1.p2.1.m1.1.1" xref="S4.SS4.SSSx1.p2.1.m1.1.1.cmml">≥</mo><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S4.SS4.SSSx1.p2.1.m1.1b"><geq id="S4.SS4.SSSx1.p2.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS4.SSSx1.p2.1.m1.1.1"></geq></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S4.SS4.SSSx1.p2.1.m1.1c">\geq</annotation></semantics></math> 243 frames) outperform our framework on action types ”Walking” and ”Walking Together”. These two types of actions are highly predictable if being estimated from a larger context due to its cyclic nature, where the pose estimation task can be benefited. On the other hand, our method performs particularly well on more random actions, such as ”Eating”, ”Photo”, ”Purch” and ”Smoke” compared with existing methods. This observation meets the fact that a human does not need to see a relatively long presence of other people to estimate and understand their pose from 2D inputs.</p>
</div>
<div id="S4.SS4.SSSx1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS4.SSSx1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Furthermore, our framework only needs to observe a relatively short sequence (54 frames) to produce sound predictions for both 3D pose estimation and motion prediction, which makes it comes with the potential to be deployed easier in a real-world real-time situation. We argue that the longer the context is, the more diminishing of returns, even potential negative effects, can be observed. This can be seen in the cases of estimating pose stochastic activities such as ”Sitting”, ”Purch”, ”Posing” and ”Discussing”. Our method has more stable and quantitatively better results compared to methods that leverage a larger context <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>.
We have also noticed that existing works can produce better quantitative results with even a single-frame input <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite> though longer contexts are used in our framework, we argue that the architecture in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite> at the single-frame setting requires significantly more computations as it is a 5-block residual architecture, also with more parameters, where our recurrent-based architecture can be more efficient. It is also worth to mention that the future motion predictions task suffer significantly from using an estimated 2D keypoint sequence as the original input, it also affects the performance of pose estimation, particularly when the sequence is short (i.e., 9-frame).</p>

<p id="S4.SS4.SSSx2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">It is worth highlighting that our proposed work has a fundamental difference with the existing motion prediction literature where makes it is infeasible to have a completely fair and controlled experiment: we do not use the historical 3D ground truth as the input of the motion prediction task.

Interestingly, the quantitative advantage of our method starts to deviate after 720ms. First, we believe this observation is acceptable, as there is, indeed, a potential drawback of using only the 2D pose sequence as the input. Besides, we argue that there are always trade-offs between the quantitative result and the quality of generated future motion as it has been pointed out that a very simple baseline, Zero-velocity <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>, which always produces the static mean pose outperforms many existing works quantitatively.</p>
</div>
<div id="S4.SS4.SSSx2.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS4.SSSx2.p4.1" class="ltx_p">We further validate the above observation by a qualitative visualization provided in <a href="#S4.F10" title="Figure 10 ‣ Future Motion Prediction ‣ 4.4 Evaluation on Human3.6M Dataset ‣ 4 Empirical Evaluations ‣ 3D Pose Estimation and Future Motion Prediction from 2D Images" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">10</span></a>. Surprisingly, we found that the relatively high error measured under the MAE metrics not necessarily translates to a ”bad” prediction of the future motion due to the fact that MAE is ambiguous which leads to the result of different sets of angles that may yield similar poses.
The visualization further consolidated that we are still able to generate sound poses for future motions. In particular, many previous methods have the problem that the predicted future motion starts to either drift or converge to a static pose <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite> but in our case, for example, the walking action can keep being dynamic after a relatively long period.</p>

Due to the fact that different skeletal structures are used (different number of joints) as well as the input is no longer historical 3D ground truth poses, the quantitative results shacked significantly and we reported them in Table <a href="#S4.T5" title="Table 5 ‣ Future Motion Prediction ‣ 4.4 Evaluation on Human3.6M Dataset ‣ 4 Empirical Evaluations ‣ 3D Pose Estimation and Future Motion Prediction from 2D Images" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5</span></a>.

<p id="S4.SS5.p1.2" class="ltx_p">A complete theoretical complexity analysis of our proposed framework is beyond the scope of this work. Therefore, we use a recently configured workstation to empirically evaluate the computational complexity. The workstation comes with an Intel i9-7900X CPU, RTX 2080 Ti GPU with 12 GB graphic memory, and 128 GB random access memory (RAM). We randomly select 1000 input 2D keypoint sequences of length 27, which is the same as our previous experiment, and use them to perform inference with different lengths of future motion conditions.

Real-time applications then become fully considerable.
The recurrent architecture can be a better fit when the input sequence is relatively short (i.e., with 9, 27, 54-frame setting), however, convolutional architectures <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite> can be more efficient when the longer input sequence is involved (i.e., over 100-frame input). From a potential application aspect, it should be decided on the application end which one is a better fit.</p>

<div id="S5.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The closely related, but often separately considered tasks of 3D human pose estimation and future motion prediction are jointly tackled in this paper. By doing so, a dedicated approach, PoseMoNet, is developed to exploit the innate connections of both tasks:
The proposed framework, to the best of our knowledge, is the first work to tackle the 3D pose sequence estimation and future motion prediction together.
A novel mixture-of-expert self-projection module is introduced to implicitly leverage the physical constraints provided by the Lie algebra pose representation;
Multiple granularities of multitask settings are investigated and leveraged in the proposed framework.
We demonstrated that 3D MoCap data is not a sole requirement for generating future 3D motion by combining it with the 3D pose sequence estimation task.
Empirical experiments on well-known Human3.6M and HumanEva-I benchmarks demonstrate the competitive performance in addressing the problems of 3D pose sequence estimation and future motion generation.
Future work may focus on multiple aspects. An interesting direction is that an investigation beyond the estimation of current and future single poses, including estimation of current and future 3D shapes, and further investigation into visual scenarios involving the interactions of multiple people. In addition, recurrent architectures are the major components in our proposed work, future works may pay attention to other advanced research efforts such as transformer architectures that can avoid step-by-step inference caused by the recurrent architecture as well as graph convolution networks that can leverage the skeletal property of articulated objects.</p>
