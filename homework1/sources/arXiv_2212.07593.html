<p id="id9.1" class="ltx_p">This paper investigates a phenomenon where query-based object detectors mispredict at the last decoding stage while predicting correctly at an intermediate stage. We review the training process and attribute the overlooked phenomenon to two limitations:
lack of training emphasis and cascading errors from decoding sequence.
We design and present Selective Query Recollection (SQR), a simple and effective training strategy for query-based object detectors.
It cumulatively collects intermediate queries as decoding stages go deeper and selectively forwards the queries to the downstream stages aside from the sequential structure.
Such-wise, SQR places training emphasis on later stages and allows later stages to work with intermediate queries from earlier stages directly. SQR can be easily plugged into various query-based object detectors and significantly enhances their performance while leaving the inference pipeline unchanged. As a result, we apply SQR on Adamixer, DAB-DETR, and Deformable-DETR across various settings (backbone, number of queries, schedule) and consistently brings <math id="id9.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="1.4\sim 2.8" display="inline"><semantics id="id9.1.m1.1a"><mrow id="id9.1.m1.1.1" xref="id9.1.m1.1.1.cmml"><mn id="id9.1.m1.1.1.2" xref="id9.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml">1.4</mn><mo id="id9.1.m1.1.1.1" xref="id9.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml">∼</mo><mn id="id9.1.m1.1.1.3" xref="id9.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml">2.8</mn></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="id9.1.m1.1b"><apply id="id9.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="id9.1.m1.1.1"><csymbol cd="latexml" id="id9.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="id9.1.m1.1.1.1">similar-to</csymbol><cn type="float" id="id9.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml" xref="id9.1.m1.1.1.2">1.4</cn><cn type="float" id="id9.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml" xref="id9.1.m1.1.1.3">2.8</cn></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="id9.1.m1.1c">1.4\sim 2.8</annotation></semantics></math> AP improvement.

<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Object detection is a long-established topic in computer vision aiming to localize and categorize objects of interest.

</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Recent research attention has been geared towards query-based object detection <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>, <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>, <a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>, <a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">38</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite> since the thriving of transformer <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite> and DETR <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>. By viewing detection as a direct set prediction problem, the new archetype represents the set of objects using a set of learnable embeddings, termed as queries, which are fed to a decoder consisting of a stack (typically six) of decoding stages. Each stage performs similar operations: (1) interacting queries with image features via an attention-like mechanism, so the queries are aggregated with valuable information that represents objects; (2) reasoning the relation among all queries so that global dependency on objects co-occurrence and duplicates could be captured; (3) interpreting bounding box and category from each query by a feed forward network. Queries are sequentially processed stage-by-stage, and each stage is formulated to learn a residual function with reference to the former stage’s output, aiming to refine queries in a cascaded style.</p>

<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">As such wise, the decoding procedure implies that detection should be stage-by-stage enhanced in terms of IoU and confidence score. Indeed, monotonically improved AP is empirically achieved by this procedure. However, when visualizing the stage-wise predictions, we surprisingly observe that decoder makes mistakes in a decent proportion of cases where the later stages degrade true-positives and upgrade false-positives from the former stages. As shown in Fig.<a href="#S1.F2" title="Figure 2 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ Enhanced Training of Query-Based Object Detection via Selective Query Recollection" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>, the traffic light at stage 1 gets categorical confidence of 0.41, while from stage 2 to 5 the confidence gradually decreases to 0.21; the remote at stage 3 was wrongly classified as a cell phone, while from stage 3 to 6 the error was exacerbated from 0.26 to 0.42.

</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">This phenomenon inspires us to review the current training strategy and bring two conjectures.
<span id="S1.p4.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Firstly</span>, the responsibility that each stage takes is unbalanced, while supervision applied to them is analogous. An early stage could make mistakes without causing too much impact because it gets chances to be corrected later, and the later stages are more responsible for the final prediction. But during training, all of these stages are supervised in an equivalent manner and there lacks such a mechanism that places particular training emphasis on later stages.
<span id="S1.p4.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Secondly</span>, due to the sequential structure of the decoder, an intermediate query refined by a stage - no matter whether this refinement brings positive or negative effects - will be cascaded to the following stages, while the query prior to the refinement never gets an opportunity to be propagated forward even though it emerges unscathed and might be more representative than the refined one. The cascading errors increase the difficulty of convergence and the sequential structure impedes the later stages from seeing prior queries during training.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Based on these intuitions, we present Query Recollection (QR) as a training strategy for query-based object detectors. It cumulatively collects intermediate queries as stages go deeper, and feeds the collected queries to the downstream stages aside from the sequential structure. By each stage, the new add-ins alongside the original inputs are independently treated among each other, so the attentions and losses are calculated individually. In such a manner, QR enjoys two key features: <span id="S1.p5.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">(1)</span> The number of supervision signals per stage grows in geometric progression, so that later stages get more supervision than the former ones, for example, the sixth stage got 32 times more supervision than the first; <span id="S1.p5.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">(2)</span> Later stages get chance to view the outputs beyond its neighboring stage for training, which mitigates the potential impact due to cascading errors. We further discover that <span id="S1.p5.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">selectively</span> forward queries to each stage, not with the entire query collection but only those from the prior two stages, can raise the number of supervision in a Fibonacci sequence which halves the extra computing cost and brings even better results. We name it Selective Query Recollection (SQR).</p>

<div id="S2.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Detectors based on dense priors have been dominating the community for decades. The abstract concept anchor box or anchor point <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>, <a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite> aims to match with ground truth (GT) objects depending on their Intersection-over-Union (IoU) values or other advanced soft scoring factors <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>, <a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>. Among anchor-based detectors, multi-stage models iteratively refine bounding box and category stage-by-stage. A typical example is Cascade RCNN <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite> which is based on the design that the output of an intermediate stage is sampled and re-labeled to train the next stage with increasing IoU thresholds, so these stages are guaranteed to be progressively refined. Recently, DETR <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite> starts a family of end-to-end query-based models where object detection is regarded as a set prediction problem.
To train DETR, a predefined number of object queries are matched to either a ground-truth or background by solving the Hungarian Matching problem. The queries are refined by several decoder stages similar to Cascade RCNN, and each intermediate stage is supervised by the matching results.</p>

<div id="S2.SS2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Recently, many algorithms have been following the idea of DETR. Deformable DETR <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">38</a>]</cite> proposes a deformable attention module that alleviates the aforementioned issues and massively improves the convergence speed by a factor of 10.
Conditional DETR <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite> decouples the object query into content query and spatial query in the decoder cross-attention module and learns a conditional spatial query from the decoder embedding to enable fast learning of the distinctive extremity of the ground-truth objects.
Anchor-DETR <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite> formulates the object queries as anchor points such that each object query may only focus on a certain region near its anchor point. Many future works are inspired by this design.
DAB-DETR <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite> dives deep into the role of object queries. It directly uses anchor box coordinates as spatial query to speed up training. The model benefits from the spatial prior by modulating the positional attention map using the width and height of the box.
DN-DETR <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite> further improves the convergence speed and query matching stability of DAB-DETR with the help of the Ground Truth denoising task.
Adamixer <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite> re-designs the query-key pooling mechanism by letting the query adaptively attend to the meaningful regions of the encoded features directly through bilinear sampling. An MLP-Mixer then dynamically decodes the pooled features into final predictions.
DETA (Detection Transformers with Assignment)<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite> proposes a novel overlap-based assignment that enables one-to-many assignments to DETR.</p>

<div id="S2.SS2.p2" class="ltx_para">

From the controlled experiments with Design I, II, III, we conclude training with emphasis on late stages is the best option. Design IV and VI are SQR with different starting stages. We show that with similar or even fewer supervisions, SQR outperforms other designs by a large margin. These comparisons verify our motivation and prove that the enhancement from SQR is not simply from the increased number of supervisions.</p>

However, SD is of vital inefficiency, because an image has to first pass through a backbone and then be processed by a varying-depth pathway, but for SQR, an image that passes through the backbone can be processed by multiple varying-depth pathways at the same time. To verify this point, we apply SD on the vanilla decoder: During training, for each mini-batch we randomly remove decoding stages following a series of pre-defined probabilities.

SQR consistently improves these models by 1.4<math id="S5.SS6.p2.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\sim" display="inline"><semantics id="S5.SS6.p2.1.m1.1a"><mo id="S5.SS6.p2.1.m1.1.1" xref="S5.SS6.p2.1.m1.1.1.cmml">∼</mo><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S5.SS6.p2.1.m1.1b"><csymbol cd="latexml" id="S5.SS6.p2.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S5.SS6.p2.1.m1.1.1">similar-to</csymbol></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S5.SS6.p2.1.m1.1c">\sim</annotation></semantics></math>2.8 AP.</p>

<p id="S5.SS7.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Herein, we explore an interesting direction enabled by Dense Query Recollection, i.e., using DQR to reduce model size. Existing methods typically have more than 6 decoding stages in decoder. Can we directly train a detector where all decoding stages share parameters? We implement this concept on vanilla Adamixer and find that the model is not able to converge. But we find DQR has the capability to achieve the goal.</p>

<div id="S6.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this work, we investigate the phenomenon where the optimal detections of query-based object detectors are not always from the last decoding stage, but can sometimes come from an intermediate decoding stage. We first recognize two limitations causing the issue, i.e. lack of training emphasis and cascading errors from query sequence. The problem is addressed by Selective Query Recollection (SQR) as a simple and effective training strategy.
Across various training settings, SQR boosts Adamixer, DAB-DETR, and Deformable-DETR by a large margin.</p>

However, the benefit cannot be replaced by extended training epochs, as already analyzed in Fig.<span id="A2.SS2.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text" style="color:#FF0000;"> 5</span>. DN-DETR is under-fitted at the 12th epoch because of its limited convergence speed and the multi-scale training setting, in this case, the mechanism of query recollection produces more supervision and speeds up the convergence of later stages. Under 50 epochs, as later stages get more supervisions and the model converges, the benefit of accelerated convergence becomes less, on the other hand, the benefit from the training emphasis and the mitigated cascading errors is less affected by the long schedule, which still brings strong improvement.</p>
