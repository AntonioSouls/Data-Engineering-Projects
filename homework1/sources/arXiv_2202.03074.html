<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">Accurate and temporally consistent modeling of human bodies
is essential for a wide range of applications, including character animation, understanding human social behavior and AR/VR interfaces. Capturing human motion accurately from a monocular image sequence is still challenging and
the modeling quality is strongly influenced by the temporal consistency of the captured body motion.
Our work presents an elegant solution for the integration of temporal constraints in the fitting process. This does not only increase temporal consistency but also robustness during the optimization.
In detail, we derive parameters of a sequence of body models, representing shape and motion of a person, including jaw poses, facial expressions, and finger poses. We optimize these parameters over the complete image sequence, fitting one consistent body shape while imposing temporal consistency on the body motion, assuming linear body joint trajectories over a short time. Our approach enables the derivation of realistic 3D body models from image sequences, including facial expression and articulated hands.
In extensive experiments, we show that our approach results in accurately estimated body shape and motion, also for challenging movements and poses. Further, we apply it to the special application of sign language analysis, where accurate and temporal consistent motion modelling is essential, and show that the approach is well-suited for this kind of application.

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Estimation of human 3D body motion and shape from monocular image sequences and videos is a challenging task in the field of computer vision and graphics.
There are many approaches addressing this problem, but most of them estimate motion and shape on a frame by frame basis without addressing temporal consistency,
and thus suffer from artifacts and inaccurate results.
There is e.g. SMPL-X <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>, which uses a parametric human shape model that is fitted to the individual frames, without explicitly accounting for temporal consistency, and which is prone to inconsistent shape and pose, leading to wiggling and jittering in the temporal sequence. These methods ignore the information of temporal vicinity present in a given image sequence or video. However, this information should be used to improve body pose and shape estimation.
</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The approach presented in this paper accurately estimates human body motion and shape from monocular image sequences, and adds temporal consistency constraints for more stable solutions.
It finds a consistent body shape for the entire image sequence and imposes temporal consistency on the body pose estimates from image to image. Our approach includes the estimation of facial expression and finger poses, which makes it suitable for highly detailed body motion estimation, such as sign language capture.
</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Possible applications of body shape and pose estimation lie in body motion tracking, character animation, understanding human social behavior and AR/VR interfaces in favor of the entertainment industry, robotics, sports analytics, medical applications and many more.
Another possible application of our approach is the generation of realistic sign language using avatars. Currently, not all media provide additional sign language. Therefore, human sign language interpreters are needed.
Automatically generated avatars, which are able to realistically and human-like emulate detailed sign language, would enable barrier-free access to all acoustically supported media.
A current state of the art approach for generating sign language motion is the employment of a deep neural network to learn from large amounts of sign language training data.
With the results of this paper, such training data can be acquired
in large quantities by accurately estimating sign language body motion from videos or image sequences.
</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">We evaluated our body pose and shape estimation approach on image sequences and videos with simple and complex body poses and motion, including sign language image sequences. Additionally, we used state of the art motion capture sequences with ground truth data for quantitative evaluation.
The experiments showed that through incorporating temporal consistency on body shape and motion, our approach yields more accurate and robust results than SMPLify-X.
Moreover, we showed that our approach not only avoids jittering artifacts and inaccuracies, but also helps to produce plausible and realistic poses and smooth body motion.

<div id="S2.p1" class="ltx_para">

<span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_subsection">2.1 </span>Fitting a Body Model to Images</h3>

<div id="S2.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Body model fitting is done on the basis of monocular camera systems, systems with multiple cameras, with depth sensors, or other configurations. The challenging task of fitting a body model to a single image without further depth information is discussed in the following.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In order to capture whole body motions, a detailed representation of the human body is needed, such as meshes or parametric body models. Parameters of the body model can be fitted using keypoints of the image, like joint locations. SMPLify-X <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite> finds body shape and pose with articulated hands and facial expression for people pictured on a single RGB image. With OpenPose <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>, 2D joint locations of the imaged people are estimated, to which the parameters of the camera and the body model SMPL-X <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite> are fitted. After an initialization phase for the camera parameters, the fitting is realized by projecting the model joints onto the image plane according to current camera properties and by minimizing the distance between projected joints and detected keypoints. At the same time, the deviation from the neutral state is penalized with pose and shape priors. An interpenetration penalty is applied to suppress body parts intersecting each other. SMPLify-X’s pose prior VPoser is realized as a variational autoencoder, which translates the body pose parameters into a normally distributed latent space. It is trained for the body model SMPL-X on a database of roughly one million recordings of common and uncommon body poses. SMPLify-X is the enhancement of SMPLify <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite> from the body model SMPL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite> to SMPL-X, which in contrast to SMPL includes articulated hands and facial expression.
The research group of SMPLify-X thereafter published ExPose <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>, a body shape and pose estimation approach which achieves similar results to SMPLify-X, but is 200 times as fast <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>. SMPL-X parameters are regressed directly, similarly learned as in Human Mesh Recovery (HMR) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>, on a new SMPL-X dataset. The parameters for hands and facial expression are regressed separately by a network using the respective image parts in high resolution. Finally, the two parameter sets are merged and fine-tuned.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Monocular full body capture in real-time is enabled by <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite>, which uses a neural network architecture consisting of residual, convolutional and fully connected modules and employs a combination of 2D and 3D keypoint positions and cropped parts of the input image for the face and hands as intermediate representation of the body.
Inter-part correlations of hands and high-level body features are used to finetune hand and finger keypoint detection.
Additionally to facial expression estimation, the cropped image is warped and projected onto the SMPL+H body model <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>.
Alternatively, a feature pyramid with different image scales can be created from the input image to derive the shape of the depicted human. This is done by <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite>, employing an encoder which takes the image and produces a feature pyramid, supervised by pixel-wise image segmentation into body parts and background, on the highest resolution feature. Then, there is a feedback loop over the feature pyramid, inside a regression network. There, model parameters of the body model SMPL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite> are estimated to mesh-image-alignment from features of increasing resolution. Due to the usage of SMPL as underlying body model, no facial expression or finger poses are estimated.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Two prevailing methods for the stated problem are HMR <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite> and Unite the People <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>, which both do not include articulated hands or facial expression. HMR learns a mapping from image pixels directly to SMPL parameters, from 2D keypoint annotated images and a large database of 3D human motion and shape, without paired data. It minimizes the reprojection loss of keypoints and uses a discriminator network. In Unite the People, a database of paired data is generated with SMPLify <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite> to train a direct regression method.</p>

<div id="S2.SS2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Analyzing an image sequence as a whole yields information about the motion, rather than the poses individually and thus about the temporal connection between the estimated poses.
The Video Inference for Human Body Pose and Shape Estimation (VIBE) approach <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite> is based on using a motion discriminator for performing body shape and pose estimation on videos or image sequences. Because SMPL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite> is used as the underlying body model, it does not include articulated hands or facial expression. VIBE exploits the large-scale motion capture dataset AMASS <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite> and in-the-wild, 2D keypoint annotated videos to train a motion discriminator model and estimate SMPL parameters. The motion discriminator is trained like a generative adversarial network, with two separate neural networks.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Similar to our approach, Monocular Total Capture (MTC) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite> captures body shape and pose, including expressive hands and face, of a person depicted in a monocular image sequence, represented by a 3D deformable mesh body model and uses one shared shape vector for the whole image sequence. For every image, the joint confidence maps and 3D orientation of body parts are estimated with a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), which are described as 3D Part Orientation Fields (POFs). The POFs are used to optimize the parameters of the body model ADAM <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>, employing the pose and shape prior from the CMU Graphics Lab Motion Capture
Database <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>.
For temporal consistency, a texture-based tracking method is utilized, using optical flow. It refines the body model parameters based on the previous image, its parameters, and the parameters of the current image.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS2.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">An approach concentrating on articulated hands on monocular videos is FrankMocap <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>. The poses and shapes of the hands are estimated separately from the body and are merged afterwards, as in ExPose. Body pose and hands are both modelled with SMPL-X, thus FrankMocap includes expressive face and articulated hands.
Switching between methods to iteratively estimate shape and pose in an ongoing loop is an alternative approach for the given problem. SPIN <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite> switches between the deep regression network of HMR and an iterative optimization routine, using SMPLify <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>, to improve the accuracy of body shape and motion estimation. Due to choosing SMPL as the body model, SPIN does not include expressive face or articulated hands.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS2.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS2.p4.1" class="ltx_p">For temporally consistent capturing of the human body pose and shape including clothes and texture, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite> uses a cascaded network architecture of image encoders and Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs). First, a Temporal Voxel Regression Network (TVRN) produces temporally consistent voxel occupancy grids for every frame. Then, this is used by a geometry prediction network (H3DN) to refine the surface 3D reconstruction, by acquiring a multi-scale shape encoding. Afterwards, a texture prediction network (H3DTexN) is used to predict a color value for each surface vertex. Using a modified residual neural network (ResNet), pixel-wise image features are acquired, which are processed in an MLP decoder for every frame but with shared parameters, again acquiring a multi-scale shape encoding. This produces a textured 3D surface that captures finger pose and facial expression, but not in great detail.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS2.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS2.p5.1" class="ltx_p">To capture humans in challenging poses and motion,
ChallenCap <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite> uses a learning-and-optimization framework, which learns motion characteristics and is trained on “a new challenging human motion dataset with both unsynchronized marker-based and light-weight multi-image references” <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>.
First, a noisy skeletal motion map is acquired, this is then processed in their temporal encoder-decoder and generation network HybridNet and their motion discriminator, which is followed by a robust motion optimization phase, which uses 2D keypoint and silhouette information from the video frames. This approach needs a 3D body scanned template mesh of the actor as input, besides the video frames, and does not capture facial expression or finger poses.</p>

<div id="S2.SS2.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS2.p6.1" class="ltx_p">Pure human pose estimation from image sequences or videos, outputting only a skeleton of joints instead of estimating the person’s body shape, is another challenging research area.
A recent overview of deep learning based approaches to this task is provided by <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite>. Almost 300 publications on 2D and 3D body pose estimation, related datasets and evaluation metrics are analyzed, discussed and compared. In addition, remaining challenges such as occlusion, computational efficiency, and insufficient training data are identified.
One of those publications is <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>, which performs pure 3D human pose estimation and uses a fully convolutional model, which consists of dilated temporal convolutions over 2D keypoints to capture long-term information. They propose to use this for applications where labeled data is scarce to enable semi-supervised learning on unlabeled video using a reprojection loss, similar to this paper.
<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite> performs skeleton-based action recognition and adopts the possible dependencies of physically connected and disconnected joints and the hierarchical structure in the skeleton to better model the spatial and temporal features of human actions. It employs a spatial-temporal module which contains motif-based graph convolutional networks (GCNs), which work on graphs having human body joints as nodes and bones as edges, and which contain a variable temporal dense block to encode short-, mid and long-range local information. In the last stages of the network, a non-local neural network module for global temporal features is used, with the aid of an attention mechanism.</p>

<p id="S2.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">This work presents a method for temporally consistent human body shape and motion estimation by fitting SMPL-X parameters to a monocular image sequence. It estimates 2D joint location keypoints bottom-up and then fits SMPL-X parameters to the keypoints top-down in an optimization framework. A consistent shape is found by estimating one shared shape parameter vector for the whole image sequence.
Following, the body motion is estimated accurately by imposition of temporal consistency. For this purpose, we minimize objective functions, which consist of a reprojection loss term, a number of pose and shape priors and loss terms for temporally consistent body shape and motion.</p>

However, VIBE does not include expressive face and articulated hands and MTC does not focus on shape fitting and uses a gender non-specific body model, in contrast to our work. Therefore, our approach surpasses the other two in capturing people naturally and accurately, including detailed finger movements, emotional countenance, expressive gestures and a diverse spectrum of gender-specific body shape.
In comparison to SMPLify-X, our approach exploits the context of temporally neighboring frames to provide body models which are temporally consistent in shape and motion.</p>

Finally, in phase 3, the SMPL-X parameters are optimized along the sequence for temporally consistent body motion (Sec. <a href="#S3.SS3" title="3.3 Phase 3: Temporal Consistency on all Images ‣ 3 Temporally Consistent Shape and Pose Fitting ‣ Imposing Temporal Consistency on Deep Monocular Body Shape and Pose Estimation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3.3</span></a>).</p>

since it includes facial expression and articulated hands. SMPL-X uses the following parameters: human body shape, general pose, finger poses, jaw pose, facial expression, and global rotation of the model.
Finally, the camera center
is also a parameter of interest for our approach. </p>

at the beginning of the five stages, primarily body model parameters are strongly regulated with priors to achieve realistic human motion. As the stages progress, priors for jaw pose and inhibiting overbending of knees and elbows gain weight in relation to the rest.

Quantitative evaluation includes body shape evaluation by comparing volumes of the estimated body models to volumes of ground truth meshes, which were captured using a marker-based motion capture system.

The three subjects 17, 1 and 32 have average body volume, while subjects 41 and 16 have higher and subject 45 has lower body volume than average.
In the videos of the motion capture dataset, all subjects are depicted from a slight side view and perform the same 21 body motions. Two of these motions were selected for further quantitative and qualitative evaluation in our work. Hand waving was chosen as a simple motion for body shape and pose estimation, which is from here on referred to as <span id="S4.SS1.p4.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Simple Motion</span>, and sitting down cross-legged and standing up again as a difficult one, which is from here on called <span id="S4.SS1.p4.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Complex Motion</span>.

In some instances for these subjects, MoVi starts the motion capture process slightly later inside the video or stops it slightly earlier than our work started and ended the image sequences, thereby some frames at the end or beginning of the image sequence have no corresponding ground truth result.</p>

While our approach achieves a consistent body shape, shape and pose estimated by SMPLify-X changes significantly, resulting in an inaccurate body shape. For the sake of completeness, we also show VIBE results here, but note that the comparison lacks as VIBE dose not include hands as well as expressive face.

<p id="S4.SS2.SSS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Similarly for both Simple and Complex Motion, as they were defined in Sec. <a href="#S4.SS1" title="4.1 Setting ‣ 4 Evaluation ‣ Imposing Temporal Consistency on Deep Monocular Body Shape and Pose Estimation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4.1</span></a>, our work derives more accurate estimates than SMPLify-X. This becomes apparent e.g. in Fig. <a href="#S4.F6" title="Figure 6 ‣ 4.2.1 Qualitative Analysis ‣ 4.2 Shape Fitting Evaluation ‣ 4 Evaluation ‣ Imposing Temporal Consistency on Deep Monocular Body Shape and Pose Estimation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">6</span></a>, which shows subject 1 in the MoVi dataset performing Complex Motion, the ground truth body model, which was captured with AMASS and the body model estimates from our work and from SMPLify-X. It can be seen that SMPLify-X estimates a body shape and camera center resulting in a distorted body model being over 2m high in chrouching pose and more than 2.5 times as high as the ground truth model, while our work’s method captures the body shape and pose accurately.
Moreover, in Fig. <a href="#S4.F6" title="Figure 6 ‣ 4.2.1 Qualitative Analysis ‣ 4.2 Shape Fitting Evaluation ‣ 4 Evaluation ‣ Imposing Temporal Consistency on Deep Monocular Body Shape and Pose Estimation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">6</span></a>, one can see that the distance to the camera also remains consistent in time in our approach. This can be attributed to the forced shape consistency together with the keypoint reprojection.</p>

SMPLify-X produces body models with big deviations from ground truth and with the most inaccurate volumes in the first third and towards the end of the image sequence. One frame corresponding to the first peak for Complex Motion of subject 45 is shown in Fig. <a href="#S4.F9" title="Figure 9 ‣ 4.3.1 Qualitative Analysis ‣ 4.3 Temporal Consistency Evaluation ‣ 4 Evaluation ‣ Imposing Temporal Consistency on Deep Monocular Body Shape and Pose Estimation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">9</span></a> and one frame corresponding to the second peak in Fig. <a href="#S4.F6" title="Figure 6 ‣ 4.2.1 Qualitative Analysis ‣ 4.2 Shape Fitting Evaluation ‣ 4 Evaluation ‣ Imposing Temporal Consistency on Deep Monocular Body Shape and Pose Estimation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">6</span></a>.
Analysis of these frames with high SMPLify-X mean volume error
reveals that this is the moment where the subjects put one hand on the floor to sit down. The other peak in the volume results for Complex Motion occurs at the moment where, while standing up, the last hand loses contact to the ground.

The reasoning behind some figures not having data for a few frames at the beginning or end of an image sequence, was given in Sec. <a href="#S4.SS1" title="4.1 Setting ‣ 4 Evaluation ‣ Imposing Temporal Consistency on Deep Monocular Body Shape and Pose Estimation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4.1</span></a>.</p>

<p id="S4.SS2.SSS2.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Because our approach calculates one shape for a whole image sequence and only allows changes of the pose for the individual frames, it is guaranteed that the shape is consistent over time and still adapted to the subject. In contrast to this, SMPLify-X calculates an individual body shape for each frame, which is independent of predecessor and successor frames and thus varies drastically from frame to frame in some instances, which became evident in this section’s results.</p>

The first half of the video shows general hand movements and the second half shows sign language motion. Overall, our approach is able to prevent the jittering of motion and shape changes generated by SMPLify-X.
Furthermore, at the beginning, the hand movement estimates look similarly accurate; detailed results can be seen in Fig. <a href="#S4.F5" title="Figure 5 ‣ 4.2.1 Qualitative Analysis ‣ 4.2 Shape Fitting Evaluation ‣ 4 Evaluation ‣ Imposing Temporal Consistency on Deep Monocular Body Shape and Pose Estimation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5</span></a>. The results show that our approach prohibits extremely changing arm poses found in SMPLify-X, which do not describe the depicted motion, up to having both arms behind the head as well as wobbling of the legs noticeable for SMPLify-X. For complex hand motions of sign language, the impact of implementing temporal and shape consistency becomes very clear, since our approach is able to produce consistent results, but SMPLify-X fails to consistently produce accurate results.</p>

Mean and standard deviation of the vertex-to-surface error for both motions are significantly lower for our work’s method than for SMPLify-X.
The estimation of the Simple Motion sequences undergoes improvement, but those of the Complex Motion sequences are especially strongly refined.
This shows a strong and comprehensive improvement in pose estimation by introducing shape and temporal consistency.

<p id="S5.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Evaluation of the imposition of temporal consistency on body motion, in addition to shape consistency, revealed that our approach enables accurate derivation of complex body poses and partially self-occluded bodies.
It was able to resolve the wobbling of shape and motion which was seen for SMPLify-X’s results.
Instead, our approach resulted in smooth body motion, which was also quantitatively shown to be closer to the ground truth meshes.</p>

<p id="S5.p4.1" class="ltx_p">In addition, we discovered that imposing shape and temporal consistency together leads to a temporally consistent behaviour of the distance between body model and camera.

<span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_section">6 </span>Conclusion</h2>

<div id="S6.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We applied our approach for accurate estimation of body shape and motion to challenging tasks, such as estimation of intricate body motion or sign language capture, where correct timing and smooth motion are extremely important for both expressiveness as well as acceptance.
Based on quantitative and qualitative analysis, it can be concluded that imposing shape and temporal consistency significantly improves the accuracy of estimated body models.
Therefore, it is e.g. suitable for the task of generating training data for realistic sign language reproduction from real image sequences or videos.
This enables sign language support for arbitrary videos using artificial avatars, allowing a more inclusive access to many forms of media.
Accurate body shape and motion estimation can furthermore be used in a variety of other contexts, like understanding of human social behavior or body motion tracking for the entertainment industry, robotics, sports analytics, medical applications and many more.
</p>
</div>
<div id="S6.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p2.1" class="ltx_p">As could be seen in some qualitative and quantitative evaluation, SMPLify-X is able to derive an accurate body shape and pose from images in many cases but shows inaccuracies for some scenarios and a general jittering of body motion, since it processes every frame without the rest of the image sequence as context. These inaccuracies and jittering were dissolved to a great extent by the approach presented in this paper.
The introduction of temporal and shape consistency to body pose estimation thus enables capturing motion realistically steady and smooth.</p>
