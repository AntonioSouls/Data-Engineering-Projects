International guideline provides treatment recommendations; however, the importance and effect of the different treatments are not fully explored. The available data is collected in Tanzania, during newborn resuscitation, for analysis of the resuscitation activities and the response of the newborn.

</span>Methods:<span id="id1.id1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_upright"> The available recordings are noisy real-world videos with large variations. We propose a two-step process in order to detect activities possibly overlapping in time. The first step is to detect and track the relevant objects, like bag-mask resuscitator, heart rate sensors etc., and the second step is to use this information to recognize the resuscitation activities. The topic of this paper is the first step, and the object detection and tracking are based on convolutional neural networks followed by post processing.
</span>Results:<span id="id1.id1.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_upright"> The performance of the object detection during activities were 96.97 % (ventilations), 100 % (attaching/removing heart rate sensor) and 75 % (suction) on a test set of 20 videos. The system also estimate the number of health care providers present with a performance of 71.16 %.
</span>Conclusion:<span id="id1.id1.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_upright"> The proposed object detection and tracking system provides promising results in noisy newborn resuscitation videos.
</span>Significance:<span id="id1.id1.1.5" class="ltx_text ltx_font_upright"> This is the first step in a thorough analysis of newborn resuscitation episodes, which could provide important insight about the importance and effect of different newborn resuscitation activities.

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Globally, one million newborns die within the first 24 hours of life each year. Most of these deaths are caused by complications during birth and birth asphyxia, and the mortality rates are highest in low-income countries <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. As many as 10-20 % of newborns require assistance to begin breathing and recognition of birth asphyxia and initiation of newborn resuscitation is crucial for survival <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>. International guidelines on newborn resuscitation exists, however, the importance and effect of the different treatments and therapeutic activities are not fully explored.</p>

<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Safer Births<span id="footnote1b" class="ltx_note ltx_role_footnote"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">1</sup><span class="ltx_note_outer"><span class="ltx_note_content"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">1</sup><span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_note">1</span>www.saferbirths.com</span></span></span> is a research project to establish new knowledge on how to save lives at birth, and the project has, among other things, collected data during newborn resuscitation episodes at Haydom Lutheran Hospital in Tanzania since 2013.
The collected data contains video recordings, ECG and accelerometer measurements from a heart rate sensor (HRS) attached to the newborn, and measurements of pressure, flow and expired CO<sub id="S1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_sub">2</sub> from a bag-mask resuscitator (BMR).
A thorough analysis of the collected data could provide important insight about different effects of the resuscitation
activities.
To be able to study such effects it is necessary to quantify the series of performed activities, in addition to measuring the condition of the newborn during resuscitation and knowing the outcome. A timeline documenting activities like ventilation, stimulation and suction would be of immense value. From such a timeline it would be possible to extract parameters like the amount of both total and continuous time used, the number of starts and stops for different activities etc. The generation of the timelines should preferably be done automatically by using the collected signals and/or video, thus allowing large amounts of data to be analyzed. The value of such timelines would clearly be i) for research and increased knowledge on the effects of newborn resuscitation activities. A future implementation of a complete system would also be useful on-site: ii) as a debriefing tool, summarizing the activities with no need to study video recordings and iii) as a real-time feedback system.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Previously, in Huyen et.al <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>, our research group
proposed an activity detector based on the HRS signals and the detector discriminated the activities <span id="S1.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">stimulation</span>, <span id="S1.p3.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">chest compressions</span> and <span id="S1.p3.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">other</span> with a accuracy of 78.7 %.
Stimulation and chest compressions are therapeutic activities, whereas <span id="S1.p3.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">other</span> would include moving and drying the baby, touching the HRS etc. These activities would result in movement in the HRS, and thus be visible in both the ECG and the accelerometer signals, but are not considered therapeutic activities or treatment of the newborn.
Using automatic video analysis of the video recordings during the resuscitation episodes could potentially improve the performance achieved using the HRS signals. Furthermore, video analysis could possibly detect activities and information that are difficult or impossible to detect from the ECG and accelerometer signals, like; is the HRS attached to the newborn or not, and how many health care providers (HCPs) are present.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">The importance of video analysis of newborn resuscitation episodes has been well documented for both evaluation and training purposes
<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>. However, manual inspection and annotation is very time consuming, and limits the amount of data that can be analyzed. In addition, a manual inspection entails privacy issues.
Thus, there is a need for automatic video analysis of these episodes.
Conventional image and pattern recognition methods, e.g segmentation and tracking, has been applied in automatic video analysis for decades <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>, but in recent years Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) has shown it‘s superior strength in the field <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>. In the topic of object and activity detection in resuscitation in general, others have propose the usage of passive radio-frequency identification (RFID) tags on the objects for object motion and interaction detection <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>. Chakraborty et.al <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite> proposed an object and activity detector for trauma resuscitation video recordings based on object segmentation and a Markov Logic Network model.
In the area of <span id="S1.p4.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">newborn</span> resuscitation Guo et.al <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite> proposed an activity detection system for newborn resuscitation videos based on DNN and linear Support-Vector Machines (SVMs). Their dataset included 17 videos recorded with a frame rate of 25 frames per second (FPS) at a hospital in Nepal,
and the group aimed to detect the activities <span id="S1.p4.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">stimulation</span>, <span id="S1.p4.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">suction</span>, <span id="S1.p4.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">ventilation</span> and <span id="S1.p4.1.5" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">crying</span>. The pre-trained <span id="S1.p4.1.6" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Faster RCNN</span> network and the object class <span id="S1.p4.1.7" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">People</span> were used to propose areas involving the newborn, and motion salient areas were further used as input to two pre-trained Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) from <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite> designed to extract motion and spatial features. Further, the features was combined and used as input to linear SVMs, trained on their own dataset, to detect the activities.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">All though there are similarities between the dataset from <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite> and our dataset, they are both noisy real-world videos with large variations, there are some specific tasks an challenges that differs between the studies. First, we aim to detect activities that are not newborn location dependent or movement dependent, like, the number of HCP present, and is the HRS attached or not. Second, in our dataset the newborns are wrapped in blankets most of the time, even before being placed at the resuscitation table, and the image examples from <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>, which shows fully uncovered newborns, are more infrequent in our dataset. Thus, using a pre-trained <span id="S1.p5.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Person</span> detection network as suggested in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite> would most likely not be the best approach. In addition, our videos are recorded with variable frame rate, which in some case are very low and causes motion blurred images of poor quality, resulting in larger per frame motion variations than for images recorded with fixed frame rates. Considering all this, we believe that using an object detection and tracking approach to localize the relevant activity detection areas would be a more robust first step in activity detection.
Further, using the areas around each objects would simplify the detection problem to a binary classification problem for the specific activities; is the object being used in resuscitation or not. The topic of this paper is the first step and the object detection and tracking is based on CNNs followed by post processing. Neural networks for object detection requires a lot of training data, so in addition to using image frames from the videos, we use histogram matching <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite> for augmentation and also a synthetic dataset. The object detection is performed on each video frame and here we use the well known <span id="S1.p5.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">YOLOv3</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite> network, used in various object detection applications <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>, <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>, <a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>. Post processing is used to fill in missing detections and track the area around the objects during the episodes.</p>

All these variations, especially the variable frame rate, make automatic video analysis more challenging.

and finally, 4)
due to the limited size of labelled training data, using transfer learning with a-state-of-the-art model as YOLOv3 as the starting point will most likely outperform any training from scratch.</p>

<p id="S4.p3.1" class="ltx_p">The main task of the object detection and tracking is to find approximate regions around the objects that can be used for further activity recognition. The aim is not to propose very accurate regions that centers the object perfectly, but more importantly to propose smoothly updated regions that surround the object over time. Thus, we classify a tracking result as correct if the object is at least 50 % included in the proposed region.</p>

Since the objects often are occluded in the videos and the camera distance varies, the objects‘s size and form have large variations. Therefore, we have chosen to use the YOLOv3 anchor boxes determined using k-means clustering on the large COCO dataset <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite> instead of estimating anchor boxes from our limited truth data.</p>

<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The proposed system shows promising results for object detection and tracking in noisy real-world videos of a newborn resuscitation scene. As proposed in Figure <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ I Introduction ‣ Object Detection During Newborn Resuscitation Activities" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a> the areas around the objects will be used as input to sequential neural networks trained to recognize the different activities by analyzing the areas for short time sequences. Other relevant areas like the area around the newborn, which could be found from the detected hand movements, and around the detected HCPHs can also be used as inputs to the sequential analysis.</p>
</div>
<div id="S6.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Due to the suction penguins transparency and small size, the system struggles with detecting it in some of the episodes. Especially in videos with low frame rate and motion blurred images it could be very difficult to detect a SP held in the hand of a health care provider. In additon, the system also has problem detecting the SP in unfocused video sequences and in activity sequences with large occlusions.
Using the sub-image approach and the <span id="S6.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">SplitD</span> model improved the detections of the SP. This suggests that it could be possible to further improve the results by experimenting with the size and cropping of training examples. In addition, we could experiment with the generation of the synthetic data to see if it is possible to generate more realistic examples.</p>
</div>
<div id="S6.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p3.1" class="ltx_p">In future recordings the problem with detection of SP could be solved by using fixed camera settings, focus, frame rate and distance from resuscitation tables and by using two camera angles to avoid occlusion.</p>
</div>
<div id="S6.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p4.1" class="ltx_p">The performance of detected number of HCPs present in the video is very good for zero and one HCP present, but the system struggles to detect the number of HCPs when there are more than one HCPs present. Instead, in cases of false detection, these are mostly being mislabeled as one HCPs less than the reference data shows. The cause for this is a mixture of variations in the dataset and of camera angles. The system performs worse when the HCPs are not wearing rubber gloves, suggesting the need for more training examples from similar episodes. The cameras are also often placed in a side-position where the HCPs occludes other HCPs and hands. Training the network to discriminate between left and right hands could also improve the performance of the detected number of HCPs present in the videos.</p>

<p id="S7.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The proposed system shows promising object detection and tracking results in noisy real-world videos. The object detection performance during activities was 97 % on ventilation, 100 % on attaching or removing heart rate sensor and 75 % on suction. The system also estimate the number of health care providers (HCP) present with an accuracy of 71 %.</p>
</div>
<div id="S7.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S7.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In future work we will
investigate the possibility of discriminating between left and right HCP hands and implementing hand tracking to improve the performance of the estimated number of HCP.
We will also experiment with different network structures and training data to try to improve the detection of the suction device, in addition to increasing the amount of training data in general to get a better overall detection performance.
Further, we will continue with step two of the planned system: inputting the proposed object areas to sequential neural networks to detect the resuscitation activities.
This will produce timelines useful for quantifying the use of different resuscitation activities, which could further provide new knowledge on the effects of activities on newborn resuscitation outcome.
In the future, such a system could also be implemented on-site as a post-resuscitation debriefing tool, and/or for real-time feedback and decision support during newborn resuscitation. The latter would require a very high-performance system.</p>
