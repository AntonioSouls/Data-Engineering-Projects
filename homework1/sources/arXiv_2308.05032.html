<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">One of the important bottlenecks in training modern object detectors is the need for labeled images where bounding box annotations have to be produced for each object present in the image. This bottleneck is further exacerbated in aerial images where the annotators have to label small objects often distributed in clusters on high-resolution images. In recent days, the mean-teacher approach trained with pseudo-labels and weak-strong augmentation consistency is gaining popularity for semi-supervised object detection. However, a direct adaptation of such semi-supervised detectors for aerial images where small clustered objects are often present, might not lead to optimal results. In this paper, we propose a density crop-guided semi-supervised detector that identifies the cluster of small objects during training and also exploits them to improve performance at inference. During training, image crops of clusters identified from labeled and unlabeled images are used to augment the training set, which in turn increases the chance of detecting small objects and creating good pseudo-labels for small objects on the unlabeled images. During inference, the detector is not only able to detect the objects of interest but also regions with a high density of small objects (density crops) so that detections from the input image and detections from image crops are combined, resulting in an overall more accurate object prediction, especially for small objects. Empirical studies on the popular benchmarks of VisDrone and DOTA datasets show the effectiveness of our density crop-guided semi-supervised detector with an average improvement of more than 2% over the basic mean-teacher method in COCO style AP.

<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">With abundant labeled data and efficient deep learning algorithms, supervised object detection has achieved impressive results in natural images <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib43" title="" class="ltx_ref">43</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite>. Though the progress is also resonated in Aerial Image object detection with images captured by drones and satellites<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib45" title="" class="ltx_ref">45</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite>, we are yet to see large-scale annotated datasets like Pascal VOC <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>, MS-COCO <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite> and Open Images<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite> in aerial images. Getting sufficient labeled data is difficult in aerial images, especially at instance-level recognition tasks like object detection <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib46" title="" class="ltx_ref">46</a>, <a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>, <a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite>, limiting the scalability of the popular supervised detectors to aerial images. The annotation of several tiny objects per image is a tedious task <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib49" title="" class="ltx_ref">49</a>]</cite>.
This puts more demand on learning object detectors with limited annotations in aerial image detection. Practical applications with aerial imagery produce large amounts of unlabeled data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib40" title="" class="ltx_ref">40</a>, <a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">39</a>]</cite> but they are simply not utilized in the learning process. Therefore, it is important to leverage the available unlabeled data to train the detectors for aerial image detection.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">To train a detector with limited annotated images and a large collection of unlabeled data, we focus on training them in a semi-supervised setting. Although semi-supervised object detection (SSOD) has achieved tremendous progress in recent years on natural images <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>, <a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>, <a href="#bib.bib46" title="" class="ltx_ref">46</a>, <a href="#bib.bib41" title="" class="ltx_ref">41</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">38</a>, <a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite>, we are yet to see large-scale adoption of them on aerial images. While adapting the best SSOD techniques on natural images to aerial images, one should be cautious due to the large difference in these images. Specifically, factors like the high-resolution nature of the imagery, the small size of the objects, and their sparse distribution across the image need consideration. The number of target objects is also fairly high in aerial images compared to natural images. For example, the average number of objects in Pascal VOC and MS-COCO images are 3 and 7, respectively, whereas the images in the VisDrone <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib49" title="" class="ltx_ref">49</a>]</cite> and DOTA <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib45" title="" class="ltx_ref">45</a>]</cite> datasets, two popular benchmarks in aerial detection research, have an average number of 53 and 67 objects, respectively. A naive adaptation of semi-supervised detectors based on pseudo-labels, in this case, is not labeling enough small objects in the unlabeled images as shown in figure <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ I Introduction ‣ Density Crop-guided Semi-supervised Object Detection in Aerial Images" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a> right. We hypothesize that these difficulties contributed to the lower adoption rate of semi-supervised detectors in aerial image detection. To the best of our knowledge, we are yet to see a large-scale study of the recent semi-supervised detectors in aerial images.</p>

<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">In supervised settings, even with a fully annotated training set, vanilla object detectors still struggle to accurately localize the small objects in high-resolution aerial images. Thus additional techniques for performance enhancement are often used including density-guided detection
<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>, scale-specific detectors <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>, <a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>]</cite>, feature fusion <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>, <a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite>, attention methods <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib47" title="" class="ltx_ref">47</a>]</cite> etc. Among these, density crop-based approaches are popular as they process the cluster of small objects by zooming in on the crops obtained from there, resulting in better small object detection. To bring the same benefits to the semi-supervised settings, we designed our semi-supervised detector with density crop-guided training and inference. Although density crops can be used in supervised settings with external learnable modules and additional loss functions <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib48" title="" class="ltx_ref">48</a>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>, using them in semi-supervised settings with mean-teacher method <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib42" title="" class="ltx_ref">42</a>]</cite> is not straightforward. The external module may need additional loss functions, and often times they are trained before the detector with sufficient labeled data. Also, it is not immediately clear how to construct pseudo-labels for the density extraction module if one wants to train them in the mean-teacher settings using unlabeled images. Thus, in our case, we want to identify the density crops from the detector’s prediction itself. For this, we used a cascade zoom-in detector (CZ Detector) design that learns to predict density crops as an additional class in addition to the base class objects. The CZ detector was introduced in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite>. In this work, we extend the CZ detector in order to exploit additional unsupervised data present in a semi-supervised setting. We show that a simple adaptation of the CZ detector for semi-supervised learning would not work and that some additional care is needed. Thus, experiments on two different datasets and meaningful ablation are reported that show the advantages of the proposed approach.</p>

<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">With the CZ detector, density crops can be identified on the labeled and unlabeled images. For the labeled images, they are identified a priori with the available ground-truth (GT) labels. For the unlabeled images, pseudo-GT predictions are utilized to locate the cluster of small objects and then labeled as density crops. The crops identified on both labeled and unlabeled images are used to augment the training set. The augmented crops result in more samples of small objects seen at higher pixel resolution, improving their detection chance. This is due to more pseudo-labels created on the unlabeled images (figure <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ I Introduction ‣ Density Crop-guided Semi-supervised Object Detection in Aerial Images" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a> right) compared to the vanilla mean-teacher method. The detector is then trained in the mean-teacher fashion with weak-strong augmentation consistency and pseudo labels for the unlabeled images. At inference, detection is performed separately on both the input image and upscaled density crops if any are present in that image. They are then fused and post-processed to get the final results. As the training and inference with crops here are relying only on the detector itself, their semi-supervised adaptation becomes easier. Figure <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ I Introduction ‣ Density Crop-guided Semi-supervised Object Detection in Aerial Images" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a> left shows how density crops are improving AP detection on the VisDrone dataset. It can be observed that by utilizing the density crops effectively in the semi-supervised settings, our detection accuracy increases significantly over the vanilla semi-supervised detector, as in the fully supervised settings.</p>

Generic object detectors have achieved impressive progress in recent years on object detection tasks in natural images <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>, <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>, <a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>, <a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite> object detectors. This has resulted in wider adoption of them in practical applications. With aerial images, Faster RCNN based detectors are widely used as they tend to be more accurate due to potential object region extraction performed in the first stage <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib48" title="" class="ltx_ref">48</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>. Recently, one-stage detectors are being explored in aerial images <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib47" title="" class="ltx_ref">47</a>]</cite>. These days, anchor-free detectors <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib43" title="" class="ltx_ref">43</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite> are getting popular, since they avoid the need for hand-crafted anchor box dimensions and their matching process. Anchor-based matching is difficult with small objects as the overlap values are low for small bounding boxes. Though appealing, the anchor-free detectors are still challenging to use in semi-supervised settings as they produce many noisy pseudo labels <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>. This might result in substantial modifications to the backbone detector and additional loss functions. To avoid further challenges in terms of adapting the backbone detector, in this paper, we used the Faster RCNN detector which has shown excellent results in the existing works <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib48" title="" class="ltx_ref">48</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>.</p>

Semi-supervised object detectors are trained on a small set of labeled images and a large collection of unlabeled images <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib41" title="" class="ltx_ref">41</a>]</cite>. They have been explored in many different forms. The dominant approaches for semi-supervised object detection in the past were consistency regularization or pseudo-label based<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">38</a>, <a href="#bib.bib46" title="" class="ltx_ref">46</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>. But recently, the mean-teacher method became very popular in object detection which combines both approaches, resulting in state-of-the-art results<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>, <a href="#bib.bib41" title="" class="ltx_ref">41</a>, <a href="#bib.bib46" title="" class="ltx_ref">46</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">38</a>]</cite>. In this setting, a student network is trained to optimize the combined supervised and unsupervised loss. The supervised loss is the standard detection loss. The unsupervised loss forces the student network to make consistent predictions with a weak and strong augmented version of an unlabeled image. It is implemented by using pseudo labels from a teacher network which temporally accumulates the student network weights in an exponential moving average (EMA) fashion. Initially successful in two-stage detectors, the mean-teacher method is now getting popular with one-stage detectors too <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>. While existing semi-supervised detectors adapt the mean-teacher method to fit different requirements, we focus on adapting the mean-teacher detector to the small object detection setting. To this end, we propose a density crop-guided semi-supervised detector.</p>

Small object detection is getting popular these days with the large-scale availability of drone and satellite images. Cheng et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite> provides a comprehensive survey of small object detection techniques which is broadly classified into: scale aware training <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>, <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>, <a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>, <a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>]</cite>, super-resolution methods <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>, context modeling <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>, and density guided detection <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>, <a href="#bib.bib48" title="" class="ltx_ref">48</a>]</cite> among others. In aerial images, the small objects are distributed in clusters at sparse locations, so density cropping based approaches have shown excellent results <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib48" title="" class="ltx_ref">48</a>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>. Thus we also used density crop-guided detection for improving the small object detection in this work. Different from others, we trained the density-based detector in semi-supervised settings. As most of the density-based detectors are trained with additional density extraction modules and loss functions, they cannot fit in the mean-teacher semi-supervised framework. So we used a density-based approach that performs density crop extraction within the detector itself. By doing so, we can easily adapt the mean-teacher semi-supervised training to incorporate small object detection guided by object density.</p>

<p id="S3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this section, we discuss the formulation of our semi-supervised zoom-in detection in detail. First, we present how we leverage the density crops for small object detection within the object detector using the zoom-in design. This design avoids the need for additional modules to get density crops simplifying the subsequent semi-supervised detector learning. Then we present the semi-supervised detection in detail with the teacher-student learning paradigm (mean-teacher method). We present how density crops are used in semi-supervised settings where crops are identified on labeled and unlabeled images. While for the labeled images, the original GT annotation can be used, for the unlabeled images, we rely on the detection prediction. As the majority of the images are unlabeled in the standard semi-supervised settings, without using them we’ll be limited to a few samples for the crop class.

<p id="S3.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The zoom-in object detector helps us to zoom in on dense image regions containing cluster of small objects and detect them with better localization accuracy. It does the zoom-in operation like detecting any other class in the dataset, allowing us to use the detector off the shelf. - In this section, we will explain the working of zoom-in detection in detail. The first component of the zoom-in detector is the density crop labeling algorithm that labels the dense image regions as “density crops” and augments the training data by adding up-scaled versions of those crops. For the labeled data, we use the available GT boxes for the crop labeling. For the unlabeled data, we rely on pseudo labels for crop labeling. Then, the density crops are added to the set of target objects to be detected on each image. The zoom-in detector is then trained in the mean-teacher fashion. The inference is performed in two stages. In the first stage, we detect base class objects and “dense crops” on the input image. In the second stage, the obtained dense image regions are up-scaled and a second detection is performed on them. This will help us to detect those small objects in the crowded image regions. A fusion operation is then performed by merging the detections on the input image and its dense regions which will be explained later.</p>

an up-scaled version of the density crops, and the loss is computed against the target small objects in the crop. As we have the small objects in higher pixel resolution in the up-scaled version, the detector can recognize them easily. Note that in the original input where we resize the image to the detector’s maximum training resolution, the small objects from these crowded dense regions are mostly missed by the detector. But when we process the up-scaled density crops, we improve the chance of detecting them.

We followed the scale ranges provided in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite> for the strong augmentation. The augmented images then go through the mean-teacher semi-supervised learning process. We followed <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite> for the mean-teacher training implementation. We compute density crops on the unlabeled images using pseudo-labels from the teacher. This is then used to augment more crops, this time from the unlabeled images. In the following, we will describe the semi-supervised learning process in detail.</p>

The semi-supervised training is then continued as before but with more unlabeled datapoints obtained from the cluster of small objects in the unlabeled images. As the clusters mostly remain intact on the unlabeled images at this point, it is not necessary to recompute them at every iteration. We recomputed them at every 10,000 iterations to make the training faster.</p>

<p id="S4.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We analyzed the effectiveness of our semi-supervised learning method by using partially labeled data from the train set of VisDrone and DOTA datasets. In particular, we used 1%, 5%, and 10% randomly chosen data points from the train set as labeled data and the remaining as unlabeled for the semi-supervised training. There are five settings in the comparison; supervised baseline, supervised baseline with density crops (Supervised + Crop), semi-supervised with the mean teacher (SSOD), SSOD with density crops on labeled images (SSOD + Crop (L)), and SSOD with density crops on labeled and unlabeled images (SSOD + Crop (L + U)). These settings progressively assess the impact of the components of our density crop-guided semi-supervised object detection.</p>

It can be observed that <span id="S4.SS1.p2.2.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">AP</span> is improved by more than 6% in all cases with our density-guided SSOD over their supervised baseline. Compared to the vanilla mean-teacher method (SSOD), our density crop-guided SSOD shows an average improvement of more than 2% on all metrics. Compared to 1% and 5% cases, with very limited labeled samples per class, 10% shows a better boost in performance while leveraging density crops with SSOD. Another interesting result is that the improved performance with semi-supervised learning for 1% settings is more than that of supervised training with 5% labels and 2% below with the 10% labels. This is achieved with less than 100 labeled samples. <math id="S4.SS1.p2.2.m2.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\textrm{AP}_{50}" display="inline"><semantics id="S4.SS1.p2.2.m2.1a"><msub id="S4.SS1.p2.2.m2.1.1" xref="S4.SS1.p2.2.m2.1.1.cmml"><mtext id="S4.SS1.p2.2.m2.1.1.2" xref="S4.SS1.p2.2.m2.1.1.2a.cmml">AP</mtext><mn id="S4.SS1.p2.2.m2.1.1.3" xref="S4.SS1.p2.2.m2.1.1.3.cmml">50</mn></msub><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S4.SS1.p2.2.m2.1b"><apply id="S4.SS1.p2.2.m2.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS1.p2.2.m2.1.1"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S4.SS1.p2.2.m2.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS1.p2.2.m2.1.1">subscript</csymbol><ci id="S4.SS1.p2.2.m2.1.1.2a.cmml" xref="S4.SS1.p2.2.m2.1.1.2"><mtext id="S4.SS1.p2.2.m2.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S4.SS1.p2.2.m2.1.1.2">AP</mtext></ci><cn type="integer" id="S4.SS1.p2.2.m2.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S4.SS1.p2.2.m2.1.1.3">50</cn></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S4.SS1.p2.2.m2.1c">\textrm{AP}_{50}</annotation></semantics></math> has a gain of more than 5% compared to the vanilla mean-teacher when semi-supervised learning is performed with density crops in the 10% setting.</p>

Using density crops increases the detection accuracy both in supervised and semi-supervised settings. Compared to the supervised settings, the AP of all-sized objects increases by more than 5% when semi-supervised learning is performed with density crops. The improvement over the vanilla mean-teacher is more than 3% in most settings. The APs of small, medium, and large objects with fully supervised training using 100% labeled data are 25.74, 42.93, and 41.44 respectively.

APs of small, medium, and large objects with 100% supervised data on the DOTA dataset are 15.66, 38.16, and 44.2 respectively. While for small objects, our method with 10% labeled data is 3% below the supervised upper bound, the gap is around 10% for medium and large objects. This implies the boost from the density-guided training is more concentrated on the small objects. All of these experiments confirm the impact of each component in our model as well. The performance gain with our density-guided semi-supervised detector over the supervised baseline is significant and consistent.</p>

<p id="S4.SS1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">We also produced a qualitative comparison of the detection results from our semi-supervised model with that of its supervised baseline. Figure <a href="#S4.F7" title="Figure 7 ‣ IV-A Comparison with Different Percentage of Labeled Data ‣ IV Experiments ‣ Density Crop-guided Semi-supervised Object Detection in Aerial Images" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">7</span></a> shows the comparison on the DOTA (top two rows) and VisDrone (bottom two rows) datasets. The supervised baseline is shown at the top and the semi-supervised results at the bottom among each pair of rows. We can see that many tiny objects are getting detected with our density-guided semi-supervised detector. In the case of VisDrone datasets, the baseline detector is missing most of the small objects at the farther end of the camera, whereas our method with zoom-in capability is discovering them. In the DOTA dataset, the missing happens at a much higher rate as the images are very high in pixel resolution. Especially objects like small cars are mostly missed by the baseline detector on the DOTA dataset. But our method shows impressive results in detecting them.</p>

<p id="S4.SS2.p1.3" class="ltx_p">As other density-based approaches for small object detection use an external module (and multi-stage training) for crop extraction, we cannot adapt them to the semi-supervised settings with mean-teacher. So, we choose the recently proposed scale-aware detection QueryDet <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib47" title="" class="ltx_ref">47</a>]</cite> as it also accelerates small object detection with a detector itself. In particular, they proposed sparse querying on the high-resolution feature maps to improve small object detection. This is implemented on the feature pyramids within a detector, so we can wrap the mean-teacher training on top of this method. We used the VisDrone dataset with 10% labels in this study. The result is shown in table <a href="#S4.T3" title="TABLE III ‣ IV-B Comparison with Other Semi-supervised Detectors ‣ IV Experiments ‣ Density Crop-guided Semi-supervised Object Detection in Aerial Images" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">III</span></a>.

The results in these tables ablate the components of the proposed method extensively. Furthermore, the change in performance on objects of different sizes with these components is illustrated in figures <a href="#S4.F5" title="Figure 5 ‣ IV-A Comparison with Different Percentage of Labeled Data ‣ IV Experiments ‣ Density Crop-guided Semi-supervised Object Detection in Aerial Images" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5</span></a> and <a href="#S4.F6" title="Figure 6 ‣ IV-A Comparison with Different Percentage of Labeled Data ‣ IV Experiments ‣ Density Crop-guided Semi-supervised Object Detection in Aerial Images" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">6</span></a>. The observations conclude that using density crops with the semi-supervised mean-teacher detector significantly improves the results over the basic supervised detector. As the impact of the components of the proposed method is verified with these experiments, we devote the ablation studies to consider other design choices and fine-grained analysis of the method’s performance. We used the VisDrone dataset in this study.</p>

<p id="S4.SS4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The inference with density crops can be performed in two ways; taking the crop prediction directly from the model or running the cluster labeling algorithm with output detections. While the crop predictions are fast for inference, we observed that running the cluster labeling algorithm on the detection output is slightly more accurate. So one can choose the inference procedure among the two based on the speed vs accuracy trade-off of the downstream application. In the results reported so far, we used crop predictions directly from the model. To compare the performance of both we performed inference in two ways and reported the performance in table <a href="#S4.T4" title="TABLE IV ‣ IV-D Inference ‣ IV Experiments ‣ Density Crop-guided Semi-supervised Object Detection in Aerial Images" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">IV</span></a>.

We can also see that crop-labeled inference is improving the AP of small objects significantly, but at the same time, the AP of medium and large objects is declining. As the dataset is dominated by small objects, we still observe an overall improvement in performance. We also reported the detection speed in Frames Per Second (FPS). The FPS is only reduced by 5 frames when the expensive crop-labeled inference is used.</p>

Inference time per image is also provided. Finding crops on unlabeled images is performed only after the pseudo labels on unlabeled images are converged. The augmentation then adds an additional set of crops to the training process. That is why the SS+C (L+U) setting is taking longer iterations. For inference, the difference when using crops is due to the second detection performed on the crops. Even though there is an effective increase in training and inference time, the improvement in detection performance is significant.</p>

Figure <a href="#S4.F8" title="Figure 8 ‣ IV-G Analysis of the Type of Errors ‣ IV Experiments ‣ Density Crop-guided Semi-supervised Object Detection in Aerial Images" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">8</span></a> shows the comparison results. With the addition of density crops on a supervised detector, we observe the localization error reduces. Other types of errors remain mostly the same. With semi-supervised training using the vanilla mean-teacher method, the classification error reduces. Using density crops with semi-supervised learning is reducing the localization error similar to the fully-supervised case and other errors remain the same mostly. Compared to fully supervised detectors, semi-supervised detectors reduce classification error, but they tend to miss objects too. This is probably due to the imbalance in object classes of this dataset such that dominant classes get more pseudo-labels on unlabeled images. This can result in rare class objects being missed on the unlabeled images.</p>

<div id="S5.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We proposed an efficient adaptation of the mean-teacher semi-supervised method to high-resolution aerial images for the detection of small objects. This is achieved by identifying the clusters of small objects from labeled and unlabeled images and processing them in higher resolution. For the labeled images, the original ground-truth is used for crop identification, whereas on unlabeled images the pseudo ground-truth labels from the mean-teacher detector are used. As crop identification is happening within the detector, it is now possible to wrap the mean-teacher training on top of it. The clusters identified are cropped and used to augment the training set. The training with augmented crops is producing more pseudo-labels than the vanilla mean-teacher. This translates to improved detection performance. The inference is performed on the original image and crops of clusters obtained on it to boost the small object detection. Empirical studies on the popular benchmark datasets reveal the superiority of our method over supervised training and vanilla mean-teacher training. We also find more boost in performance for density-based approaches than the scale-aware training with the mean-teacher method for small object detection.</p>
