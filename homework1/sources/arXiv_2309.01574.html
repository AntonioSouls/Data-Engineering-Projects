<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">Rising maintenance costs of ageing infrastructure necessitate innovative monitoring techniques. This paper presents a new approach for detecting axles, enabling real-time application of Bridge Weigh-In-Motion (BWIM) systems without dedicated axle detectors. The proposed Virtual Axle Detector with Enhanced Receptive Field (VADER) is independent of bridge type and sensor placement while only using raw acceleration data as input. By using raw data instead of spectograms as input, the receptive field can be enhanced without increasing the number of parameters. We also introduce a novel receptive field (RF) rule for an object-size driven design of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures. We were able to show, that the RF rule has the potential to bridge the gap between physical boundary conditions and deep learning model development. Based on the RF rule, our results suggest that models using raw data could achieve better performance than those using spectrograms, offering a compelling reason to consider raw data as input. The proposed VADER achieves to detect 99.9 % of axles with a spatial error of 4.13 cm using only acceleration measurements, while cutting computational and memory costs by 99 % compared to the state-of-the-art using spectograms.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">As infrastructure ages, novel methods are imperative for efficient monitoring. Precise knowledge of the actual stress and loads on infrastructure enables more accurate determination of remaining service life, identification of overloaded vehicles, and more efficient planning for new constructions. Measuring loads directly is very difficult in many cases. Instead, loads can be reconstructed via the structural response <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>. Based on this, Weigh-In-Motion (WIM) systems are used to reconstruct the axle loads of trains or cars. WIM systems have the advantage of being able to determine the axle loads in the regular traffic flow. Conventional WIM systems necessitate installation directly into roadways or tracks, often requiring traffic disruption. Conventional WIM systems are therefore expensive and hardly suitable for a nationwide investigation of axle loads. In contrast, Bridge WIM systems (BWIM) are positioned beneath bridge structures, facilitating reuse and repositioning for multiple BWIM measurements <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>. Thus, the installation of a BWIM system is less expensive and can be used for a multitude of time-limited investigations.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">For large-scale investigations of axle loads, BWIM systems are therefore hardly dispensable. However, effective utilisation of BWIM systems typically demands knowledge of the axle positions <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>. For this purpose, additional sensors currently need to be installed at specific locations (facing the roadway, on the cross girders, or near the supports) that depend on the bridge structure <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>. Only in the case of thin slab bridges can BWIM strain sensors be reliably used for axle detection <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Tan et al. [<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite> has proposed a BWIM system that works without axle detectors, but this system is dependent on strain measurements and only works for one vehicle at a time on the bridge. However, for a large scale application of BWIM measurements, a method for axle detection and localisation that is independent of bridge type, measured physical quantities and sensor position would be of great benefit, effectively reducing cost and risk. Therefore, our study aims at an axle detection method using existing sensors of arbitrary BWIM systems. To determine the axle positions, axles are usually detected at at least two locations. With the distance between the locations and the difference in time, the axle position can then be interpolated or extrapolated in time.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">The term Sound Event Detection (SED) is predominantly used in the literature for the detection of events in time series <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>, <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>, <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>, <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>. One of the tasks of SED is for example speech recognition. Here, events refer to words and audible sound is used as input. However, this methodology can also be applied to other vibration signals as input (such as accelerations in bridges) to find events like a train axle passing a bridge. For SED problems, time series are typically analysed in the form of 2D spectrograms using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>, <a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite> or, more recently, Transformers <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite>, despite the competitive performance of 1D CNNs <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite>. Consequently, research often concentrates on identifying the most suitable spectrogram type <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>, <a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite>. Notably, in conventional tasks like speech recognition and acoustic scene classification, log mel spectrograms dominate <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>, <a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>, <a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite>, despite some studies showing better or comparable outcomes using raw data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>, <a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>, <a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>, <a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite>. In the context of axle localisation, Continuous Wavelet Transformations (CWTs) have demonstrated suitability as features for axle detection <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>, <a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>, <a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>, <a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>]</cite>. Given that CWTs even compete well in speech recognition <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite> and log mel spectrograms were tailored for human auditory perception, CWTs were adopted in our earlier work for axle detection <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>]</cite>. However, it is unclear whether CWTs are actually necessary, whether raw measurement data is sufficient as model input, and how this affects the model’s performance.</p>

<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">In addition, there are only a few guidelines for the hyperparameters and architectures for the development of neural networks and these usually refer to empirical values <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">38</a>]</cite>. In order to adapt models for new problems faster and more reliably, we propose in this study a receptive field rule based on object sizes and validate it on the virtual axle detector. The object size in this case refers to the minimum natural frequency of a bridge, but the basic principle should also be transferable to other domains such as sound or images.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">In this study, we propose a novel approach that enables real-time detection and localisation of axles using arbitrarily placed sensors. For each sensor, the axles are localised at the nearest point of the tracks to the sensor (perpendicular to the direction of travel). The position can also be determined multi-dimensionally using several sensors, making the concept presented here relevant for car bridges as well. Consequently, BWIM systems can now conduct real-time axle detection without the need for additional sensors. The concept is validated on a single track railway bridge. This means that in this study there is only one train at a time on the bridge on a ballasted track. To make it transferable to car bridges, the axles were always considered individually and not as part of a vehicle. The proposed concept determines the longitudinal position of axles using sensors distributed longitudinally. A transversal distribution of additional sensors could therefore determine the position of the axles in two directions. Thus, the approach is theoretically also applicable for multi-lane car bridges. To validate our approach, we adapted the VAD model <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>]</cite> to handle raw measurement data and performed several tests on the dataset from <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Lorenzen et al.

<p id="S2.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The dataset from <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Lorenzen et al. [<a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">39</a>]</cite> was acquired on a single-span steel trough railway bridge situated on a long-distance traffic line in Germany (fig. <a href="#S2.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 2.1 Data Acquisition ‣ 2 Methodology ‣ Object Size-Driven Design of Convolutional Neural Networks: Virtual Axle Detection based on Raw Data" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>). This bridge is 18.4 meters long with a free span of 16.4 meters and a natural frequency of about 6.9 Hz for the first bending mode. The natural frequency is variable with a non-linear dependence on the load due to the ballast <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib40" title="" class="ltx_ref">40</a>]</cite>. Measurement data from ten seismic uniaxial accelerometers with a sampling rate of 600 Hz installed along the bridge are used as features.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Utilizing a supervised learning approach, our model requires labels as the ground truth from which to learn. For the creation of the labels, four rosette strain gauges directly installed on the rails (fig. <a href="#S2.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 2.1 Data Acquisition ‣ 2 Methodology ‣ Object Size-Driven Design of Convolutional Neural Networks: Virtual Axle Detection based on Raw Data" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>) were used to ensure that the accuracy of the assumed ground truth is sufficient to accurately evaluate the performance of the model. The rosette strain gauges were used to determine the axle positions and velocities of the passing trains. This was then used to determine the points in time at which the axles were closest to the individual acceleration sensors (perpendicular to the direction of travel). By using this as a label, the model is trained to use the acceleration sensors as a virtual light barrier that is triggered when a train axle is crossed <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>]</cite>. The label vector contains ones at the time points when a train axle is positioned above the respective sensor, and the rest are zeros (fig. <a href="#S2.F2" title="Figure 2 ‣ 2.1 Data Acquisition ‣ 2 Methodology ‣ Object Size-Driven Design of Convolutional Neural Networks: Virtual Axle Detection based on Raw Data" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>). Therefore, the sum of the label vector yields the number of axles of the corresponding train. The model then only receives the acceleration signals of a single sensor at a time and predicts the times at which an axle is located above this sensor. From a number of two acceleration sensors, the axle distances and velocities can thus also be determined. Due to the sampling rate, an inaccuracy of 6-38 cm is assumed for the label creation, depending on the train’s velocity and the sensor’s position. The dataset consist out of 3,745 train passages with one label vector per sensor.

<div id="S2.SS3.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The training and validation sets were implemented using a five-fold cross-validation approach with a holdout test set. Initially, one-sixth of the data was separated for the test set. The remaining data was divided into five folds. During training, a different fold was used as the validation set in each iteration, while the other four folds were used for training. Training concluded based on the validation set results, and the model was consistently tested on the same test set. This process allowed the model to be evaluated five times using the same data, providing a more accurate estimation of its generalization capability <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">38</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS3.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS3.p2.1" class="ltx_p">To further investigate the applicability of the proposed concept, the dataset was split into training and testing based on the number of train axles in two different ways. In the first split, the model is intended to function as a surrogate for a malfunctioning axle detector. For this purpose, the data set was split for all folds and the test set in a stratified fashion (fig. <a href="#S2.F3.sf1" title="In Figure 3 ‣ 2.3 Data Split ‣ 2 Methodology ‣ Object Size-Driven Design of Convolutional Neural Networks: Virtual Axle Detection based on Raw Data" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3(a)</span></a>), resulting in 3,110 passages with 112,038 individual axles for training and 623 passages with 22,472 individual axles for testing.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS3.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS3.p3.1" class="ltx_p">In the second split, the model was provided only with axle positions from trains of a single type. This simulates a scenario in which only one train type is equipped with a differential global positioning system (DGPS), but the axles of all other train types still need to be recognized. This allows the robustness of the method and the overfitting of the model to be examined. Since the exact construction series of the trains for determining the train types are not known, the train length in axles was used as a simplified criterion instead. Trains with the most frequent axle count were used for the five-fold cross-validation sets, while all other train lengths were included in the test set (fig. <a href="#S2.F3.sf2" title="In Figure 3 ‣ 2.3 Data Split ‣ 2 Methodology ‣ Object Size-Driven Design of Convolutional Neural Networks: Virtual Axle Detection based on Raw Data" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3(b)</span></a>). This results in 1,916 passages with 61,312 individual axles for training and 1,817 passages with 73,198 individual axles for testing.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS3.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS3.p4.1" class="ltx_p">With the stratified splits, training is done with about 5/6 of the data and testing with 1/6 of the data, whereas the splits in the DGPS set for training and testing are about the same size. Thus, in the case of DGPS splits, in addition to having significantly less data available for training, these data are also not representative of the test data and therefore not for all trains. It should be noted that with non-representative data sets, inadequate results are usually to be expected <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">38</a>]</cite>. Thus, the DPGS splits are suitable for testing the models under particularly difficult conditions.</p>

<div id="S2.SS4.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The VADER model is implemented as a fully convolutional neural network (FCN) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib42" title="" class="ltx_ref">42</a>]</cite> to handle inputs of arbitrary lengths. This property is particularly advantageous for the detection of train axles, as the crossing time varies significantly based on the train’s speed and the number of axles.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS4.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS4.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The U-Net concept <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib43" title="" class="ltx_ref">43</a>]</cite> was chosen for the model architecture, originally developed for semantic segmentation of images, but also adaptable for segmenting time series data. The fundamental concept of the U-Net architecture is the encoder and decoder path. Even though new architectures have been developed, the U-Net architecture is still frequently used as backbone <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib44" title="" class="ltx_ref">44</a>, <a href="#bib.bib45" title="" class="ltx_ref">45</a>, <a href="#bib.bib46" title="" class="ltx_ref">46</a>]</cite>. In order to investigate the effects of the hyperparameters kernel size, max pooling size and pooling steps, no other model architectures are considered in this study. In the encoder path, the resolution is progressively reduced and information is compressed, while in the decoder path, the resolution is increased back to the original dimensions (fig. <a href="#S2.F4.sf1" title="In Figure 4 ‣ 2.4 Model Definition ‣ 2 Methodology ‣ Object Size-Driven Design of Convolutional Neural Networks: Virtual Axle Detection based on Raw Data" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4(a)</span></a>). The encoder path aims to capture details at various resolutions, while the decoder path integrates these details into the appropriate context. The intermediate results from the encoder and decoder paths at the same resolution are combined through skip connections.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS4.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS4.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Our implementation of the U-Net comprises of a well established combination <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">38</a>]</cite> of convolution blocks (CBs), residual blocks (RBs) originally proposed by <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">He et al. [<a href="#bib.bib47" title="" class="ltx_ref">47</a>]</cite>, max pooling layers, concatenate layers, and transposed convolution layers (fig. <a href="#S2.F4" title="Figure 4 ‣ 2.4 Model Definition ‣ 2 Methodology ‣ Object Size-Driven Design of Convolutional Neural Networks: Virtual Axle Detection based on Raw Data" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a>). A CB always consists of a convolution layer with Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) activation and a group normalisation layer <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib48" title="" class="ltx_ref">48</a>]</cite>. The first group normalisation layer has a single group (making it nearly identical to Layer Normalisation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib48" title="" class="ltx_ref">48</a>]</cite>) and remaining group norm layers have 16 channels per group. As a result, the measurement data is first normalised individually (as 1 channel per sensor) in the first group normalisation layer and the remaining CNN feature maps are normalised with the optimum group size according to <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Wu and He [<a href="#bib.bib48" title="" class="ltx_ref">48</a>]</cite>. Group normalisation was shown to be less sensitive to other hyperparameters like batch size and was therefore chosen to effectively reduce the hyperparameter space. The RBs were implemented similarly to the 50-layer or larger variants of the ResNet <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib47" title="" class="ltx_ref">47</a>]</cite>. The final layer in both models is a convolution layer with only one filter and sigmoid activation.</p>

As the kernel size is larger, the pooling size can also be increased. In order to determine the optimal pooling size, kernel size and amount of pooling steps we propose the receptive field (RF) rule: To achieve good results with a CNN, the largest effective receptive field must be at least as large as the largest object of interest. The effective receptive field refers to the number of samples that the kernel could see at the original resolution/sampling rate. After a max pooling layer of size two, the effective receptive field would therefore double with the same kernel size. In our case, the RF rule can be used to calculate the required size of the largest receptive field to capture the lowest frequency of interest:</p>

There are no objects with frequencies lower than 1 Hz that the model should be able to detect. An RF that can capture frequencies of 1 Hz already allows to capture several bridge oscillation periods in one RF. Beyond that, the risk increases that entire trains and thus axle configurations are learned by the model. This would therefore increase the probability of overfitting and reduce the generalisation capability.</p>

Generally using raw data instead of CWTs is a significant reduction in computation time and memory requirements. For the six CWTs with 16 scales each as proposed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Lorenzen et al. [<a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>]</cite>, a 12-second traversal requires 1.4 seconds and about 5.7 MB of memory just for the transformation. In contrast, our approach takes only 0.022 seconds from raw data to prediction with about 61.1 KB memory usage. Therefore, when using raw data, inference becomes at least 65 times faster compared to using spectograms, while using only about 1 % of the memory for the input. In our case the axle detection for a train with 64 axles using 10 acceleration sensors would take <math id="S3.p1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="1.4~{}\mathrm{s}\times 10=140~{}\mathrm{s}" display="inline"><semantics id="S3.p1.1.m1.1a"><mrow id="S3.p1.1.m1.1.1" xref="S3.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml"><mrow id="S3.p1.1.m1.1.1.2" xref="S3.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml"><mrow id="S3.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.2" xref="S3.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.2.cmml"><mn id="S3.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.2.2" xref="S3.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.2.2.cmml">1.4</mn><mo lspace="0.330em" rspace="0em" id="S3.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.2.1" xref="S3.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.2.1.cmml">​</mo><mi mathvariant="normal" id="S3.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.2.3" xref="S3.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.2.3.cmml">s</mi></mrow><mo lspace="0.222em" rspace="0.222em" id="S3.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.1" xref="S3.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.1.cmml">×</mo><mn id="S3.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.3" xref="S3.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.3.cmml">10</mn></mrow><mo id="S3.p1.1.m1.1.1.1" xref="S3.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml">=</mo><mrow id="S3.p1.1.m1.1.1.3" xref="S3.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml"><mn id="S3.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.2" xref="S3.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.2.cmml">140</mn><mo lspace="0.330em" rspace="0em" id="S3.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.1" xref="S3.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.1.cmml">​</mo><mi mathvariant="normal" id="S3.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.3" xref="S3.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.3.cmml">s</mi></mrow></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S3.p1.1.m1.1b"><apply id="S3.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.p1.1.m1.1.1"><eq id="S3.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.p1.1.m1.1.1.1"></eq><apply id="S3.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S3.p1.1.m1.1.1.2"><times id="S3.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.1.cmml" xref="S3.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.1"></times><apply id="S3.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.2.cmml" xref="S3.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.2"><times id="S3.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.2.1.cmml" xref="S3.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.2.1"></times><cn type="float" id="S3.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.2.2.cmml" xref="S3.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.2.2">1.4</cn><ci id="S3.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.2.3.cmml" xref="S3.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.2.3">s</ci></apply><cn type="integer" id="S3.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.3.cmml" xref="S3.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.3">10</cn></apply><apply id="S3.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S3.p1.1.m1.1.1.3"><times id="S3.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.1.cmml" xref="S3.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.1"></times><cn type="integer" id="S3.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.2.cmml" xref="S3.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.2">140</cn><ci id="S3.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.3.cmml" xref="S3.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.3">s</ci></apply></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S3.p1.1.m1.1c">1.4~{}\mathrm{s}\times 10=140~{}\mathrm{s}</annotation></semantics></math> with VADERspec and <math id="S3.p1.2.m2.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="0.022~{}\mathrm{s}\times 10=0.22~{}\mathrm{s}" display="inline"><semantics id="S3.p1.2.m2.1a"><mrow id="S3.p1.2.m2.1.1" xref="S3.p1.2.m2.1.1.cmml"><mrow id="S3.p1.2.m2.1.1.2" xref="S3.p1.2.m2.1.1.2.cmml"><mrow id="S3.p1.2.m2.1.1.2.2" xref="S3.p1.2.m2.1.1.2.2.cmml"><mn id="S3.p1.2.m2.1.1.2.2.2" xref="S3.p1.2.m2.1.1.2.2.2.cmml">0.022</mn><mo lspace="0.330em" rspace="0em" id="S3.p1.2.m2.1.1.2.2.1" xref="S3.p1.2.m2.1.1.2.2.1.cmml">​</mo><mi mathvariant="normal" id="S3.p1.2.m2.1.1.2.2.3" xref="S3.p1.2.m2.1.1.2.2.3.cmml">s</mi></mrow><mo lspace="0.222em" rspace="0.222em" id="S3.p1.2.m2.1.1.2.1" xref="S3.p1.2.m2.1.1.2.1.cmml">×</mo><mn id="S3.p1.2.m2.1.1.2.3" xref="S3.p1.2.m2.1.1.2.3.cmml">10</mn></mrow><mo id="S3.p1.2.m2.1.1.1" xref="S3.p1.2.m2.1.1.1.cmml">=</mo><mrow id="S3.p1.2.m2.1.1.3" xref="S3.p1.2.m2.1.1.3.cmml"><mn id="S3.p1.2.m2.1.1.3.2" xref="S3.p1.2.m2.1.1.3.2.cmml">0.22</mn><mo lspace="0.330em" rspace="0em" id="S3.p1.2.m2.1.1.3.1" xref="S3.p1.2.m2.1.1.3.1.cmml">​</mo><mi mathvariant="normal" id="S3.p1.2.m2.1.1.3.3" xref="S3.p1.2.m2.1.1.3.3.cmml">s</mi></mrow></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S3.p1.2.m2.1b"><apply id="S3.p1.2.m2.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.p1.2.m2.1.1"><eq id="S3.p1.2.m2.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.p1.2.m2.1.1.1"></eq><apply id="S3.p1.2.m2.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S3.p1.2.m2.1.1.2"><times id="S3.p1.2.m2.1.1.2.1.cmml" xref="S3.p1.2.m2.1.1.2.1"></times><apply id="S3.p1.2.m2.1.1.2.2.cmml" xref="S3.p1.2.m2.1.1.2.2"><times id="S3.p1.2.m2.1.1.2.2.1.cmml" xref="S3.p1.2.m2.1.1.2.2.1"></times><cn type="float" id="S3.p1.2.m2.1.1.2.2.2.cmml" xref="S3.p1.2.m2.1.1.2.2.2">0.022</cn><ci id="S3.p1.2.m2.1.1.2.2.3.cmml" xref="S3.p1.2.m2.1.1.2.2.3">s</ci></apply><cn type="integer" id="S3.p1.2.m2.1.1.2.3.cmml" xref="S3.p1.2.m2.1.1.2.3">10</cn></apply><apply id="S3.p1.2.m2.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S3.p1.2.m2.1.1.3"><times id="S3.p1.2.m2.1.1.3.1.cmml" xref="S3.p1.2.m2.1.1.3.1"></times><cn type="float" id="S3.p1.2.m2.1.1.3.2.cmml" xref="S3.p1.2.m2.1.1.3.2">0.22</cn><ci id="S3.p1.2.m2.1.1.3.3.cmml" xref="S3.p1.2.m2.1.1.3.3">s</ci></apply></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S3.p1.2.m2.1c">0.022~{}\mathrm{s}\times 10=0.22~{}\mathrm{s}</annotation></semantics></math> with VADERraw. Even for more realistic scenarios with, e.g., three sensors VADERspec would take almost minutes while VADERraw takes under a second to detect the axles. This does not even include the other additional tracks and reduced computing power for on-site evaluation. With trains being a few minutes apart, the higher efficiency of VADERraw is essential for real-world application.</p>

The max pooling size can be regarded as an upsampling factor in this context. With a max pooling size of three, the signal must therefore be increased to three times its length. This is achieved in this case by inserting two zeros between all input values. The signal is then filtered with the kernel. In this case, the kernel only ever stretches over one of the input values and two zeros. This means that the transposed convolution layer cannot interpolate between the input values. However, as soon as the kernel size is larger than the max pooling size, the kernel can always capture two values and therefore interpolate as expected.

This is to ensure that the hyperparameters deliver good results in all metrics and scenarios. A closer look at the results shows that the best results are achieved with 4 pooling steps (fig. <a href="#S3.F7.sf1" title="In Figure 7 ‣ 3 Results and Discussion ‣ Object Size-Driven Design of Convolutional Neural Networks: Virtual Axle Detection based on Raw Data" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">7(a)</span></a>). This could be due to the fact that this increases the complexity of the model, as the data is additionally filtered twice (once in the encoder path and once in the decoder path) with each pooling step. The best results are achieved with a max pooling size of 3 (fig. <a href="#S3.F7.sf2" title="In Figure 7 ‣ 3 Results and Discussion ‣ Object Size-Driven Design of Convolutional Neural Networks: Virtual Axle Detection based on Raw Data" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">7(b)</span></a>). This could be because it allows a larger receptive field than a max pooling size of 2, but does not lose as much information as max pooling sizes of 4 or 5. The impact of the kernel size is the most ambiguous (fig. <a href="#S3.F7.sf3" title="In Figure 7 ‣ 3 Results and Discussion ‣ Object Size-Driven Design of Convolutional Neural Networks: Virtual Axle Detection based on Raw Data" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">7(c)</span></a>).

<p id="S3.p5.1" class="ltx_p">For the final evaluation, the optimal hyperparameter combination with four pooling steps, max pooling size of three and a kernel size of nine, resulting in a receptive field size of 729 samples, is selected as the first VADERraw model. In order to test the hypothesis that the model must be able to map a maximum of 5 Hz with a load-dependent natural frequency of the bridge, the combination was selected that comes closest to this by changing only a single hyperparameter. The second VADERraw model thus differs only in the max pooling size with a value of two instead of three, yielding a receptive field size of 243 samples. From here on, the max pooling size is appended to the model name for traceability, so that the first model is called <span id="S3.p5.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">VADERraw3</span> and the second model <span id="S3.p5.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">VADERraw2</span>.</p>

No clear differences are recognisable for the loss. VADERspec performs worse than the VADERraw models in all cases.

Using these parameters, the models were then evaluated on the previously unseen test set. This procedure was repeated for all folds, splits (stratified and DGPS) and thresholds (200 cm and 37 cm) for each of the three models (VADERspec, VADERraw2 and VADERraw3). The VADERraw models achieve significantly higher accuracy for both threshold values (200 cm and 37 cm) and both splits (stratified and DGPS) (fig. <a href="#S3.F9.sf1" title="In Figure 9 ‣ 3 Results and Discussion ‣ Object Size-Driven Design of Convolutional Neural Networks: Virtual Axle Detection based on Raw Data" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">9(a)</span></a>, <a href="#S3.F9.sf2" title="In Figure 9 ‣ 3 Results and Discussion ‣ Object Size-Driven Design of Convolutional Neural Networks: Virtual Axle Detection based on Raw Data" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">9(b)</span></a>). In general, it can be observed that the accuracy of all models is considerably better for the stratified split compared to the DGPS split. The variance of the results is comparable for all models and as expected, the variance is generally higher for the more difficult DGPS scenario. VADERraw2 achieves the best results in all metrics for the DGPS splits while VADERraw3 achieves the best results for the stratified splits (tab. <a href="#S3.T2" title="Table 2 ‣ 3 Results and Discussion ‣ Object Size-Driven Design of Convolutional Neural Networks: Virtual Axle Detection based on Raw Data" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>). Since VADERraw3 has a significantly larger receptive field, it could be that the model learns entire train axle configurations, while VADERraw2 only learns individual axles or bogies. In this case, this would be advantageous for a representative data set (stratified splits), while it would increase the overfitting on the training data for non-representative data (DGPS splits). Generally VADERraw3 and VADERraw2 achieve similar results and only VADERspec performs significantly worse.</p>

For the DGPS splits, the results are more scattered for all senors, but there are still large differences, especially in the median. it is also noticeable that VADERspec consistently performs worst and the VADERraw models are close to each other. For sensor R3, VADERraw3 almost always performs better than VADERraw2, but due to the high dispersion of the results, this is not necessarily due to the model.

<span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_section">4 </span>Conclusion</h2>

<div id="S4.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We have demonstrated that an CNN with an adequate receptive field can achieve better results using raw data compared to using a spectrogram as input. This could be due to the loss of information when transforming into spectograms, whereas an CNN can directly learn to filter the data comparable to it when necessary. In order to achieve comparable or better results with raw data instead of spectograms, we propose the RF rule to calculate the required size of the largest receptive field of a model (eq. <a href="#S2.E1" title="In 2.4 Model Definition ‣ 2 Methodology ‣ Object Size-Driven Design of Convolutional Neural Networks: Virtual Axle Detection based on Raw Data" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>). Based on our results we were able to show the potential of raw data as input considering the RF rule.</p>
</div>
<div id="S4.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Furthermore, we demonstrated that acceleration data is suitable for axle detection and localisation. It is particularly noteworthy that even when training with only one type of train and thus a non-representative training set, we were able to achieve very good results on other train types, demonstrating that the model generalises exceptionally well. In this case, VADER was trained solely on trains with 32 axles but could still detect 97.5 % of the axles of all other train types, with an average spatial error of 14.5 cm. Trained on a representative training set, VADER was able to detect 99.9 % of the axles with an error of just 3.69 cm. In addition to improved accuracy, VADER using raw data allows for an inference that is 65 times faster while using only 1 % of the memory. This makes the use of virtual axle detectors in real time and using edge computing possible for the first time.</p>
</div>
<div id="S4.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.p3.1" class="ltx_p">It is evident that there is significant potential yet to be unlocked. The VADER model evaluates the signals of the acceleration sensors individually. A joint evaluation of the signals could further increase the accuracy. Another approach could be a combination of raw input data, FCN-based spectrogram-like data transformation, and transformer-based classification. This way, the FCN could learn how to optimally transform the data, while the transformer model would be utilised to identify even more complex correlations and relationships.</p>
