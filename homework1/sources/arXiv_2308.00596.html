<p id="id13.id1" class="ltx_p">Autonomous driving perception tasks rely heavily on cameras as the primary sensor for Object Detection, Semantic Segmentation, Instance Segmentation, and Object Tracking. However, RGB images captured by cameras lack depth information, which poses a significant challenge in 3D detection tasks. To supplement this missing data, mapping sensors such as LIDAR and RADAR are used for accurate 3D Object Detection. Despite their significant accuracy, the multi-sensor models are expensive and require a high computational demand. In contrast, Monocular 3D Object Detection models are becoming increasingly popular, offering a faster, cheaper, and easier-to-implement solution for 3D detections. This paper introduces a different Multi-Tasking Learning approach called MonoNext that utilizes a spatial grid to map objects in the scene. MonoNext employs a straightforward approach based on the ConvNext network and requires only 3D bounding box annotated data. In our experiments with the KITTI dataset, MonoNext achieved high precision and competitive performance comparable with state-of-the-art approaches. Furthermore, by adding more training data, MonoNext surpassed itself and achieved higher accuracies. The code will be released at <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/marcelopederiva/MonoNext" title="" class="ltx_ref ltx_url ltx_font_typewriter">https://github.com/marcelopederiva/MonoNext</a>.</p>

<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Object detection is a fundamental task in the field of Computer Vision. The ability to recognize and locate objects in both two and three dimensions plays a critical role in various areas, including robotic vision, safety applications, and autonomous driving.</p>

<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Object detection based on images has experienced significant advancements over the years, attracting the attention of research centers, industries, and universities. While 2D object detection achieves high accuracy in real time, accurately estimating the three-dimensional characteristics of objects without deep information remains a challenging task.</p>

<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Currently, state-of-the-art 3D Object Detection methods depend on the use of multiple sensors to estimate the characteristics of objects in a scene. By combining data from sensors that map the environment and cameras, these methods can achieve up to 80% accuracy in detecting objects, as demonstrated by the KITTI benchmark <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. However, sensors that provide this environment mapping, such as LIDARs, are expensive and computationally demanding. As a result, there is a growing interest in developing 3D detection models that rely solely on cameras in order to reduce cost and computational complexity.</p>

<div id="S2.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">2D Object Detection is a Computer Vision task that involves locating and classifying objects within an image. There are two types of methods used for this task: two-stage and single-stage detectors. Two-stage detectors use a first step to find proposed regions and a second step to identify and classify objects in these regions, providing high accuracy but slower performance. Single-stage detectors use a straightforward approach for identifying objects, providing faster detections and real-time predictions.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The Region-based Convolutional Neural Network (R-CNN) pioneered the two-stage object detection approach by utilizing CNNs to improve object detection accuracy <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>. R-CNN uses a CNN, such as AlexNet <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>, to propose regions of interest, which are then passed by another network to predict objects. The model featured the best accuracy at the time and inspired the development of derived versions. Fast R-CNN and Faster R-CNN are variations of R-CNN that further improved object detection performance by introducing better region proposal methods and approaches to detect faster <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>. Furthermore, different two-stage methods emerged, presenting competitive performances. SPP-Net <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite> proposes a Spatial Pyramid Pooling layer to handle variable input sizes and aspect ratios, reducing computational demands, and achieving comparable accuracy to R-CNN with faster detection times. The Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) concatenates feature maps from different scales to enhancing the detection of small objects and maintain accuracy at different scales <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>.</p>

<p id="S2.SS1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">One-stage models have become increasingly popular due to their fast response time and straightforward approach. One of the most influential one-stage models is the Single Shot Multibox Detector (SSD) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>. The SSD uses a cascading approach to detect objects based on different layers’ dimensions in the Convolutional Network, achieving the same performance as two-stage models while maintaining real-time behavior.</p>

The YOLO model uses a unique and straightforward architecture that predicts a classification grid based on the input image. Although the model initially did not have the best accuracy, it was very light and reached high detection speeds. Over the years, new versions of YOLO have emerged with changes in architecture and training to achieve high accuracy and low response times <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>.</p>

<p id="S2.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Unlike 2D detections, 3D object detection models are tasked with recognizing objects in a three-dimensional space, which requires accurate 3D localization, dimension, and angle rotation of the object. However, predicting these characteristics using only one image (monocular detection) and without depth information is challenging.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS2.p2" class="ltx_para">

Some methods use the object’s position information in the image to detect 2D objects and then refine 3D estimates on it <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>. The GS3D utilizes 2D detection models to project a 3D guidance and then refines the projection for the final detection of objects <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite>. In contrast, MonoCon uses 2D detection data but proposes a direct approach to 3D estimation, where 2D information is only used to converge the loss error <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite>. Mono3D uses 2D data along with class semantic and instance semantic information to refine the model <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite>.</p>

The model uses deep-aware convolution techniques to learn spatial information. On the other hand, the Orthographic Feature Transform predicts a feature grid from the output of a front-end ResNet-18 to map the objects in the scene in a voxel-based representation. This grid projection is then refined by another network that predicts the object’s characteristics in each grid <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite>.</p>

MobileNetV2 has demonstrated excellent performance while being one of the lightest feature extractors. This made it one of the best candidates to serve as the backbone of our model.

The increase in contrast and horizontal flip was adopted as the data augmentation. Our model was trained in a GPU: RTX2080ti and CPU: intel i7 9700KF with batch size 8, achieving the best results with around 200 epochs. The AdamW optimizer was used with an initial learning rate of 1e-4 and weight decay of 1e-6. For performance comparison, the model was trained to recognize only one class (vehicles) around [-55/55m, 0/15m, 0/85m]. However, our model is flexible to detect multiple classes and in different environments.</p>

<p id="S4.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In the KITTI dataset, there are more Easy detections shown in the images. In this case, using 50% of the dataset for training contributes to achieving great performance in this category and does not generalize the model enough for other detections (Moderate, Hard). Conversely, with 80% of the dataset + data augmentation, our model achieves high performance in 3D detection based on monocular models. The model presents a proper generalization of each detection category and a higher performance in hard detections. The table shows that the model still has the performance to achieve better results with more training data.</p>

Average Recognition represents vehicles recognized in the scene with an IoU&gt;0.1. Considering correct detections with IoU&gt;0.5, the model correctly detects 43% of full visible vehicles. Furthermore, evaluating the recognition of objects, MonoNext reaches an accuracy of  72% in its detections.</p>

Despite using a small dataset of 3712 images (50%), MonoNext outperforms several images-only methods. We achieved competitive performance in Easy detections, with a 4.48% increase in accuracy compared to MonoPair. While our model did not reach the same performance as GUPNet in all categories, it’s important to note that GUPNet uses pre-trained weights, which helps in achieving higher performance even with a small dataset.</p>

<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In conclusion, we have presented a novel model for Monocular 3D Object Detection called MonoNext, which uses a ConvNext-based architecture mixed with the MobineNetV2 to develop a lightweight approach for predicting multi-tasks for 3D detections. Our experiments on the KITTI benchmark have shown that the performance of our model is highly dependent on the number of training images. Nevertheless, our method presents competitive performance against state-of-the-art models when tested on the validation set. Moreover, by increasing the training set size, our model outperforms the current models. Although we have only evaluated our model’s performance in vehicle detection, it can be easily implemented for different objects in diverse environments. Additionally, the MonoNext model is flexible and capable of detecting multiple objects in the same scene. Overall, this work presents a promising approach for Monocular 3D Object Detection that can be further improved by incorporating additional training data and techniques.</p>
