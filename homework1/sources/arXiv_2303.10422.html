<p id="id3.id1" class="ltx_p">Conventional training of deep neural networks requires a large number of the annotated image which is a laborious and time-consuming task, particularly for rare objects. Few-shot object detection (FSOD) methods offer a remedy by realizing robust object detection using only a few training samples per class. An unexplored challenge for FSOD is that instances from unlabeled novel classes that do not belong to the fixed set of training classes appear in the background. These objects behave similarly to label noise, leading to FSOD performance degradation. We develop a semi-supervised algorithm to detect and then utilize these unlabeled novel objects as positive samples during training to improve FSOD performance. Specifically, we propose a hierarchical ternary classification region proposal network (HTRPN) to localize the potential unlabeled novel objects and assign them new objectness labels. Our improved hierarchical sampling strategy for the region proposal network (RPN) also boosts the perception ability of the object detection model for large objects. Our experimental results indicate that our method is effective and outperforms the existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) FSOD methods. <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/zshanggu/HTRPN" title="" class="ltx_ref ltx_url ltx_font_typewriter">https://github.com/zshanggu/HTRPN</a></p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The adoption of deep neural network architectures in object detection has led to a significant method in determining the location and the category of objects of interest in an image. In the presence of abundant training data, object detection models based on the region-based convolution neural networks (R-CNN) architecture reach high accuracy on most object detection tasks. However, preparing large-scale annotated training data can be a challenging task in some applications, e.g., miscellaneous disease analysis and industrial defect detection. In the presence of insufficient training data, these models easily overfit and fail to generalize well. In contrast, humans are able a novel object class very fast based on a few samples. As a result, it is extremely desirable to develop models that can learn object classes using only a few samples, known as few-shot object detection (FSOD).</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Current FSOD methods are based on pre-training a suitable model on a set of base classes with abundant training data and then fine-tuning the model on both the base classes and the novel classes for which only a few samples are accessible (see Figure <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ Identification of Novel Classes for Improving Few-Shot Object Detection" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>). The primary approach in FSOD is to benefit from ideas in transfer learning or meta-learning to learn novel classes through the knowledge obtained during the pre-training stage while maintaining good performance in base classes. Despite recent advances in FSOD, current SOTA methods are still far from getting favorable results on novel classes similar to the base classes. Potential reasons for this performance gap include the confusion between visually similar categories, incorrect annotations (label noise), the existence of unseen novel objects during training, etc. Recent FSOD methods have focused on addressing these challenges for improved FSOD performance.</p>

<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">We study the phenomenon that unlabeled novel object classes that do not belong to either of the base or the labeled novel classes can appear in the training data. For example, we see in Figure. <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ Identification of Novel Classes for Improving Few-Shot Object Detection" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a> that among base-class training samples, there are a number of objects that remain unlabeled, such as the cow in the image. These unlabeled objects can potentially belong to unseen novel classes. Our experiments demonstrate that this phenomenon exists in PASCAL VOC <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite> and COCO <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite> datasets.This phenomenon leads to the objectness inconsistency for the model when recognizing the novel objects: for the novel class, objects are treated as background if their annotations are missing, but they are treated as foreground where they are labeled. Such nonconformity of foreground and background confuses the model when training the objectness and make the model hard to converge and degrades detection accuracy.
</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">To tackle the above challenge, we develop a semi-supervised learning method to utilize the potential novel objects that appear during training to improve the ability of the model to recognize novel classes. We first demonstrate the possibility of detecting these unlabeled objects. Our experiment indicates that some unlabeled class objects are likely to be recognized if they are similar to the training base and novel classes. We collect the unlabeled novel objects from the background proposals by determining whether they are predicted as known classes, and then we give these proposals an extra objectness label in the region proposal network (RPN) so that the model could learn them. We also analyze the defect of the standard RPN in detecting objects of different sizes during training and propose a more balanced RPN sampling method so that objects are treated equally in all scales. We provide extensive experimental results to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on the PASCAL VOC and COCO datasets.

<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We assume that there are three classes: base classes, seen novel classes, and unseen novel classes. The base and the seen novel classes form the training dataset. For base classes, we have sufficient data but for seen novel classes, we have a few samples per class. Most works in FSOD only consider these classes. The unseen novel classes are not included in the training data but emerge as novel classes in the background.</p>

Typical object detection networks are usually either two-stage or one-stage. For two-stage object detection networks, such as R-CNN  <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>, R-FCN  <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>, Fast-RCNN  <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>, and Faster-RCNN  <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite>, the model first applies fixed anchors in the region proposal network (RPN) to determine if a proposal box contains an object. The selected proposals then are sent to the region of interest (RoI) pooling layer to get an instance-level classification and bounding boxes. One-stage object detection networks such as SSD  <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>, YOLO series  <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>, <a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite>, and Overfeat  <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite>, estimate the category and the location of an object directly from the backbone network without RPN. Two-stage object detection networks have higher detecting accuracy than one-stage schemes but lower inference speed  <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>.

In an object detection problem, the set of the base and the seen novel classes are assumed to be a closed set. However, there may be potential novel unseen objects in the training data that do not belong to the initial set of classes. These objects naturally are classified as one of seen classes and hence, there has been an interest to mitigate the adverse effects of these objects. Semi-supervised object detection network is a potential solution for this problem which utilizes the challenging samples  <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>, <a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>, <a href="#bib.bib41" title="" class="ltx_ref">41</a>]</cite>. Kaul et al.  <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite> build a class-specific self-supervised label verification model to identify candidates of unlabeled (unseen) objects and give them pseudo-annotations. The model is then retrained with these pseudo-annotated samples to improve the object-detecting accuracy. However, this method requires two rounds of training and requires extra effort to adapt to other categories. Li et al.  <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite> propose a distractor utilization loss by giving the distractor proposals a pseudo-label during fine-tuning. This method is used only in the fine-tuning stage and hence, the objectness inconsistency from the pre-training stage is not addressed. Inspired by these shortcomings, we propose utilizing the unlabeled potential objects that belong to the unseen classes to reduce the negative effect of novel objects.</p>

We then investigate the relationship between the number of anchors and the size of objects in each feature layer and provide a more effective sampling method for object detection. Finally, we describe our proposed pipeline to pick up objects from unseen classes with high confidence and then explain how we can modify their objectness loss to reduce their adverse effect.</p>

Therefore, the potential unlabeled objects from unseen novel classes are suppressed and hard to be identified as true objects. However, to correct the objectness of these potential objects, the first step is how to find them. We have observed the fact that the network often has clear attention to the potential objects in the RPN layer. As an example, we have used Grad-CAM visualization of the feature map of the RPN layer on some representative training images, as shown in Figure. <a href="#S2.F2" title="Figure 2 ‣ 2 Related works ‣ Identification of Novel Classes for Improving Few-Shot Object Detection" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>.

We hypothesize that this ability is because of the feature similarity between the features of some novel unseen classes and the base classes. As a result, the model would predict a novel unseen class object as a base class based on its resemblance. In other words, the novel objects contained by the negative anchors could probably have a relatively high classification score towards a base class that resembles them the most.

Appendix), the proposal ④ could be correctly included. Such a scheme significantly increases the possibility to dig up the true object as much as possible. As a result, the anchors that contain potential novel unseen class objects are well distinguished from the coarse negative anchors. The ternary RPN will let the model maintain its sensitivity to identify new objects from classes that have never been seen before. In practice, not all potential objects that exist in training datasets are going to be singled out during training and only a subset of them could be found. However, these identified novel unseen class objects still can alleviate the confusion of the model during few-shot learning due to their dissimilarity to the seen classes.</p>

The features of proposals are encoded as a default 128-dimension feature vector, and then the cosine similarity scores are measured between every two proposals. In this way, the HTRPN would give a higher objectness score.</p>

<div id="S6.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We improved the quality FSOD using R-CNN-based architecture via studying the phenomenon of objectness inconsistency due to the potential unlabeled novel objects that belong to unseen classes. By a balance anchor sampling strategy, we enhance the possibility of identifying anchors that may contain objects from unseen classes. In addition, we proposed HTRPN which leads to the recognition ability of potential novel objects and further enhances the objectness consistency. Our method mitigates model confusion about the novel classes and achieves SOTA performance on standard datasets. Future works include extensions to identify novel unseen classes in a zero-shot learning setting.</p>

However, when transferring to novel classes, the pre-trained model tends to predict some labeled novel objects as potential novel objects and the beginning of the fine-tuning stage, which could be considered as the inertia of the pre-trained model, therefore, the number of potential anchors is relatively high in the first several iterations of training. This also supports our theory that all true/potential positive ternary objectness of anchors should be presented by the combination of <math id="A2.p1.3.m3.1" class="ltx_Math"

As we are applying contrastive learning for RPN and RoI pooling, and the feature space of the pre-training and fine-tuning samples are totally different, the weights of these contrastive learning modules are not transferable from the pre-trained model to the fine-tuning tasks. Therefore, we remove the weights from the pre-trained model for fine-tuning training. The weights from the Resnet backbone and RoI pooling are unfrozen during fine-tuning.</p>
