<h6 class="ltx_title ltx_title_abstract">Abstract</h6>
<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">Recent works have demonstrated the importance of object completion in 3D Perception from Lidar signal. Several methods have been proposed in which modules were used to densify the point clouds produced by laser scanners, leading to better recall and more accurate results. Pursuing in that direction, we present, in this work, a counter-intuitive perspective: the widely-used full-shape completion approach actually lead to a higher error-upper bound especially for far away objects and small objects like pedestrians. Based on this observation, we introduce a visible part completion method that requires only 11.3% of the prediction points that previous methods generate. To recover the dense representation, we propose a mesh-deformation-based method to augment the point set associated with visible foreground objects. Considering that our approach focuses only on visible part of the foreground objects to achieve accurate 3D detection, we named our method What You See Is What You Detect (WYSIWYD). Our proposed method is thus a detector-independent model that consists of 2 parts: an Intra-Frustum Segmentation Transformer (IFST) and a Mesh Depth Completion Network(MDCNet) that predicts the foreground depth from mesh deformation. This way, our model does not require the time-consuming full-depth completion task used by most pseudo-lidar-based methods. Our experimental evaluation shows that our approach can provide up to 12.2% performance improvements over most of the public baseline models on the KITTI and NuScenes dataset bringing the state-of-the-art to a new level. The codes will be available at <a href="%7Bhttps://github.com/Orbis36/WYSIWYD%7D" title="" class="ltx_ref ltx_url ltx_font_typewriter" style="color:#0000FF;">{https://github.com/Orbis36/WYSIWYD}</a></p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">For high-performance autonomous driving perception, lidar is probably the most critical sensor. Although we have recently witnessed an increasing amount of work based on lidar-image multimodality input, the lidar features extractor is still used as the mainstream branch in most network design, since it provides accurate depth information.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The main limitation of lidar is the sparsity of its representations: with the depth increasing, the density of the geometric features obtained from the point cloud decreases rapidly. For the lidar-based methods, recent works <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite> have realized that better performance can be obtained by performing shape completion of objects with the network. However, it is important to point out that, most of these works are established under the premise that the first stage 3D Region of Interest(ROI) proposal is accurate enough, such that objects inside the proposed boxes can be refined and completed reliably. Considering that the Region Proposal Network(RPN) module at this stage still needs to face the sparsity of the lidar, especially for distant objects, this precondition can hardly be achieved. At the same time, even if the first stage detection fulfills the requirements, the completion task itself is inherently difficult for sparse inputs when relying only on lidar signal.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">In early multimodal detection networks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>, RGB features are used to decorate points or voxel features. With the research progressing, lifting 2D features to the pseudo lidar virtual points in 3D space has become increasingly popular. The success of recent cross-modality completion-based methods<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite> confirms the appropriateness of this approach. Specifically, SFDNet<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite> has pioneered an attempt to introduce external points to complement the objects. This augmented data from depth completion, is equivalent to interpolating the lidar signals of the objects surface. By fusing this information with real lidar signals, complete objects can thus be generated from sparse point clouds. This enriched 3D point representation has led to significant improvements in performance.</p>

</figure>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">However, it is important to note that these pseudo-lidar representations are still plagued with inherent artifacts introduced by boundary depth dispersion problems, as shown in Fig <a href="#S1.F2" title="Figure 2 ‣ I Introduction ‣ What You See Is What You Detect: Towards better Object Densification in 3D detection" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>. Considering that the ground truth used to train the depth completion network is semi-dense and the inherent smoothing properties of convolutional layers used in these models, the depth estimation of boundary pixels always tends to leak toward the background. As a matter of fact, this issue seriously affects the accuracy of subsequent detections, as it will later be demonstrated in section <a href="#S3.SS1" title="III-A Hypothesis ‣ III Problem Fomulation ‣ What You See Is What You Detect: Towards better Object Densification in 3D detection" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag"><span class="ltx_text">III-A</span></span></a>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Although a recent work <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite> has made it possible to reduce the inaccuracy of the depth estimation through a learnable discard module, models based on depth completion still suffer from two other issues. First, full frame depth completion itself is time-consuming and most of the generated background depth information is useless for the later process. A typical depth completion method like PENet<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite> needs 161ms<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite> per frame when CUDA synchronization is used. In consequence, a complete system based on such a pre-processing network will be far from real-time detection. Second, even if the outlier depth points can be dropped accurately, this discard-based strategy will actually further dilute the already limited amount of semantic information available for small objects.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">In this work, we revisit the fundamental issues related to the quality of foreground depth and our objective is to make the entire detector to get rid of time-consuming full frame depth completion networks. Overall, we only complete the foreground points instead of performing global depth completion. This process can be divided into two steps: <span id="S1.p6.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">foreground points segmentation</span> and <span id="S1.p6.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">object densification</span>.</p>

</figure>
<div id="S1.p7" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p7.1" class="ltx_p">Specifically, we demonstrate that visible part completion leads, in fact, to equivalent or even superior results than full shape completion used by most of the previous methods. This good performance also explains why methods like SFDNet<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite> or VirConv<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite> perform better than more traditional completion-based methods. To estimate the foreground region which needs to be densified, rather than relying on 3D RPNs that are insensitive to sparse objects, we choose to use the well-developed 2D instance segmentation networks. Within the 3D frustum of a specific segmented 2D object, considering the depth distribution of the point cloud, we design a lightweight Transformer, named IFST, to filter out the noise points.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p8" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p8.1" class="ltx_p">Next, different from the existing models that use pseudo points from depth completion, here we chose to reconstruct the object directly from the lidar signal. The points from the IFST still contain some noise, so an ideal model should be able to control the shape and be invariant to noise as well. To fulfill such requirement, we integrated a mesh deformation approach to completion-based 3D detection for the first time. Through a lidar aggregation layer, we make the mesh learn the distribution of the lidar signal in a coarse to fine manner and restore the shape of the object progressively. Notably, the consistency of the resulting mesh is guaranteed and the vertex will not leak into the background benefiting from the specific guidance of the Laplacian loss.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p9" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p9.1" class="ltx_p">It is also worth noting that although there are several works that claim to produce accurate point cloud completion<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>, they have all been tested in a noiseless or indoor environment. Few studies have demonstrated that they can be adapted to the case of sparse inputs.</p>

In comparison to 3D detection, image-based detection, and segmentation tasks have reached a high level of performance in recent years. With the help of a 2D detection module, F-PointNet<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite> introduced intra-frustum detection to filter out the background points. F-Convnet<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite> then further developed the idea by proposing a sliding windows approach inside the frustum. A similar strategy was also adopted to obtain better fusion results in F-fusion<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>. Considering that distant objects can still be well-detected in RGB images, FarFrustum<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite> further improved detection performance at different objects scale. The recent years have observed a rapid growth of works that utilize the well-developed 2D perception to guide 3D detection. FSF<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite> uses points in instance segmentation masks to augment the quality of lidar foreground queries before sending them to the Transformer Layer. MVF<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite> utilizes the masks from 2D segmentation to add virtual points in 3D space. Frustumformer <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite> proposed an instance-aware resampling method to better utilize the more informative foreground pixels in BEV representation.</p>

<p id="S2.p2.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S2.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Fusion in homogeneous space.</span> From the accuracy point of view, the ROI (region of interest) level fusion performed in MV3D <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite> and AVOD<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite>, in which features are learned in separate spaces but fused by concatenation or other learning-based method directly, is undoubtedly not optimal. The Deep Continuous Fusion<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite>, pioneered the exploration of interpolating RGB features and using them as subsidiary information for lidar voxels or points to participate in detection. This method can also be observed in several 3D detection pipelines <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>. However, the mentioned cross-modality methods still adopt lidar as the mainstream detector and do not allow point clouds to be complemented by the RGB features. The image information in the sparse part of the lidar remains underutilized.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">To address the inadequate information fusion due to point cloud sparsity, several recent approaches have realized that fusion performed in homogeneous space, normally 3D space, can significantly improve performance. Specifically, following the method in FCOS3D<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite>, the HomoFusion<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite> projects lidar points to FOV and constructs depth confidence intervals for the RGB features, These points are sent to 3D space in order to perform homogeneous fusion. Furthermore, VPFNet<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite> constructs virtual points from the foreground pixels to improve the utilization of local point clouds and RGB information. Through their virtual points multi-depth unprojection, MSMDFusion<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite> also reaches SOTA performance on nuScenes.</p>

Intuitively, a more complete shape can clearly improve detection accuracy. Considering that over half of hard samples in KITTI contain no more than 30 points, object completion in lidar representation has therefore a high potential to significantly improve the performance of a 3D detector. However, the estimation of shape and position requires strong prior knowledge, which is difficult to learn through detection networks. Current works in object completion-assisted detection can be broadly divided into two categories: using pseudo points obtained by pre-computed deep completion networks or through a sub-network densifying foreground points or voxels.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p5.1" class="ltx_p">For the former, SFDNet<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite> introduced the first detection architecture that includes a depth completion module. VirConv<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite> further proposed Noise-Resistant Submanifold Convolution to identify and exclude the points for which the depth is incorrectly estimated. PseudoLidar++<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite> proposed a KNN-based traditional optimization algorithm, which corrects the position of pseudo points obtained by monocular 3D detection while maintaining the real-time nature of the network.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p6.1" class="ltx_p">For the latter, BtcDet <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite> designed an occlusion prediction sub-network to recover the missing points by self or external occlusion in a cylindrical coordinate system. SPG<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite> chose to densify the foreground points by an unsupervised expansion process. Sparse2Dense<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite> expressed this process more implicitly. In this work, densification is considered as a distance optimization problem under the hidden space.

<p id="S3.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">A typical pseudo-points-based detector method needs an upstream depth completion module, in which the depth of every pixel is estimated. Here we use SFDNet<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite> as the testbed to explore the relation between the accuracy of foreground points and 3D detection. The authors of SFDNet mentioned PENet<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite> and TWISE<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">38</a>]</cite> in their paper and implementation but only adopted the latter in the published code. Consequently, we first simply replace this completion module with different depth completion methods to verify their effectiveness inside the downstream 3D detection.</p>

<p id="S3.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">As shown in Fig. <a href="#S3.F3" title="Figure 3 ‣ III-A Hypothesis ‣ III Problem Fomulation ‣ What You See Is What You Detect: Towards better Object Densification in 3D detection" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a>, the highest 3D detection performance occurs when TWISE is used. But when applying RMSE, the criterion for evaluating the performance of depth completion, TWISE obtains the worst results (as shown by the pink line). Considering that the RMSE evaluates both foreground and background depth, while the foreground is more critical to 3D detection, we speculate that TWISE<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">38</a>]</cite> obtain a better performance in foreground depth prediction. To verify this hypothesis, we need to generate the ground truth of foreground depth, since the lidar points cannot guaranteed that all pixels in the 2D foreground region can get a depth estimate. This generation process is introduced in section <a href="#S3.SS2" title="III-B Dense depth generation of visible part ‣ III Problem Fomulation ‣ What You See Is What You Detect: Towards better Object Densification in 3D detection" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag"><span class="ltx_text">III-B</span></span></a> and will later be used to estimate the RMSE of the foreground objects in section <a href="#S3.SS3" title="III-C Completion Method Comparasion ‣ III Problem Fomulation ‣ What You See Is What You Detect: Towards better Object Densification in 3D detection" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag"><span class="ltx_text">III-C</span></span></a>.</p>

The plain green line here demonstrates that among all candidate models, TWISE can achieve the best performance in foreground depth prediction. We thus showed that the key reason TWISE benefit downstream 3D detection is its high quality foreground depth prediction. In other words, the higher the foreground pseudo points quality, the better our 3D model performance. Pursuing with this idea, next we will present the result of using the generated ground truth to train a model directly. We will explore the upper boundary performance of this completion method and compare it with that obtained from the full completion.</p>

<p id="S3.SS3.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Here we select 4 recent lidar detection models, which take the original lidar points and augmented points from different methods as input. As shown in Table 1, a wide performance increment can be observed especially in pedestrian detection. With only 11.3% (on average) of the points contained in full shape completion, in most cases, the improvement of our proposed completion approach can be up to 8.5%. We also noticed that worse results happen in the hard category, which can be explained by the small number of pixels available.</p>

We believe this result can also be used to explain why the recent proposed depth completion model can outstand the vanilla shape completion-based methods: the former actually provides an overall higher upper boundary and needs less points to be predicted.</p>

<p id="S4.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In order to identify the foreground points that need to be densified, we first project all lidar points onto a 2D mask which is obtained from an image instance segmentor. Although this approach successfully removes most irrelevant background points, it is worth mentioning that there may still be some noisy lidar points within the frustum due to inaccuracies in 2D segmentation and potential occlusions in 3D space. So we propose a lightweight transformer network to identify the foreground lidar points. In the subsequent step, by considering the depth of each pixel as a vertex, a mesh deformation-based network will densify the sparse lidar signal, allowing downstream detectors to benefit from this augmented pseudo-point representation. The overall structure of our model is illustrated in Figure <a href="#S4.F5" title="Figure 5 ‣ IV-B Intra-Frustum points segmentation ‣ IV Proposed Method ‣ What You See Is What You Detect: Towards better Object Densification in 3D detection" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5</span></a> and Figure <a href="#S4.F6" title="Figure 6 ‣ IV-B Intra-Frustum points segmentation ‣ IV Proposed Method ‣ What You See Is What You Detect: Towards better Object Densification in 3D detection" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">6</span></a>.</p>

Inspired by recently proposed depth completion networks<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib44" title="" class="ltx_ref">44</a>, <a href="#bib.bib45" title="" class="ltx_ref">45</a>]</cite>, the core of our Mesh Depth Completion Network (MDCNet) design is a geometric position-based hierarchical Transformer that allows the model to learn from points at different locations while still maintaining a strong prior: to estimate the depth of a specific pixel, neighboring lidar points in 2D space are more referential. It is the role of the aggregation layer to make the network learn from real lidar point distribution and densify the mesh in an iterative manner.</p>

The final transformer block was added to allow the network to learn features from other vertex directly, instead of by multiple neighborhood propagation in later GNNs.
Note that the hop of our network is quite larger than the classic scenario for GNNs, e.g. a social network or recommender systems, in which hop is around 6-10<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib48" title="" class="ltx_ref">48</a>, <a href="#bib.bib49" title="" class="ltx_ref">49</a>]</cite>.

In this paper, thanks to the lightweight design of the module, all training is done by a single RTX3090. For the training of the baseline models, we used batches equal to 8 for 80 epochs training and other settings remain as in available implementation.

The BtcDet only released configuration on car detection training, therefore the pedestrian items are not reported in the Table. Our proposed method also provides the highest performance improvement in all 3 pedestrian detection categories and most car detection categories when compared to the evaluated methods.</p>

We attribute this to the detector independence of the proposed method. The added complementary point cloud is not perfect, as shown in Fig. <a href="#S6.F7" title="Figure 7 ‣ VI-B Component-wise Analysis ‣ VI Ablation study ‣ V-B Main results ‣ V-A Experimental setup ‣ V Experiments ‣ What You See Is What You Detect: Towards better Object Densification in 3D detection" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">7</span></a>, and from time to time the point cloud boundary exceeds the 3D GT box due to the inaccuracy of the 2D detection. Considering there is no specific design in the downstream detector to filter this noise, this seriously affects the performance of 3D detection under the 0.7/0.7/0.7 thresholds. However, if the thresholds are relaxed to 0.7/0.5/0.5, as shown in Table <a href="#S6.T5" title="TABLE V ‣ VI-A Overall Analysis ‣ VI Ablation study ‣ V-B Main results ‣ V-A Experimental setup ‣ V Experiments ‣ What You See Is What You Detect: Towards better Object Densification in 3D detection" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">V</span></a>, the combination of Voxel-RCNN+WYSIWYD remains optimal in terms of performance. So in this way, the utilization of the proposed model can essentially mitigate the miss detection and low IOU detection problems.</p>

In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>, the time reported is not CUDA synchronized, which means the next frame can actually be processed when the GPU is available, as mentioned in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>. When this is taken into account, the mentioned method will need more than 200 ms for single-frame inference. However, in our model, thanks to the fact that MDCNet is designed to only complete foreground points, compared to VirConv, the proposed method brings a 34.4 % efficiency improvement.</p>
