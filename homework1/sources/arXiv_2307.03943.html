<p id="id11.id1" class="ltx_p">The task of Camouflaged Object Detection (COD) aims to accurately segment camouflaged objects that integrated into the environment, which is more challenging than ordinary detection as the texture between the target and background is visually indistinguishable. In this paper, we proposed a novel Feature Grafting and Distractor Aware network (FDNet) to handle the COD task. Specifically, we use CNN and Transformer to encode multi-scale images in parallel. In order to better explore the advantages of the two encoders, we design a cross-attention-based Feature Grafting Module to graft features extracted from Transformer branch into CNN branch, after which the features are aggregated in the Feature Fusion Module. A Distractor Aware Module is designed to explicitly model the two possible distractor in the COD task to refine the coarse camouflage map. We also proposed the largest artificial camouflaged object dataset which contains 2000 images with annotations, named ACOD2K. We conducted extensive experiments on four widely used benchmark datasets and the ACOD2K dataset. The results show that our method significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art methods. The code and the ACOD2K will be available at https://github.com/syxvision/FDNet.</p>

<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Camouflage refers to creatures use the similarity of color, texture, etc. to hide themselves in the background without being discovered by predators. Inspired by the natural camouflage of animals such as chameleon, artificial camouflage was created to deceive human’s visual inspection. The computer vision task of Camouflaged Object Detection (COD) aims to accurately segment concealed objects from the background environment, which has recently attracted interests of researchers and facilitated many applications in different fields. However, due to its inherent nature, locating and segmenting of camouflaged objects is much more difficult than ordinary object detection, which makes the COD task extremely challenging.</p>

<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Recently, many deep learning based methods have been proposed to solve the COD task and have achieved impressive progress. SegMaR <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite> introduces a Magnification Module to iteratively upsample images to segment camouflaged objects with complex structures. ZoomNet <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite> showed that multi-scale information is very effective for resolving the appearance and shape variation of objects at different scales. This model uses a shared encoder to encode images of three scales. However, shared encoders cannot take full advantage of multi-scale images and may cause error propagation. Therefore, we proposed use two different encoders in parallel, and designed a Feature Grafting Module for better feature transfer.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Existing COD methods only consider the background as distractor, such as SINetv2 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite> which uses reverse attention to erase the foreground and use the background to mine potential camouflage areas. However, in the COD task, due to the similarity between the object and the surrounding environment, there are two different types of distractors as shown in Figure <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ I Introduction ‣ Camouflaged Object Detection with Feature Grafting and Distractor Aware *Corresponding author.

This observation inspired us that explicitly modeling semantic features of these two types of distractors with supervision can improve detection performance.</p>

<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we propose a Feature Grafting and Distractor Aware network (FDNet) for camouflaged object detection. We employ Transformer and CNN to exploit information on different scales, where Transformer models long-term dependence for rich context information and CNN mines local details for edge information. To aggregate the features from these two encoders, we developped a Feature Grafting Module based on cross-attention, which fuses features in a bottom-up manner to produce a coarse prediction map. A Distractor Aware Module was designed to guide the learning by modeling the two types of distractor and exploring potential camouflage regions under the supervision of groundtruth. Benefited from the designed modules, our proposed network can better recognize distractors and achieve better detection performance.</p>

<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The release of large-scale camouflage datasets (such as COD10K <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>) has triggered the invention of many deep learning-based methods, which have shown impressive results for the COD task. A majority of the recent work are inspired by how human observers visually search camouflaged targets, as SINet <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>, ZoomNet <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite> and SegMaR <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>. SINet was designed to have two stages for searching and recognition respectively. ZoomNet <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite> and the recently proposed SegMaR <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite> enlarge the image in potential target regions to further mine distinguishing clues in a coarse-to-fine manner. Other work proposed to use auxiliary cues to improve performance, such as making better use of boundary clues <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite> and frequency-domain perceptual cues <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>. The joint task learning was also found to be useful when SOD(Salient Object Detection) and COD are simultaneously considered to boost each other’s performance <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>.</p>

<div id="S3.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Camouflage images can be categorized as natural or artificial. Natural camouflage refers to the ability of animals to blend into their surroundings through changes in their physiological characteristics, making them difficult to detect by predators. Artificial camouflage refers to camouflage designed using human reasoning through methods such as painting and camouflage uniforms, with a specific aim to target human visual perception characteristics in order to more effectively deceive the human visual system. It has great practical value for tasks such as disaster-assisted search and rescue operations. Leveraging this advantage, we have constructed ACOD2K, the largest artificial camouflage dataset.</p>
</div>
<div id="S3.SS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">It’s worth noting that current camouflaged object detection methods are exclusively trained on natural camouflaged images. This is because existing datasets mainly feature natural camouflaged animals, making it difficult to train models that can accurately detect artificial camouflage. For instance, the two most commonly used training datasets in COD tasks, CAMO and COD10K, have an imbalanced distribution of natural and artificial camouflage images. Of the 2,500 images in CAMO, less than 10<math id="S3.SS1.p2.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\%" display="inline"><semantics id="S3.SS1.p2.1.m1.1a"><mo id="S3.SS1.p2.1.m1.1.1" xref="S3.SS1.p2.1.m1.1.1.cmml">%</mo><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S3.SS1.p2.1.m1.1b"><csymbol cd="latexml" id="S3.SS1.p2.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.SS1.p2.1.m1.1.1">percent</csymbol></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S3.SS1.p2.1.m1.1c">\%</annotation></semantics></math> are artificial camouflage images. Similarly, COD10K, a large-scale dataset with 10,000 images covering multiple camouflaged objects in natural scenes divided into 5 super classes, lacks artificial camouflage images. This highlights the need for datasets like ACOD2K, which has a significant number of artificial camouflage images, to enable the development of more robust camouflaged object detection methods.</p>

It is divided into two stages, the first stage generates a coarse feature map, and the second stage refines the feature map based on the Distractor Aware Module. FDNet uses multi-scale images as input. Unlike ZoomNet which uses shared encoders, we instead used the PVT <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite> for the main scale and used the Res2Net50 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite> for the sub-scale, which constitue a parallel encoder. We designed a Feature Grafting Module based on cross-attention to aggregate features of these two scales, which not only extracts valuable semantic clues, but also fully suppresses redundant information and background noise. Then the multi-scale features are sent to the Feature Fusion Module for decoding, it achieved more efficient transmission of encoded information through bottom-up dense connections. Finally, Send it into the dual-branch Distractor Aware Module to refine the feature map, and use ground truth for supervision.</p>

We believe that using simple fusion methods such as pooling, concatenation, or addition is not effective enough for mutual learning between these two features, and cannot well suppress background noise from CNN. Therefore, we use cross-attention to incorporate the global semantic cue learned from the main scale into each pixel of the sub-scale.

We first element-wise multiply it with the current layer features to suppress background interference that may cause abnormality, and then preserve the original information by residual addition.

In A, we removed all key modules, only used single-scale images, and simply perform convolution after channel concatenation to get the final prediction map. In B, we replaced the Feature Fusion Module on the basis of A. In C, we use multi-scale images, but share the encoder, and the features of different scales are fused by pooling. In D, we use CNN and Transformer to encode the images of two scales respectively, and use the Feature Grafting Module to fuse feature. In E, we added Distractor Aware Module based on D.</p>

<div id="S5.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We propose a novel COD network, FDNet. First, we design the Feature Grafting Module to extract valuable semantic information and suppress background noise. Then, in the Distractor Aware Module, we obtained more accurate prediction map by refining the two types of distractors. Additionally, we also construct a new artificial camouflage dataset, ACOD2K. Experiments on four public datasets and ACOD2K show that our method outperforms other methods significantly both qualitatively and quantitatively. In the future, we will explore more effective supervision methods for two types of distractors.</p>
