<p id="4.1" class="ltx_p">Conventional methods for human pose estimation either require a high degree of instrumentation, by relying on many inertial measurement units (IMUs), or constraint the recording space, by relying on extrinsic cameras. These deficits are tackled through the approach of human pose estimation from sparse IMU data. We define attention-oriented adjacency adaptive graph convolutional long-short term memory networks (A3GC-LSTM), to tackle human pose estimation based on six IMUs, through incorporating the human body graph structure directly into the network. The A3GC-LSTM combines both spatial and temporal dependency in a single network operation, more memory efficiently than previous approaches. The recurrent graph learning on arbitrarily long sequences is made possible by equipping graph convolutions with adjacency adaptivity, which eliminates the problem of information loss in deep or recurrent graph networks, while it also allows for learning unknown dependencies between the human body joints. To further boost accuracy, a spatial attention formalism is incorporated into the recurrent LSTM cell.
With our presented approach, we are able to utilize the inherent graph nature of the human body, and thus can outperform the state of the art for human pose estimation from sparse IMU data.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Acorrect estimation of human poses is important in many applications. These range from various applications in virtual and augmented reality <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite> to medical applications, such as gait analysis <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>, patient monitoring  <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite> or human activity recognition  <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>.
Unfortunately, today’s state of the art (SOTA) methods for human pose estimation either only work in constrained environments, or are very intrusive <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>.
These constraints make them impractical for outdoor applications, indoor scenarios spanning multiple rooms or suffering from occlusions <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>. Measuring the human body pose with body-worn IMUs can solve these deficits <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>. To aid user acceptance and usability, the number of body mounted sensors must be minimal, resulting in sparse inertial measurements.
In this paper, we propose a novel approach for human pose estimation based on a set of 6 IMUs. While this scenario has been tackled by others before <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>, we are the first to enhance pose estimation accuracy by incorporating the structure of the human body through deep graph learning, instead of predicting the pose from a flat array of input data.
While using graph structures in deep neural networks is a well studied field <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>, the usage of standard graph convolutions in recurrent architectures poses the same over-smoothing problem as in other deep graph architectures <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>.
To address this challenge, we propose the usage of adjacency adaptive graph convolutions (A2GC) directly inside the recurrent cell. Doing so requires significantly less memory during training, as compared to approaches exploiting graph convolutions with learnable adjacency matrices in different fields <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>.
We further equip this new type of LSTM cell with an attention formalism, defining our attention-oriented adjacency adaptive graph convolutional LSTM cells (A3GC-LSTM), with which we are able to outperform the SOTA on sparse IMU driven human pose estimation.
To further improve pose estimation, we show how A3GC-LSTMs benefit from respecting the bilateral body symmetry, by utilizing contralateral data augmentation.
This augments the available training data by mirroring all movements, which increases the range of possible motions in the training data and for instance removes any bias of left- or right-handedness in the data.
<br class="ltx_break">Thus, within this paper we propose the first graph convolution approach to solve sparse IMU-based pose estimation, and we make the following technical contributions in this context:</p>

Human pose estimation can be tackled by various approaches.
These range from the setup of multiple calibrated cameras and body worn markers <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite> over approaches using RGBD cameras <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>, or ultrasonic technology <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>, to such based on monocular RGB input <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>, <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>, <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>.
These approaches however all have in common, that they can only operate in a constrained volume given by the field of view of the involved sensors.
These problems are lifted by completely body-worn systems.
While also other systems have been proposed <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>, IMU based systems have the benefit of being light weight, small and widely available.
Today, such systems are commercially available, whereby IMU measurements from different units are fused to reconstruct a subject’s pose <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite>.
While they yield good results, their large amount of required IMUs, e.g., 17 IMUs in Xsens’ current MVN setup for full pose estimation<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite>, can be considered intrusive, require long setup times, and provoke sensor placement errors.
To tackle these shortcomings, several methods have been proposed to reduce the amount of necessary sensors.
Many such approaches are limited in application by matching query samples to prerecorded databases <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>, <a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite> or training a model for each activity of interest <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite>.
Von Marcard et al. instead use a generative approach to estimate 3D poses from only 6 IMUs with their sparse inertial poser (SIP) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>.
To do so, they equip the Skinned Multi-Person Linear (SMPL) body model <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite> with synthetic IMUs, and solve for the SMPL pose that best matches the measured IMU data. As this has to be done at query time, it is a computationally expensive procedure.
With the deep inertial poser (DIP) Huang et al. have enhanced the accuracy of pose estimation based on 6 IMUs using a deep learning approach <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>.
They built a bidirectional LSTM network <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite> to map the flattened input of 5 IMUs, normalized by a 6th IMU on the pelvis, to the target pose in the SMPL body model.
In contrast to the deep learning approaches the use of shallow fully connected networks has been proposed <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite>.
Yi et al. proposed an improvement for the deep architectures by predicting intermediate representations, along with a network branch for global position estimation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>.
With their Transpose network they effectively apply the network of DIP on three subsequent steps, where they first predict the position of leaf joints from the IMU data, then the position of all joints from the former joints as well as the IMU data, and finally the target pose in the SMPL model using the IMU data and the position of all joints as input.
Recently, they further improved the accuracy by introducing a physics-based in the physical inertial poser (PIP) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>. PIP combines the Transpose network with a non-learnable physically driven module to postprocess the model predictions.
Sparse IMU input has also been used in combination with RGB cameras <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>, <a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>, <a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>, <a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>]</cite> as well as RGBD cameras <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>]</cite>. While these approaches show increased accuracy over camera-only methods, they still suffer from the constraints which come with the use of cameras.
Thus, while traditional work requires an environment constrained by at least one camera, or is limited by existing databases, DIP <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite> and Transpose <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite> take the next step, by incorporating modern learning approaches.
While they can be considered SOTA with respect to accuracy, they do not consider the graph nature of the human body as they operate on flattened data.

<p id="S2.p3.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S2.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Graph learning.</span>
Graph learning has proven beneficial in many disciplines <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>.
Graph learning has been used for human body related tasks, by mapping a 2D pose, predicted from static RGB images, to a 3D pose <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">38</a>]</cite>, eliminating the need to cope with time dependencies.
Several approaches have been proposed which work with spatio-temporal data by separating the spatial and temporal learning steps.
These separations are either a consecutive application of graph convolutions (GCN) and recurrent layers <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">39</a>, <a href="#bib.bib40" title="" class="ltx_ref">40</a>]</cite>, or of GCNs in space and convolutions in time domain consecutively <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib41" title="" class="ltx_ref">41</a>, <a href="#bib.bib42" title="" class="ltx_ref">42</a>]</cite>.
Some of these methods modulate the fixed adjacency of the underlying graph by incorporating learnable adjacency components.
The combination of spatial and temporal dependencies has been proposed for different tasks.
Bai et al. build the adjacency matrix out of a learnable embedding of all graph nodes and use them in gated recurrent units (GRUs) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib43" title="" class="ltx_ref">43</a>]</cite> for traffic forecasting.
While such an embedding has benefits for large graphs, it is not beneficial for small graphs as encountered in our tasks.
Li et al. have proposed graph-based GRU cells (G-GRU) for human motion prediction, in which they also employ an adaptive adjacency matrix <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>. To employ this adaptivity, they modulate the fixed adjacency matrix with a multiplicative and an additive weight matrix before using it in a GCN to modify the cells hidden input state.
While we consider it counter-intuitive to just add a graph computation to the network while keeping the linear computation, it also requires a significantly larger memory footprint than our approach, as we will detail in section <a href="#S4.SS1" title="4.1 Quantitative Evaluation ‣ 4 Experiments ‣ A3GC-IP: Attention-Oriented Adjacency Adaptive Recurrent Graph Convolutions for Human Pose Estimation from Sparse Inertial Measurements" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4.1</span></a>.
LSTMs differ from GRUs by having a better deep context understanding <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib44" title="" class="ltx_ref">44</a>]</cite>, which makes them better suited to tasks such as human pose estimation, where input sequences can consist of data recorded with 60Hz, while the context of movements can span from only a few frames to many seconds.
While the over-smoothing problem of deep GCN networks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite> has been tackled in the spatial domain <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib45" title="" class="ltx_ref">45</a>]</cite> by introducing initial residual connections and identity mapping to the GCN, this is not applicable to recurrent architectures.

<p id="S2.p4.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S2.p4.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Attention.</span>
While the usage of attention has originally gained popularity for natural language processing<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib46" title="" class="ltx_ref">46</a>, <a href="#bib.bib47" title="" class="ltx_ref">47</a>]</cite>, it has since been applied to many different fields<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib48" title="" class="ltx_ref">48</a>, <a href="#bib.bib49" title="" class="ltx_ref">49</a>]</cite>.
Si et al. use a combination of LSTMs and GCNs with fixed adjacency together with an attention mechanism for human activity recognition <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib50" title="" class="ltx_ref">50</a>]</cite>.
While they obtain good results, their model was defined for short sequences (up to 100 frames) with densely annotated graphs as input, and does not scale well to our problem with indefinitely long sequences and sparse inputs. Thus we combine this spatial attention approach with our A2GC-LSTMs.</p>

<p id="S3.p1.5" class="ltx_p">In this section, we detail the technical concepts behind our proposed graph convolution approach. The input of our model is the data of 5 IMUs placed on the SMPL skeletal graph, whereby their input is transformed into a body-centric system as per Huang et al. by a 6th IMU on the pelvis <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>.
We also train towards the SMPL body model <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite> as target, in order to obtain realistic poses, and allow for comparison to the SOTA.
To incorporate body topology, we transform the IMU input to a graph structure by automatically placing the sensors on a human skeletal graph at the corresponding nodes.
For this graph we chose the SMPL skeletal model, whereby we focus on only 15 core joints out of the 24 joints of the model <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite>, i.e., without the outer extremities of hands, feet and the root joint (see Fig. <a href="#S3.F2" title="Figure 2 ‣ 3 The Method ‣ A3GC-IP: Attention-Oriented Adjacency Adaptive Recurrent Graph Convolutions for Human Pose Estimation from Sparse Inertial Measurements" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>).
We chose this focus due to the fact, that the information sparse IMUs can give for the former is naturally limited, while the root joint at the pelvis is fixed by definition through the data transformation with respect to it.
The nodes containing no IMU measurements are initialized with zeros in the input graph. Thus, we operate on an input graph of dimensionality <math id="S3.p1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="N\times F_{in}" display="inline"><semantics id="S3.p1.1.m1.1a"><mrow id="S3.p1.1.m1.1.1"

The core of our model is the combination of LSTM cells and GCNs in a bidirectional recurrent layer.
As the inclusion of standard GCNs in recurrent applications suffers from over-smoothing problems as described by Li et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>, we introduce adjacency adaptive graph convolution (A2GC) as a remedy.

We will show empirically that the adaptivity of adjacency lifts the problem of over-smoothed results in an automated manner (Sec. <a href="#S4.SS3" title="4.3 Ablation Study ‣ 4 Experiments ‣ A3GC-IP: Attention-Oriented Adjacency Adaptive Recurrent Graph Convolutions for Human Pose Estimation from Sparse Inertial Measurements" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4.3</span></a>).
In addition to the necessity of adjacency adaptivity in our application we assume another benefit of the learnable adjacency, which is the hardly factorizable dependency of all joints to each other.
The problem in factorization of all joint dependencies comes from the fact, that biological joints are not only actuators driven by many muscles, but even in a free state underlie many factors of dampening <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib52" title="" class="ltx_ref">52</a>, <a href="#bib.bib53" title="" class="ltx_ref">53</a>]</cite>.
Thus the free joint, i.e. one not actively driven by muscular movement, is affected by all other joints both through the connection along a line of damped oscillators, as well as by inertia, as the skeleton is neither completely stiff.
While it is true that all effects will always also effect the neighbouring joints, it can be better for the model to learn dependencies to the other joints as well, as this will give the context to small changes in acceleration or rotation.
Using this definition of the A2GC operation inside LSTM cells (A2GC-LSTM) thus not only lifts the over-smoothing problem, but also allows for learning of unknown joint dependencies.
The definition of the A2GC-LSTM cell follows on a coarse level the definition of the conventional LSTM cell <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib54" title="" class="ltx_ref">54</a>, <a href="#bib.bib55" title="" class="ltx_ref">55</a>]</cite>, whereby in the A2GC-LSTM cell we replace every learnable network operation with A2GCs:</p>

Thus, we are able to combine the spatial and temporal learning part in a single recurrent cell, and are able to learn all dependencies of a current state in a single computation.
This is desirable as the spatial context needs to be accessible for every joint to define the pose. Furthermore, since the single pose is only a discrete timestep in a continuous movement, the temporal dependency must be accessible to consider the pose in a coherent context of an animation.
As such, the pose of a raised arm could inherit from a raising arm movement or of relaxing an arm from a raised pose, in which the sensor rotation values will be identical while the temporal information puts the sparse acceleration data in a temporal context better suited for robust estimation.

We define the general layout of our model in Fig. <a href="#S3.F3" title="Figure 3 ‣ 3 The Method ‣ A3GC-IP: Attention-Oriented Adjacency Adaptive Recurrent Graph Convolutions for Human Pose Estimation from Sparse Inertial Measurements" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a>.
For the setup of our A3GC-IP model we follow the training scheme of Transpose<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite> by separating the pose learning task into three steps. First, the IMUs are assigned to the corresponding graph nodes and fed into an A3GC network learning the position of the leaf joints.
These are then concatenated along the feature dimension of each joint with the IMU input and fed to the second network learning the position of all joints.
After concatenating again with the input data the resulting graph is given as input to a third A3GC network to predict the rotation of all joints, i.e. the <math id="S3.p9.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\theta" display="inline"><semantics id="S3.p9.1.m1.1a"><mi id="S3.p9.1.m1.1.1" xref="S3.p9.1.m1.1.1.cmml">θ</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S3.p9.1.m1.1b"><ci id="S3.p9.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.p9.1.m1.1.1">𝜃</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S3.p9.1.m1.1c">\theta</annotation></semantics></math> parameters of the SMPL model defining the pose. In contrast to Transpose the leaf joints in our model are not head, hands and feet, but the outermost joints of our graph, i.e. head, elbows and knees.
The A3GC networks consist of four layers. The input and output layer is given by A2GCs and the two core layers are bidirectional A3GC-LSTM layers.
We train our model towards global rotations, using an MSE loss function:

To lift this bias and at the same time enhance the amount of available training sequences, we can utilize the joint based bilateral symmetry of the human body by applying contralateral data augmentation (CDA) prior to training.
With CDA we mirror every sequence along the body’s main axis with the following procedure.
We first swap the rotation values of the bilaterally symmetric joints.
Following the notation in Fig. <a href="#S3.F2" title="Figure 2 ‣ 3 The Method ‣ A3GC-IP: Attention-Oriented Adjacency Adaptive Recurrent Graph Convolutions for Human Pose Estimation from Sparse Inertial Measurements" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a> this means joint 3 is swapped with joint 4 and similarly for the pairs {(0,1), (8,9), (11,12) and (13,14)}.

For the synthetic data this mirroring is done before synthesizing the IMU data, and for the real training data, the same scheme is applied to the IMU rotations with the mirrored joint pairs (3,4) and (13,14) bearing IMU sensors.

This retraining and evaluation procedure does not only enable a direct comparison, but also allows for constraining the synthetic IMU data generation to only those sequences, not contained in any of the tests sets, a requirement which would otherwise be violated by the original Transpose train/test split, which also contains Total Capture sequences.

<p id="S4.SS1.p1.2" class="ltx_p"><span id="S4.SS1.p1.2.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Model accuracy.</span> We evaluate the methods on four metrics. These are the mean joint angle error with respect to the joints selected for analysis by Huang et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite> building on the work of SIP <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>, as well as the mean joint error for angle, position and jerk with respect to all 15 joints.
The first metric only evaluates the error on the shoulders and hip joints (joints 0, 1, 11 and 12 according to the numbering introduced in Fig. <a href="#S3.F2" title="Figure 2 ‣ 3 The Method ‣ A3GC-IP: Attention-Oriented Adjacency Adaptive Recurrent Graph Convolutions for Human Pose Estimation from Sparse Inertial Measurements" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>), which is a meaningful decision to analyze the general capability of the model to generalize to the full pose from the IMU measurements, as there is no IMU data directly available for these joints, but they still are part of the extremities and thus a good indicator for the correctness of the pose.
As this gives no direct information of the total accuracy for the pose estimation, we employ the other three metrics on the complete skeleton.
Angle and position are used together to give a valid expression of the correctness of the pose.
The error on the jerk as the third derivative of position, measures the temporal stability of the prediction relative to the ground truth by quantifying effects such as trembling of joints or body parts in the prediction, which are still in the ground truth and vice versa. To get the values for position and jerk, we compute the respective joint positions using the SMPL body model given the true and predicted <math id="S4.SS1.p1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\theta" display="inline"><semantics id="S4.SS1.p1.1.m1.1a"><mi id="S4.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1" xref="S4.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml">θ</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S4.SS1.p1.1.m1.1b"><ci id="S4.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1">𝜃</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S4.SS1.p1.1.m1.1c">\theta</annotation></semantics></math> values.

We report the comparison of our models with the SOTA in Table <a href="#S3.T1" title="TABLE I ‣ 3 The Method ‣ A3GC-IP: Attention-Oriented Adjacency Adaptive Recurrent Graph Convolutions for Human Pose Estimation from Sparse Inertial Measurements" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">I</span></a>, whereby we compare the models after finetuning on the DIP-IMU train and validation split. The errors reported are the mean and standard deviation over all sequences, timesteps and the respective number of joints.
In addition to the SOTA methods for our problem, we also compare to the method of Li et al. (G-GRU) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>, as it is most comparable to our LSTM formulation. As it is build for a different task, we test it by keeping our model architecture and replacing our proposed A3GC-LSTMs with their G-GRU formulation.
<br class="ltx_break">The first observation we can make is that the proposed A3GC-IP model shows the best scores on almost all metrics.
The only exclusion from this is the DIP-error on the Total Capture dataset, on which our model is beaten by DIP, while at the same time our model shows the best score on the angle error with respect to all joints by a large margin.
This is connected to the observation that the overall accuracy by employing global target rotations on DIP is greatly increased, while the accuracy on the Total Capture dataset is decreased.
From this we can deduct that a model trained towards global target rotations has a significantly better predictive quality on data similar to the training data, but loses some of the generalization capability towards unseen, more different data.
The fact that the angular error of DIP is very close to the global variant of DIP but the DIP-error being significantly lower, indicates that local target rotations lead to a more even distribution of the error across the skeleton.
The results of G-GRU show that the simple inclusion of a graph formalism into the network by any method does not increase the accuracy of the model, as it is at best on par with Transpose.
Thus we can conclude that it is the specific formulation of the A3GC cell leading to a better performance.

In the first two rows wee see two example poses with bend legs. Here we observe that our model is much closer to the ground truth than the SOTA, which is most significant in the leg positions. In the third row we show an example of an upright pose where both Transpose and our method introduce a wrong rotation of the knees towards the body center. Nevertheless our model does this to a smaller extent and at the same time manages to keep the unbent pose of the torso, different to the SOTA. In the last row we show an example of a faster movement in form of a jumping pose. While out method shows significant differences to the ground truth here, it is significantly closer to the ground truth than Transpose with respect to the arm, leg and head pose.</p>

On top we see an example of a pose in midst of a long jump, which is both rare in the data and very short timed. While our model fails to correctly estimate this pose, it is still visibly closer to the ground truth than Transpose regarding the arm and leg poses. In the second example we observe an example of a rare and rather unnatural movement of crouch-walk using the hands as support on the ground. As movements like this are not part of the DIP-IMU dataset and thus not in the real data used for finetuning, both models fail to predict a pose anywhere close to the ground truth. While our model is a bit closer in the leg pose, at the same time Transpose can predict the forwards bending of teh Torso to a better degree. Thus, visually, we cannot regard any method to be the better one in this case.
In addition to this short discussion we encourage the reader to watch the supplemental video, in which we show more sequences in animation to get a better understanding of the quality of the predictions, as these are difficult to capture in static images.</p>

</h3>

<div id="S4.SS3.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this section we analyze the effects of different aspects of our model.
We detail the results of this ablation study in Table <a href="#S4.T2" title="TABLE II ‣ 4.1 Quantitative Evaluation ‣ 4 Experiments ‣ A3GC-IP: Attention-Oriented Adjacency Adaptive Recurrent Graph Convolutions for Human Pose Estimation from Sparse Inertial Measurements" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">II</span></a>.
The ablations are conducted separately on the contralateral data augmentation (<em id="S4.SS3.p1.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">A3GC -CDA</em>), the attention formalism introduced inside the LSTM cell (<em id="S4.SS3.p1.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">A3GC -Attention</em>) and the adjacency adaptivity inside the LSTM cell (<em id="S4.SS3.p1.1.3" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">A3GC -Adjacency Adaptivity</em>), while the rest of the model and training are kept the same.
We note that for the ablation of adjacency adaptivity the input and output A2GC layers remain unchanged and that this results in a formulation of the LSTM cell similar to Si et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib50" title="" class="ltx_ref">50</a>]</cite>.
The results show that each of the ablated aspects is vital to the performance of our proposed model.
We further observe that the inclusion of spatial attention inside the LSTM cell leads to a better generalization capability, as the effect on DIP-IMU is rather insignificant, but notable on Total Capture.
In addition the ablation of adjacency adaptivity inside the LSTM cell shows that the application of spatial attention alone is not sufficient for a good estimation, as the score on all metrics is significantly worse for this cases. Lastly the contralateral data augmentation gives an additional increase in the score on both datasets and all metrics.</p>

<div id="S5.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper we have shown that the utilization of the human body graph structure with A3GC-IP leads to better generalization towards pose estimation of unobserved movements. We base this on the following observations. (i) the estimation of the complete skeletal pose showed significant increases in accuracy compared to the prior SOTA.
This was achieved by (ii) combining the spatio-temporal processing of the sequential movement data in a single step, for which we proposed the A3GC-LSTM cell, which processes both spatial and temporal dependencies of the data in one recurrent cell with a significantly lower amount of parameters needed as compared to existing methods. In addition to this we (iii) report a boost in accuracy by utilizing the bilateral symmetry of the human body through contralateral data augmentation.
All code necessary to reproduce our results, including the trained models is publicly available on GitHub (Link will be provided upon acceptance of the paper, code is supplied to reviewers in supplemental material).</p>
