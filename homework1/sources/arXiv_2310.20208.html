<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">Recent camouflaged object detection (COD) attempts to segment objects visually blended into their surroundings, which is extremely complex and difficult in real-world scenarios.
Apart from the high intrinsic similarity between camouflaged objects and their background, objects are usually diverse in scale, fuzzy in appearance, and even severely occluded.
To this end, we propose an effective unified collaborative pyramid network which mimics human behavior when observing vague images and videos, <span id="id1.id1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">i.e.</span>, zooming in and out.
Specifically, our approach employs the zooming strategy to learn discriminative mixed-scale semantics by the multi-head scale integration and rich granularity perception units, which are designed to fully explore imperceptible clues between candidate objects and background surroundings.
The former’s intrinsic multi-head aggregation provides more diverse visual patterns.
The latter’s routing mechanism can effectively propagate inter-frame difference in spatiotemporal scenarios and adaptively ignore static representations.
They provides a solid foundation for realizing a unified architecture for static and dynamic COD.
Moreover, considering the uncertainty and ambiguity derived from indistinguishable textures, we construct a simple yet effective regularization, uncertainty awareness loss, to encourage predictions with higher confidence in candidate regions.
Our highly task-friendly framework consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in image and video COD benchmarks.

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Camouflaged objects are often “seamlessly” integrated into the environment by changing their appearance, coloration or pattern to avoid detection, such as chameleons, cuttlefishes and flatfishes.
This natural defense mechanism has evolved in response to their harsh living environments.
Broadly speaking, camouflaged objects also refer to objects that are extremely small in size, highly similar to the background, or heavily obscured.
They subtly hide themselves in the surroundings, making them difficult to be found, <span id="S1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">e.g.</span>, soldiers wearing camouflaged uniforms and lions hiding in the grass.
Therefore, camouflaged object detection (COD) presents a significantly more intricate challenge compared to traditional salient object detection (SOD) or other object segmentation.
Recently, it has piqued ever-growing research interest from the computer vision community and facilitates many valuable real-life applications, such as search and rescue <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>, species discovery <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>, medical analysis (<span id="S1.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">e.g.</span>, polyp segmentation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>, lung infection segmentation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>, and cell segmentation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>), agricultural management <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>, and industrial defect detection <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>.</p>

The main purpose of our proposed framework.
The static image or video clip containing camouflaged objects can be fed into our network to yield accurate masks using the same architecture.
The proposed framework, founded on the flexible routing mechanism, unifies and simplifies the processing pipeline of image and video COD tasks.
Specifically, feature propagation inside multiple-scale pyramids with different information granularities ensures the accurate capture of imperceptible objects.
Furthermore, the difference-aware adaptive routing mechanism empowers the proposed method with temporal conditional interaction capability only for video data, which provides a solid foundation for perceiving camouflaged objects within both image and video data.

<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Recently, numerous deep learning-based methods have been proposed and achieved significant progress.
Nevertheless, they still struggle to accurately and reliably detect camouflaged objects, due to the visual insignificance of camouflaged objects, and high diversity in scale, appearance and occlusion.
By observing our experiments, it is found that the current COD detectors are susceptible to distractors from background surroundings.
Thus it is difficult to excavate discriminative and subtle semantic cues for camouflaged objects, resulting in the inability to clearly segment the camouflaged objects from the chaotic background and the predictions of some uncertain (low-confidence) regions.
In addition, recent works <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite> have attempted to introduce temporal motion cues of objects to further expand the information dimension of the COD task.
However, as shown in Fig. <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ ZoomNeXt: A Unified Collaborative Pyramid Network for Camouflaged Object Detection" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>, the existing best solutions for image <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite> and video <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite> COD tasks have different information emphases (<span id="S1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">i.e.</span>, the appearance information of static images and the motion information of videos), resulting in incompatibility in architecture design and feature pipeline between the two types of tasks.
Taking these into mind, in this paper, we summarize the COD issue into three aspects:
1) <span id="S1.p2.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">How to accurately locate camouflaged objects under conditions of inconspicuous appearance and various scales?</span>
2) <span id="S1.p2.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">How to design a unified framework that is compatible with both image and video feature processing pipelines?</span>
3) <span id="S1.p2.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">How to suppress the obvious interference from the background and infer camouflaged objects more reliably?</span>
Intuitively, to accurately find the vague or camouflaged objects in the scene, humans may try to refer to and compare the changes in the shape or appearance at different scales by zooming in and out the image or video.
This specific behavior pattern of human beings motivates us to identify camouflaged objects by mimicking the zooming in and out strategy.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">With this inspiration, in this paper, we propose a unified collaborative pyramid network, named <span id="S1.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">ZoomNeXt</span>, which significantly improves the existing camouflaged object detection performance for the image and video COD tasks.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S1.p4.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Firstly</span>, for accurate object location, we employ scale space theory <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite> to imitate zooming in and out strategy.
Specifically, we design two key modules, <span id="S1.p4.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">i.e.</span>, the multi-head scale integration unit (MHSIU) and the rich granularity perception unit (RGPU).
For the camouflaged object of interest, our model extracts discriminative features at different “zoom” scales using the triplet architecture, then adopts MHSIUs to screen and aggregate scale-specific features, and utilizes RGPUs to further reorganize and enhance mixed-scale features.
The difference-aware adaptive routing mechanism of the module RGPU can also make full use of the inter-frame motion information to capture camouflaged objects in the video.
This flexible data-aware architecture design seamlessly unifies the processing pipeline for static images and video clips into a single convolutional model.
Thus, our model is able to mine the accurate and subtle semantic clues between objects and backgrounds under mixed scales and diverse scenes, and produce accurate predictions.
Besides, the shared weight strategy used in the proposed method achieves a good balance of efficiency and effectiveness.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S1.p5.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Secondly</span>, the last aspect is related to reliable prediction in complex scenarios.
Although the object is accurately located, the indistinguishable texture and background will easily bring negative effects to the model learning, <span id="S1.p5.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">e.g.</span> predicting uncertain/ambiguity regions, which greatly reduces the detection performance and cannot be ignored.
This can be seen in Fig. <a href="#S4.F9" title="Figure 9 ‣ 4.1.3 Implementation Details ‣ 4.1 Experiment Setup ‣ 4 Experiments ‣ ZoomNeXt: A Unified Collaborative Pyramid Network for Camouflaged Object Detection" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">9</span></a> (Row 3 and 4) and Fig. <a href="#S4.F10" title="Figure 10 ‣ 4.1.3 Implementation Details ‣ 4.1 Experiment Setup ‣ 4 Experiments ‣ ZoomNeXt: A Unified Collaborative Pyramid Network for Camouflaged Object Detection" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">10</span></a>.
To this end, we design a uncertainty awareness loss (UAL) to guide the model training, which is only based on the prior knowledge that a good COD prediction should have a clear polarization trend.
Its GT-independent characteristic makes it suitable for enhancing the GT-based BCE loss.
This targeted enhancement strategy can force the network to optimize the prediction of the uncertain regions during the training process, enabling our ZoomNeXt to distinguish the uncertain regions and segment the camouflaged objects reliably.</p>

<p id="S2.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The study of camouflage has a long history in biology.
This behavior of creatures in nature can be regarded as the result of natural selection and adaptation.
In fact, in human life and other parts of society, it also has a profound impact, <span id="S2.SS1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">e.g.</span>, arts, popular culture, and design.

Overall framework of the proposed ZoomNeXt.
The shared triplet feature encoder is used to extract multi-level features corresponding to different input “zoom” scales.
At different levels of the scale merging subnetwork, MHSIUs are adopted to screen and aggregate the critical cues from different scales.
Then the fused features are gradually integrated through the top-down up-sampling path in the hierarchical difference propagation decoder.
RGPUs further enhance the feature discrimination by constructing a multi-path structure inside the features.
Finally, the probability map of the camouflaged object corresponding to the input image or frame can be obtained.
In the training stage, the binary cross entropy and the proposed uncertainty awareness loss are used as the loss function.

Due to the differences in the attributes of the objects of interest, the goals of the two tasks are different.

Some uncertainty-aware methods <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>, <a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>, <a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">36</a>]</cite> are proposed to model and cope with the uncertainty in data annotation or COD data itself.
In the other methods <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>, <a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">38</a>]</cite>, contextual feature learning also plays an important role.
And <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">39</a>]</cite> introduces an explicit coarse-to-fine detection and iterative refinement strategy to refine the segmentation effect.
Compared to convolutional neural networks, the vision transformer can encode global contextual information more effectively and also change the way existing methods <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib40" title="" class="ltx_ref">40</a>, <a href="#bib.bib41" title="" class="ltx_ref">41</a>, <a href="#bib.bib42" title="" class="ltx_ref">42</a>, <a href="#bib.bib43" title="" class="ltx_ref">43</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite> perceive contextual information.
Specifically, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib43" title="" class="ltx_ref">43</a>]</cite> are based on the strategy of dividing and merging foreground and background to accurately distinguish highly similar foreground and background.
<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite> utilizes the multi-scale correlation aggregation and the spatiotemporal transformer to construct short-term and long-term information interactions, and optimize temporal segmentation.
<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib40" title="" class="ltx_ref">40</a>]</cite> aims to enhance locality modeling of the transformer-based model and the feature aggregation in decoders, while <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib41" title="" class="ltx_ref">41</a>]</cite> preserves detailed clues through the high-resolution iterative feedback design.
In addition, there are also a number of bio-inspired methods, such as <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>, <a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib44" title="" class="ltx_ref">44</a>]</cite>.
They capture camouflaged objects by imitating the behavior process of hunters or changing the viewpoint of the scene.</p>

<p id="S2.SS2.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Although our method can also be attributed to the last category, ours is different from the above methods.
Our method simulates the behavior of humans to understand complex images by zooming in and out strategy.
The proposed method explores the scale-specific and imperceptible semantic features under the mixed scales for accurate predictions, with the supervision of BCE and our proposed UAL.
At the same time, through the adaptive perception ability of the temporal difference, the proposed method also harmonizes both image and video data in a single framework.
Accordingly, our method achieves a more comprehensive understanding of the diverse scene, and accurately and robustly segments the camouflaged objects from the complex background.</p>

<div id="S2.SS3.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Conditional computation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib45" title="" class="ltx_ref">45</a>]</cite> refers to a series of carefully constructed algorithms in which each input sample actually uses only a subset of feature processing nodes.
It can further reduce computation, latency, or power on average, and increase model capacity without a proportional increase in computation.
As argued in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib45" title="" class="ltx_ref">45</a>]</cite>, <span id="S2.SS3.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">sparse activations</span> and <span id="S2.SS3.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">multiplicative connections</span> may be useful ingredients of conditional computation.
Over the past few years, it has become an important solution to the time-consuming and computationally expensive training and inference of deep learning models.
Specifically, as a typical paradigm, the mixture of experts (MoE) technique <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib46" title="" class="ltx_ref">46</a>]</cite> based on sparse selection has shown great potential on a variety of different types of tasks, including language modeling and machine translation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib47" title="" class="ltx_ref">47</a>]</cite>, multi-task learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib48" title="" class="ltx_ref">48</a>]</cite>, image classification <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib49" title="" class="ltx_ref">49</a>, <a href="#bib.bib50" title="" class="ltx_ref">50</a>]</cite>, and vision-language model <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib51" title="" class="ltx_ref">51</a>]</cite>.
Existing methods mainly rely on MoE and gating strategies to realize dynamic routing of feature flow nodes, and focus on the distinction between different samples of homogeneous data.
In the proposed scheme, we propose a new form of conditional computation for differentiated processing of image and video data.
Specifically, we construct adaptive video-specific bypasses using the inter-frame difference in video, which automatically ”ignores” static images for good task compatibility.</p>

<div id="S2.SS4.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The scale-space theory aims to promote an optimal understanding of image structure, which is an extremely effective and theoretically sound framework for addressing naturally occurring scale variations.
Its ideas have been widely used in computer vision, including the image pyramid <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib52" title="" class="ltx_ref">52</a>]</cite> and the feature pyramid <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib53" title="" class="ltx_ref">53</a>]</cite>.
Due to the structural and semantic differences at different scales, the corresponding features play different roles.
However, the commonly-used inverted pyramid-like feature extraction structures <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib54" title="" class="ltx_ref">54</a>, <a href="#bib.bib55" title="" class="ltx_ref">55</a>, <a href="#bib.bib56" title="" class="ltx_ref">56</a>]</cite> often cause the feature representation to lose too much texture and appearance details, which are unfavorable for dense prediction tasks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib57" title="" class="ltx_ref">57</a>, <a href="#bib.bib58" title="" class="ltx_ref">58</a>]</cite> that emphasize the integrity of regions and edges.
Thus, some recent CNN-based COD methods <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>, <a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">38</a>, <a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">37</a>, <a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite> and SOD methods <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib59" title="" class="ltx_ref">59</a>, <a href="#bib.bib60" title="" class="ltx_ref">60</a>, <a href="#bib.bib61" title="" class="ltx_ref">61</a>, <a href="#bib.bib62" title="" class="ltx_ref">62</a>, <a href="#bib.bib63" title="" class="ltx_ref">63</a>, <a href="#bib.bib64" title="" class="ltx_ref">64</a>, <a href="#bib.bib65" title="" class="ltx_ref">65</a>]</cite> explore the combination strategy of inter-layer features to enhance the feature representation.
These bring some positive gains for accurate localization and segmentation of objects.
However, for the COD task, the existing approaches overlook the performance bottleneck caused by the ambiguity of the structural information of the data itself which makes it difficult to be fully perceived at a single scale.
Different from them, we mimic the zoom strategy to synchronously consider differentiated relationships between objects and background at multiple scales, thereby fully perceiving the camouflaged objects and confusing scenes.
Besides, we also further explore the fine-grained feature scale space between channels.</p>

The overall architecture of the proposed method is illustrated in Fig. <a href="#S2.F2" title="Figure 2 ‣ 2.1 Camouflaged Object ‣ 2 Related Work ‣ ZoomNeXt: A Unified Collaborative Pyramid Network for Camouflaged Object Detection" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>.
Inspired by the zooming strategy from human beings when observing confusing scenes, we argue that different zoom scales often contain their specific information.
Aggregating the differentiated information on different scales will benefit exploring the inconspicuous yet valuable clues from confusing scenarios, thus facilitating COD.
To implement it, intuitively, we resort to the image pyramid.
Specifically, we customize an image pyramid based on the single scale input to identify the camouflaged objects.
The scales are divided into a main scale (<span id="S3.SS1.p2.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">i.e.</span> the input scale) and two auxiliary scales.
The latter is obtained by re-scaling the input to imitate the operation of zooming in and out.</p>

<p id="S3.SS1.p3.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S3.SS1.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Feature Processing</span>
We utilize the shared triplet feature encoder to extract features on different scales and feed them to the scale merging subnetwork.
To integrate these features that contain rich scale-specific information, we design a series of multi-head scale integration units (MHSIUs) based on the attention-aware filtering mechanism.
Thus, these auxiliary scales are integrated into the main scale, <span id="S3.SS1.p3.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">i.e.</span>, information aggregation of “zoom in and out” operation.
This will largely enhance the model to distill critical and informative semantic cues for capturing difficult-to-detect camouflaged objects.
After that, we construct rich granularity perception units (RGPUs) to gradually integrate multi-level features in a top-down manner to enhance the mixed-scale feature representation.
It further increases the receptive field range and diversifies feature representation within the module.
The captured fine-grained and mixed-scale clues promote the model to accurately segment the camouflaged objects in the chaotic scenes.</p>

Similar to the multi-scale case, different channels also contain differentiated semantics.
Thus, it is necessary to excavate valuable clues contained in different channels.
To this end, we design the rich granularity perception unit (RGPU) to conduct information interaction and feature refinement between channels, which strengthen features from coarse-grained group-wise iteration to fine-grained channel-wise modulation in the decoder, as depicted in Fig. <a href="#S3.F4" title="Figure 4 ‣ 3.2 Triplet Feature Encoder ‣ 3 Method ‣ ZoomNeXt: A Unified Collaborative Pyramid Network for Camouflaged Object Detection" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a>.</p>

Such an iterative mixing strategy strives to learn the critical clues from different channels and obtain a powerful feature representation.
The iteration structure of feature groups in RGPU is actually equivalent to an integrated multi-path kernel pyramid structure with partial parameter sharing.
Such a design further enriches the ability to explore diverse visual cues, thereby helping to better perceive objects and refine predictions. The iteration processing is also listed in Alg. <a href="#alg1" title="In 3.4 Hierarchical Difference Propagation Decoder ‣ 3 Method ‣ ZoomNeXt: A Unified Collaborative Pyramid Network for Camouflaged Object Detection" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>.</p>

Comparisons of different methods on video COD datasets.
“T” represents the number of frames in the video clip.
“T=1” is the model without temporal difference, where the dynamic routing is not activated.
“T=5” is our final model for the video COD task due to its better performance.

It can be seen that the proposed model consistently and significantly surpasses recent methods on all datasets without relying on any post-processing tricks.
Compared with the recent several best methods with different backbones, ZoomNet <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>, DGNet <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite> and SARNet <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib43" title="" class="ltx_ref">43</a>]</cite> for image COD and STL-Net-LT <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite> for video COD, although they have suppressed other existing methods, our method still shows the obvious improvement over the conference version <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite> and the performance advantages over recent methods on these datasets.

Our curves are almost horizontal, which can be attributed to the effect of the proposed UAL.
It drives the predictions to be more polarized and reduces the ambiguity.</p>

Visual comparisons of different methods on several typical samples are shown in Fig. <a href="#S3.F7" title="Figure 7 ‣ 3.5 Loss Functions ‣ 3 Method ‣ ZoomNeXt: A Unified Collaborative Pyramid Network for Camouflaged Object Detection" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">7</span></a> and Fig. <a href="#S3.F8" title="Figure 8 ‣ 3.5 Loss Functions ‣ 3 Method ‣ ZoomNeXt: A Unified Collaborative Pyramid Network for Camouflaged Object Detection" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">8</span></a>.
They present the complexity in different aspects, such as
small objects (Row 3-5),
middle objects (Row 1 and 2),
big objects (Row 6-8),
occlusions (Row 1 and 6),
background interference (Row 1-3 and 6-8),
and indefinable boundaries (Row 2, 3, and 5) in Fig. <a href="#S3.F7" title="Figure 7 ‣ 3.5 Loss Functions ‣ 3 Method ‣ ZoomNeXt: A Unified Collaborative Pyramid Network for Camouflaged Object Detection" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">7</span></a>,

These results intuitively show the superior performance of the proposed method.
In addition, it can be noticed that our predictions have clearer and more complete object regions, sharper contours, and better temporal consistency.</p>

<p id="S4.SS3.SSS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In the proposed model, both the MHSIU and the RGPU are very important structures.
We install them one by one on the baseline model to evaluate their performance.
The results are shown in Tab. <a href="#S4.T3" title="TABLE III ‣ 4.1.3 Implementation Details ‣ 4.1 Experiment Setup ‣ 4 Experiments ‣ ZoomNeXt: A Unified Collaborative Pyramid Network for Camouflaged Object Detection" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">III</span></a>.
Note that only the inputs of the main scale are used in our baseline “0” and the models “1.x”.
As can be seen, our baseline shows a good performance, probably due to the more reasonable network architecture.
From the table, it can be seen that the two proposed modules make a significant contribution to the performance when compared to the baseline.
Besides, the visual results in Fig. <a href="#S4.F9" title="Figure 9 ‣ 4.1.3 Implementation Details ‣ 4.1 Experiment Setup ‣ 4 Experiments ‣ ZoomNeXt: A Unified Collaborative Pyramid Network for Camouflaged Object Detection" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">9</span></a> show that the two modules can benefit each other and reduce their errors to locate and distinguish objects more accurately.
These components effectively help the model to excavate and distill the critical and valuable semantics and improve the capability of distinguishing hard objects.
Under the cooperation between the proposed modules and the proposed loss function, ZoomNeXt can completely capture the camouflaged objects of different scales and generate the predictions with higher consistency.</p>

The recursive iteration strategy in the proposed RGPU stimulates the potential semantic diversity of feature representation.

<span id="S4.SS3.SSS2.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Although increasing the number of groups introduces more parameters and computation, the performance does not keep increasing.</span>
It can be seen from the results that the best performance appears when the number of groups is equal to 6 and also achieves a good balance between performance and efficiency.
So we use 6 groups as the default setting in all RGPUs.</p>

We list the efficiency and performance of different settings in Tab. <a href="#S4.T3" title="TABLE III ‣ 4.1.3 Implementation Details ‣ 4.1 Experiment Setup ‣ 4 Experiments ‣ ZoomNeXt: A Unified Collaborative Pyramid Network for Camouflaged Object Detection" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">III</span></a>.
The comparison shows that an increase in the number of heads improves computing efficiency and even performance.

Since there is no difference in the time dimension when only a single frame is input, the corresponding model only uses static processing nodes.
As more frames are fed, adaptively activated network nodes by differential information for the inter-frame interaction further improve the performance on video COD.</p>

<p id="S4.SS3.SSS4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Our model is designed to mimic the behavior of “zooming in and out”.
The feature expression is enriched by combining the scale-specific information from different scales.
In Fig. <a href="#S4.F10" title="Figure 10 ‣ 4.1.3 Implementation Details ‣ 4.1 Experiment Setup ‣ 4 Experiments ‣ ZoomNeXt: A Unified Collaborative Pyramid Network for Camouflaged Object Detection" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">10</span></a>, the intermediate features from the deep MHSIU modules show that our mixed-scale scheme plays a positive and important role in locating the camouflaged object.
To analyze the role of different scales, we summarize the performance of different combination forms on two large-scale datasets COD10K <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite> and NC4K <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite> in Tab. <a href="#S4.T4" title="TABLE IV ‣ 4.3 Ablation Studies ‣ 4 Experiments ‣ ZoomNeXt: A Unified Collaborative Pyramid Network for Camouflaged Object Detection" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">IV</span></a>.
The proposed scheme performs better than the single-scale one and simply mixed one.
This verifies the rationality of such a design for the COD task.</p>

This may be due to the advantage of its smooth change process.
This smooth intensity warm-up strategy of UAL motivates the model to take advantage of UAL in improving the learning process and to mitigate the possible negative interference of UAL on BCE due to the lower accuracy of the model during the early stage of training.</p>

Further, from the gradient of the loss function illustrated in Fig. <a href="#S4.F12" title="Figure 12 ‣ 4.3.4 Mixed-scale Input Scheme ‣ 4.3 Ablation Studies ‣ 4 Experiments ‣ ZoomNeXt: A Unified Collaborative Pyramid Network for Camouflaged Object Detection" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">12</span></a>, there is a good collaboration between the proposed UAL and BCE.
In the early training phase, the UAL is suppressed and the gradient is dominated by the BCE, thus facilitating a more stable optimization.
However, in the later stage, the gradient of UAL is inversely proportional to <math id="S4.SS3.SSS5.p3.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\Delta" display="inline"><semantics id="S4.SS3.SSS5.p3.1.m1.1a"><mi mathvariant="normal" id="S4.SS3.SSS5.p3.1.m1.1.1" xref="S4.SS3.SSS5.p3.1.m1.1.1.cmml">Δ</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S4.SS3.SSS5.p3.1.m1.1b"><ci id="S4.SS3.SSS5.p3.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS3.SSS5.p3.1.m1.1.1">Δ</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S4.SS3.SSS5.p3.1.m1.1c">\Delta</annotation></semantics></math> representing the certainty of the prediction.
Such a design enables UAL to speed up updating simple samples.
At the same time, it does not rashly adjust difficult samples, because they need more guidance from the ground truth.</p>

<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we propose ZoomNeXt by imitating the behavior of human beings to zoom in and out on images and videos.
This process actually considers the differentiated expressions about the scene from different scales, which helps to improve the understanding and judgment of camouflaged objects.
We first filter and aggregate scale-specific features through the scale merging subnetwork to enhance feature representation.
Next, in the hierarchical difference propagation decoder, the strategies of grouping, mixing, and fusion further mine the mixed-scale semantics.
Lastly, we introduce the uncertainty awareness loss to penalize the ambiguity of the prediction.
And, to the best of our knowledge, we are the first to unify the pipelines of image and video COD into a single framework.
Extensive experiments verify the effectiveness of the proposed method in both the image and video COD tasks with superior performance to existing state-of-the-art methods.</p>
